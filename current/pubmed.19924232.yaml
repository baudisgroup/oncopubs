abstract: MiRNAs regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level and their
  dysregulation can play major roles in the pathogenesis of many different forms of
  cancer, including neuroblastoma, an often fatal paediatric cancer originating from
  precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system. We have analyzed a set of neuroblastoma
  n 145 that is broadly representative of the genetic subtypes of this disease for
  miRNA expression 430 loci by stem-loop RT qPCR and for DNA copy number alterations
  array CGH to assess miRNA involvement in disease pathogenesis. The tumors were stratified
  and then randomly split into a training set n 96 and a validation set n 49 for data
  analysis. Thirty-seven miRNAs were significantly over- or under-expressed in MYCN
  amplified tumors relative to MYCN single copy tumors, indicating a potential role
  for the MYCN transcription factor in either the direct or indirect dysregulation
  of these loci. In addition, we also determined that there was a highly significant
  correlation between miRNA expression levels and DNA copy number, indicating a role
  for large-scale genomic imbalances in the dysregulation of miRNA expression. In
  order to directly assess whether miRNA expression was predictive of clinical outcome,
  we used the Random Forest classifier to identify miRNAs that were most significantly
  associated with poor overall patient survival and developed a 15 miRNA signature
  that was predictive of overall survival with 72.7 sensitivity and 86.5 specificity
  in the validation set of tumors. We conclude that there is widespread dysregulation
  of miRNA expression in neuroblastoma tumors caused by both over-expression of the
  MYCN transcription factor and by large-scale chromosomal imbalances. MiRNA expression
  patterns are also predicative of clinical outcome, highlighting the potential for
  miRNA mediated diagnostics and therapeutics.
