abstract: Clonal chromosomal changes in multiple myeloma MM and related disorders
  are not well defined, mainly due to the low in vivo and in vitro mitotic index of
  plasma cells. This difficulty can be overcome by using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , a DNA-based technique that gives information about chromosomal copy number
  changes in tumors. We have performed CGH on 25 cases of MM, 4 cases of monoclonal
  gammopathy of uncertain significance, and 1 case of Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia.
  G-banding analysis of the same group of patients demonstrated clonal chromosomal
  changes in only 13 43 , whereas by CGH, the number of cases with clonal chromosomal
  gains and losses increased to 21 70 . The most common recurrent changes detected
  by CGH were gain of chromosome 19 or 19p and complete or partial deletions of chromosome
  13. 19, an anomaly that has so far not been detected as primary or recurrent change
  by G-banding analysis of these tumors, was noted in 2 cases as a unique change.
  Other recurrent changes included gains of 9q, 11q, 12q, 15q, 17q, and 22q and losses
  of 6q and 16q. We have been able to narrow the commonly deleted regions on 6q and
  13q to bands 6q21 and 13q14-21. Gain of 11q and deletion of 13q, which have previously
  been associated with poor outcome, can thus be detected by CGH, allowing the use
  of this technique for prognostic evaluation of patients, without relying on the
  success of conventional cytogenetic analysis.
