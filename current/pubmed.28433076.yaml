abstract: Spitzoid neoplasms are a distinct group of melanocytic tumors. Genetically,
  they lack mutations in common melanoma-associated oncogenes. Recent studies have
  shown that spitzoid tumors may contain a variety of kinase fusions, including ROS1,
  NTRK1, ALK, BRAF, and RET fusions. We report herein the discovery of recurrent NTRK3
  gene rearrangements in childhood melanocytic neoplasms with spitzoid and/or atypical
  features, based on genome-wide copy number analysis by single-nucleotide polymorphism
  array, which showed intragenic copy number changes in NTRK3. Break-apart fluorescence
  in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of NTRK3 rearrangement, and a novel
  MYO5A-NTRK3 transcript, representing an in-frame fusion of MYO5A exon 32 to NTRK3
  exon 12, was identified using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends-based anchored
  multiplex PCR assay followed by next-generation sequencing. The predicted MYO5A-NTRK3
  fusion protein consists of several N-terminal coiled-coil protein dimerization motifs
  encoded by MYO5A and C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain encoded by NTRK3, which is
  consistent with the prototypical structure of TRK oncogenic fusions. Our study also
  demonstrates how array-based copy number analysis can be useful in discovering gene
  fusions associated with unbalanced genomic aberrations flanking the fusion points.
  Our findings add another potentially targetable kinase fusion to the list of oncogenic
  fusions in melanocytic tumors.
