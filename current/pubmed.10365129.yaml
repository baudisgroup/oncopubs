abstract: Multifocality occurs in 12-22 of all renal cell carcinoma RCC cases. In
  order to differentiate multifocal RCC, we performed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and correlated the results with histopathological and clinical data. After histopathological
  examination of multifocal tumors, tumor areas were dissected from histopathological
  sections. Isolated DNA was amplified by DOP-PCR. CGH was performed according to
  standard protocols. Twenty cases were analyzed. In eight cases, at least one identical
  aberration was detected in the related tumors. Another eight cases showed different
  chromosomal changes in tumors of the same kidney. In the small additional clear
  cell tumors typical genetic alterations of clear cell carcinomas were detected whereas
  in the chromophilic tumors aberrations characterizing both adenomas and carcinomas
  were found. From these results we conclude that multifocal RCC represents a heterogeneous
  group of tumors. The malignant potential of small additional tumors in multifocal
  RCC cannot be excluded.
