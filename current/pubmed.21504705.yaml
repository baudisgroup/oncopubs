abstract: Characterization of gross chromosomal rearrangements, particularly translocations
  in neoplasms, has proven to be valuable in patient management by aiding in diagnosis,
  defining prognosis, and leading to new therapeutic interventions. In this report,
  we investigate two apparently balanced translocations, t 6 17 q23.3 p13.3 and t
  2 13 p21 q14.11 , in patients with myeloid neoplasms and uncover concomitant microdeletions
  associated with the breakpoints. Breakpoint mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH detected deletions at or adjacent to all breakpoints. Subsequently, array comparative
  genomic hybridization on the 244 K Agilent platform refined the deletion boundaries,
  revealing a 1.7 Mb deletion directly adjacent to the 6q23.3 breakpoint, and a 562
  kb deletion at 17p13.3 in the first case. The second case was found to harbor a
  195 kb deletion at 2p21 and a 1.4 Mb deletion distal to the 13q breakpoint at 13q14.3.
  Additionally, a 133 kb deletion within the breakpoint region at 13q14.11 and a 265
  kb deletion proximal to the breakpoint were discovered, neither of which was detected
  by FISH. Although a gene fusion resulting from either novel rearrangement cannot
  be determined from these data, formation of a fusion transcript cannot be excluded
  because the resolution of the techniques used does not allow definite delineation
  of the breakpoint locations. Although the incidence and clinical relevance of these
  focal imbalances remains to be evaluated, the cases presented here support high
  resolution evaluation of presumably balanced rearrangements in neoplasms. Such imbalances
  may portend important hitherto unrecognized prognostic and diagnostic categories.
