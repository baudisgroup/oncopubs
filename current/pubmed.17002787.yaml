abstract: Conventional cytogenetic and comparative genomic hybridization CGH studies
  in brain malignancies have shown that glioblastoma multiforme GBM is characterized
  by complex structural and numerical alterations. However, the limited resolution
  of these techniques has precluded the precise identification of detailed specific
  gene copy number alterations.
