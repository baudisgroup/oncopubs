abstract: Chromosomal abnormalities are important for the risk stratification of acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL). However, approximately 30% of pediatric and
  50% of adult patients lack abnormalities with clinical relevance by traditional
  cytogenetic analysis. We integrated cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization,
  and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism array results from 60 consecutive
  clinical ALL cases. By cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses,
  recurring abnormalities with clinical relevance were observed in 33 B-cell ALL (B-ALL),
  including t(9;22), hyperdiploidy, KMT2A translocation, ETV6-RUNX1, intrachromosomal
  amplification of chromosome 21, near haploidy or low hypodiploidy, and t(8;22).
  Single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis found additional aberrations with
  prognostic or therapeutic implication in 21 B-ALL and two T-cell ALL, including
  IKZF1 deletion, intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (one case with a
  normal karyotype), low hypodiploidy (two cases with a normal karyotype), and one
  case each with fusion genes ETV6-NTRK3, CRLF2-P2RY8, NUP214-ABL1, and SET-NUP214.
  IKZF1 deletion was noted in nine B-ALL with t(9;22), one B-ALL with t(4;11), five
  B-ALL with a normal karyotype, and three B-ALL with nonrecurring karyotypic abnormalities.
  Combining single-nucleotide polymorphism array with chromosome and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization assays, the detection rate for clinically significant abnormal
  results increased from 56% to 75%. Whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism array
  analysis detects cytogenetically undetectable clinically significant aberrations
  and should be routinely applied at diagnosis of ALL.  Published by Elsevier Inc.
