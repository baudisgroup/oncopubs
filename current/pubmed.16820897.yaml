abstract: In this study, we report cytogenetic findings in two cases of malignant
  peripheral nerve sheath tumor MPNST with hypodiploid karyotypes. A G-band technique,
  multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization m-FISH and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH were used and compared in this investigation. In both tumors, the G-band and
  m-FISH analysis demonstrated multiple rearrangements on chromosomes 1-5, 8-12, 15-17,
  20 and 21, whereas CGH exhibited gains at 8q and 4q. Both of the structural aberrations
  and the genomic imbalances of the chromosomes may play an important role in the
  pathogenesis and development of MPNST. No cytogenetic abnormalities specific for
  MPNST were found in the present cases or in other previously reported cases. This
  may reflect the diversity or heterogeneity of MPNST that exhibit various clinical
  and histological features. However, there are few cases described in detail on a
  morphologic pattern of MPNST, a correlation between the cytogenetic aberrations
  and the histologic patterns are still uncertain.
