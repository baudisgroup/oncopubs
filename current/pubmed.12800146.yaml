abstract: The acute phase of chronic myeloid leukemia CML is accompanied by secondary
  chromosomal changes. The additional changes have a non-random pattern however, highly
  abnormal marker chromosomes are reported in some 20 of abnormal karyotypes. These
  marker chromosomes have proved to be beyond the resolution of conventional G-banding
  analysis. We used molecular cytogenetic techniques to determine the structure of
  complex chromosome markers in 10 CML-derived cell lines after our investigations
  of CML patients in blast crisis. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization identified
  a multitude of structural chromosome aberrations. In addition, genomic gains identified
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH were mapped to highly complex marker chromosomes
  in more than one cell line. The most common genomic loss detected by CGH affected
  chromosome 9, whereas the most common genomic gains affected, in order of frequency,
  the sequences of 8q, 6, and 13q. The smallest discrete amplification on 8q was identified
  in cell line MEG-01. This amplicon contains sequences represented by the marker
  D8S263 RMC08P029 but did not contain the proximal MYC gene or a more distal marker,
  D8S256 RMC08P025. We determined the size of the amplicon to be less than the chromosome
  segment 8q24.12-q24.13. The use of region- and locus-specific probes to analyze
  the organization of highly complex marker structures aided the identification of
  preferentially amplified genomic regions. The resultant amplifications could harbor
  gene s driving disease progression.
