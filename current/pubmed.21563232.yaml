abstract: Identification and characterization of underlying genetic aberrations could
  facilitate diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Copy number analysis using
  array Comparative Genomic Hybridization aCGH on 93 primary ovarian tumors identified
  PI3K AKT pathway as the most frequently altered cancer related pathway. Furthermore,
  survival analyses to correlate gene copy number and mutation data with patient outcome
  showed that copy number gains of PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3R4 in these tumors were
  associated with decreased survival. To confirm these findings at the protein level,
  immunohistochemistry IHC for PIK3CA product p110 and p-Akt was performed on tissue
  microarrays from 522 independent serous ovarian cancers. Overexpression of either
  of these two proteins was found to be associated with decreased survival. Multivariant
  analysis from these samples further showed that overexpression of p-AKT and or p110
  is an independent prognostic factor for these tumors. siRNAs targeting altered PI3K
  AKT pathway genes inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer
  cell lines. In addition, the effect of the siRNAs in different cell lines seemed
  to correlate with the particular genetic alterations that the cell line carries.
  These results strongly support the utilization of PI3K pathway inhibitors in ovarian
  cancer. They also suggest identifying the specific component in the PI3K pathway
  that is genetically altered has the potential to help select the most effective
  therapy. Both mutation as well as copy number changes can be used as predictive
  markers for this purpose.
