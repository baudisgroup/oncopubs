abstract: The molecular mechanisms underlying penile carcinoma are still poorly understood,
  and the detection of genetic markers would be of great benefit for these patients.
  In this study, we assessed the genomic profile aiming at identifying potential prognostic
  biomarkers in penile carcinoma. Globally, 46 penile carcinoma samples were considered
  to evaluate DNA copy-number alterations via array comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) combined with human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping. Specific genes were
  investigated by using qPCR, FISH, and RT-qPCR. Genomic alterations mapped at 3p
  and 8p were related to worse prognostic features, including advanced T and clinical
  stage, recurrence and death from the disease. Losses of 3p21.1-p14.3 and gains of
  3q25.31-q29 were associated with reduced cancer-specific and disease-free survival.
  Genomic alterations detected for chromosome 3 (LAMP3, PPARG, TNFSF10 genes) and
  8 (DLC1) were evaluated by qPCR. DLC1 and PPARG losses were associated with poor
  prognosis characteristics. Losses of DLC1 were an independent risk factor for recurrence
  on multivariate analysis. The gene-expression analysis showed downexpression of
  DLC1 and PPARG and overexpression of LAMP3 and TNFSF10 genes. Chromosome Y losses
  and MYC gene (8q24) gains were confirmed by FISH. HPV infection was detected in
  34.8% of the samples, and 19 differential genomic regions were obtained related
  to viral status. At first time, we described recurrent copy-number alterations and
  its potential prognostic value in penile carcinomas. We also showed a specific genomic
  profile according to HPV infection, supporting the hypothesis that penile tumors
  present distinct etiologies according to virus status.  ï¿½2014 American Association
