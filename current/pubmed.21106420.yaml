abstract: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma MTSCC has recently been integrated
  into the World Health Organization classification. Although MTSCC is generally a
  low-grade carcinoma, MTSCC with high-grade morphology has been recently reported.
  We present the first case of high-grade MTSCC with comparative genomic hybridization
  findings. A 60-year-old Japanese man presented with weight loss and general fatigue.
  He underwent radical nephrectomy because of the clinical diagnosis of renal cancer.
  Histologic examination of renal tumor showed findings of high-grade MTSCC. Comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis showed gain of chromosomes 1q, 7, 16, 19q, and Y
  and loss of chromosomes 1p, 6p, 8p, 11q del 11 q23 , and 13. G-band karyotype showed
  gain of chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 16, and 20 and loss of chromosome 15. Results
  of our molecular genetic analysis support the idea that high-grade MTSCC is a real
  counterpart of low-grade MTSCC. There is no evidence to designate such tumors as
  unclassified renal cell carcinoma.
