abstract: 'Sporadic breast cancer in young women is different from the one in older
  patients regarding pathological features and aggressiveness of the tumors, but the
  spectrum of genetic alterations are largely unknown. We used comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to analyze DNA copy number changes in 88 tumor samples from women
  amp lt 35 years of age. Findings were compared to histopathological data including
  tumor type, grading, lymph nodes and metastasis. Genomic gains clustered to chromosome
  arms 1q 64.8 , 8q 61.4 , 17q 50.0 , 20q 33.0 , 3q 20.5 , 1p 17.0 , 5p 17.0 and 15q
  17 . Losses were commonly located on 8p 19.3 , 11q 11.4 , 16q 11.4 , 17p 11.4 and
  18q 10.2 . A comparison with published CGH data from breast carcinomas of similar
  type and grade showed the following differences: 1 gains were much more frequent
  than losses, and 2 losses on 8p22-p23 were more prevalent in patients with positive
  lymph node metastasis p 0.02 , and Grade III tumors were associated with gains on
  the long arm of chromosome 8 p 0.01 . Therefore, alterations in these genomic regions
  may be responsible for the reduced survival of patients with early onset breast
  cancer.'
