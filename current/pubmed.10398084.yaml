abstract: Sporadic renal cell carcinomas RCCs display different chromosomal abnormalities
  according to their morphology gains of chromosomes 7 and 17 and loss of Y are commonly
  observed in papillary lesions, whereas loss of 3p sequences and multiple losses
  of specific chromosomes are found in non-papillary and chromophobe cell carcinomas,
  respectively. Acquired renal cystic disease ARCD is associated with an increased
  incidence of renal cell tumours, especially papillary lesions. The aim of this study
  was to examine a series of ARCD-related tumours for chromosomal abnormalities and
  to compare the findings with those abnormalities commonly observed in sporadic RCCs.
  Nine tumours from four patients with ARCD were examined using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and interphase cytogenetics. Gain of chromosomes 7 and 17 was
  observed in all four papillary lesions and loss of Y in three. In addition, gain
  of chromosome 16 was observed in three papillary tumours. Three chromophobe RCCs
  originating from the same kidney showed different genomic profiles two had no abnormalities,
  whereas one showed loss of chromosome 17p. Two non-papillary RCCs failed to show
  chromosome 3p alterations. In conclusion, renal cell tumours developing in ARCD
  may show chromosomal abnormalities both similar to and different from those seen
  in sporadic tumours.
