abstract: 'Gain of chromosome 17 is the most prevalent genetic abnormality identified
  in neuroblastoma NB and distal 17q gain has prognostic significance in NB. In this
  report, we have combined array-based comparative genomic hybridization A-CGH and
  gene expression analysis to investigate gene copy number changes and its impact
  on the gene expression level as well as their association with prognosis genes located
  on chromosome 17 in NB tumors. We observed differential gains of chromosome 17 between
  Stages 4- and 4S tumors. We found that WSB1, mapping to 17q11.1, which was frequently
  gained in 4S- tumors and not changed in 4- tumors, showed strong correlations between
  expression level and copy number. Furthermore, the increase of WSB1 gene expression
  is associated with good outcome in patients with NB of all stages. WSB1 also enhances
  the prognostic prediction when combined with other current prognostic factors in
  NB. Our results demonstrate that WSB1 copy number correlates with its expression
  level and that its high expression associates with good prognosis suggesting a possible
  role of this gene in the biology of favorable outcome NB. This article contains
