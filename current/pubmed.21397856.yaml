abstract: Abrogation of negative feedback control represents a fundamental requirement
  for aberrantly activated signaling pathways to promote malignant transformation
  and resistance to therapy. Here we identify URI, which encodes a mitochondrial inhibitor
  of PP1Î³ and PP1Î³-mediated feedback inhibition of S6K1-BAD survival signaling,
  as an oncogene amplified and overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and human
  ovarian carcinomas. URI is an "addicting" oncogene selectively required for the
  survival of ovarian cancer cells with increased URI copy number. By constitutively
  detaining PP1Î³ in inactive complexes, URI sustains S6K1 survival signaling under
  growth factor-limiting conditions and mediates resistance of cells to cisplatin.
  Thus, oncogenic activation of URI defines an important mechanism for activating
  mitochondrial S6K1-BAD signaling and promoting cell survival through disabling PP1Î³-dependent
  negative feedback inhibition.  Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
