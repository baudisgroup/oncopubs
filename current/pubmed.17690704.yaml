abstract: Seventeen ETV6 RUNX1-positive pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias were
  investigated by high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization array
  CGH , gene expression profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Comparing
  the array CGH and gene expression patterns revealed that genomic imbalances conferred
  a great impact on the expression of genes in the affected regions. The array CGH
  analyses identified a high frequency of cytogenetically cryptic genetic changes,
  for example, del 9p and del 12p . Interestingly, a duplication of Xq material, varying
  between 30 and 60 Mb in size, was found in 6 of 11 males 55 , but not in females.
  Genes on Xq were found to have a high expression level in cases with dup Xq a similar
  overexpression was confirmed in t 12 21 -positive cases in an external gene expression
  data set. By studying the expression profile and the proposed function of genes
  in the minimally gained region, several candidate target genes SPANXB, HMGB3, FAM50A,
  HTATSF1 and RAP2C were identified. Among them, the testis-specific SPANXB gene was
  the only one showing a high and uniform overexpression, irrespective of gender and
  presence of Xq duplication, suggesting that this gene plays an important pathogenetic
  role in t 12 21 -positive leukemia.
