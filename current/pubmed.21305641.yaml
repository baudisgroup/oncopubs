abstract: 'Recent developments in genomic technologies have resulted in increased
  understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and emphasized the importance of central
  survival pathways. Here, we use a novel bioinformatic based integrative genomic
  profiling approach to elucidate conserved mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in the three
  commonest non-Hodgkins lymphoma NHL entities: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular
  lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. By integrating genome-wide DNA
  copy number analysis and transcriptome profiling of tumor cohorts, we identified
  genetic lesions present in each entity and highlighted their likely target genes.
  This revealed a significant enrichment of components of both the apoptosis pathway
  and the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, including amplification of the
  MAP3K12 locus in all three entities, within the set of genes targeted by genetic
  alterations in these diseases. Furthermore, amplification of 12p13.33 was identified
  in all three entities and found to target the FOXM1 oncogene. Amplification of FOXM1
  was subsequently found to be associated with an increased MYC oncogenic signaling
  signature, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of FOXM1 resulted in decreased MYC expression
  and induced G2 arrest. Together, these findings underscore genetic alteration of
  the MAPK and apoptosis pathways, and genetic amplification of FOXM1 as conserved
  mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in common NHL entities. Integrative genomic profiling
  identifies common central survival mechanisms and highlights them as attractive
  targets for directed therapy.'
