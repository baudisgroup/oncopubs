abstract: Genomic technologies, such as array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH
  , increasingly offer definitive gene dosage profiles in clinical samples. Historically,
  copy number profiling was limited to large fresh-frozen tumors where intact DNA
  could be readily extracted. Genomic analyses of pre-neoplastic tumors and diagnostic
  biopsies are often limited to DNA processed by formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding
  FFPE . We present specialized protocols for DNA extraction and processing from FFPE
  tissues utilizing DNase processing to generate randomly fragmented DNA. The protocols
  are applied to FFPE clinical samples of varied tumor types, from multiple institutions
  and of varied block age. Direct comparative analyses with regression coefficient
  were calculated on split-sample portion fresh portion FFPE of colorectal tumor samples.
  We show equal detection of a homozygous loss of SMAD4 at the exon-level in the SW480
  cell line and gene-specific alterations in the split tumor samples. aCGH application
  to a set of archival FFPE samples of skin squamous cell carcinomas detected a novel
  hemizygous deletion in INPP5A on 10q26.3. Finally we present data on derivative
  of log ratio, a particular sensitive detector of measurement variance, for 216 sequential
  hybridizations to assess protocol reliability over a wide range of FFPE samples.
