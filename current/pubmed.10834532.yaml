abstract: Comparative genomic hybridisation CGH is a technique which identifies gains
  and losses of DNA sequence copy number in tumours. We used CGH to search for genetic
  changes in one of the most aggressive malignancies--anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
  ATC . For this purpose, we analysed tumour specimens of nine ATCs and DNA of two
  ATC cell lines. CGH detected aberrations in 10 of 11 samples, with a mean number
  of gains or losses per carcinoma of 4.8 range 0-13 . Total or partial changes of
  chromosome 8 n 6 , including gains or losses of 8p n 6 or 8q n 5 were those detected
  most frequently. Chromosome 5p was amplified in five cases. Gains in two of three
  samples were found for 3q, 7p, 11q and 20q. Gains in a fewer number were seen for
  1p 1 case , 1q 1 , 7q 2 , 9q 2 , 11p 2 , 12q 1 , 14 1 , 15 1 , 17q 2 , 18p 2 , 18q
  1 , 20p 1 , 21 2 , Xp 2 and Xq 2 . Losses were less frequent than gains and observed
  for 1p 2 cases , 1q 1 , 2p 1 , 2q 2 , 3p 2 , 3q 1 , 4q 2 , 6q 1 , 9p 2 , 9q 1 ,
  18p 1 , 18q 1 and Y 2 . Examples of analysis of tumour sections and cell lines performed
  by fluorescence in situ hybridisation FISH confirmed the gains and losses found
  by CGH and detected additional signals for 8q21 in tumour cells in a sample with
  no gains or losses normally in CGH. The results suggest that aberrations of 5p,
  8p and 8q, which are rarely found in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, may play
  an important role in the development of ATC. Therefore, these chromosomes could
  harbour gene loci potentially involved in the aggressiveness of neoplastic tumours,
  as shown in tumours such as in this study for ATC.
