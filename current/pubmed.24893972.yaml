abstract: Tumours of the lacrimal gland are rare, but the prognosis may be grave.
  To date, no population-based incidence and distribution data on lacrimal gland tumours
  exist. In addition, almost nothing is known about the genetic profile of epithelial
  tumours of the lacrimal gland. We collected specimens and clinical files on all
  biopsied lacrimal gland lesions in Denmark over a 34-year period and re-evaluated
  the diagnosis to provide updated population-based incidence rates and epidemiological
  characteristics. Clinical data regarding symptoms, clinical examinations, treatment
  and follow-up were collected for patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), pleomorphic
  adenoma (PA), carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (Ca-ex-PA) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma
  (MEC). Using RT-PCR, FISH, immunohistochemistry, Q-PCR and high-resolution array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) we explored the genetic characteristics
  including copy number alterations (CNA) in ACC, PA, Ca-ex-PA and MEC. The incidence
  of biopsied lacrimal gland lesions was 1.3/1,000,000/year, and ~50% were neoplastic
  lesions. Of these, 55% were malignant tumours with epithelial tumours as the most
  frequent. The overall incidence was increasing, and this was caused by an increase
  in biopsied non-neoplastic lesions. We found that 10/14 ACCs either expressed the
  MYB-NFIB fusion gene and/or had rearrangements of MYB. All ACCs expressed the MYB
  protein. ACC was characterized by recurrent copy number losses involving 6q, 12q
  and 17q and gains involving 19q, 8q and 11q. ArrayCGH revealed an apparently normal
  genomic profile in 11/19 PAs. The remaining 8 PAs had recurrent copy number losses
  involving 1p, 6q, 8q and 13q and gain involving 9p. PA expressed PLAG1 in all tumours
  whereas only 2/29 tumours expressed HMGA2. Ca-ex-PA was characterized by recurrent
  copy number gain involving 22q. PLAG1 was expressed in 3/5 Ca-ex-PA whereas none
  of these tumours expressed HMGA2. MEC expressed the CRTC1-MAML2, and this fusion
  was found to be tumour-specific for lacrimal gland MEC. In conclusion, lacrimal
  gland lesions that require pathological evaluation are rare in the Danish population,
  and the incidence rate of biopsied benign lesions is increasing. Epithelial tumours
  of the lacrimal gland are molecularly very similar to their salivary gland counterparts
  in the expression of the tumour-specific fusion genes and in their genomic imbalances
  as demonstrated by arrayCGH. MYB-NFIB is a useful biomarker for ACC and MYB, and
  its downstream target genes may be potential therapeutic targets for these tumours.  ï¿½
