abstract: A series of 23 children with primitive neuroectodermal tumours PNET were
  analysed with comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Multiple chromosomal imbalances
  have been detected in 20 patients. The most frequently involved chromosome was chromosome
  17, with a gain of 17q 11 cases and loss of 17p eight cases . Further recurrent
  copy number changes were detected. Extra copies of chromosome 7 were present in
  nine patients and gains of 1q were detected in six patients. A moderate genomic
  amplification was detected in one patient, involving two sites on 3p and the whole
  12p. Losses were more frequent, and especially involved the chromosomes 11 nine
  cases , 10q eight cases , 8 six cases , X six patients and 3 five cases , and part
  of chromosome 9 five cases . These recurrent chromosomal changes may highlight locations
  of novel genes with an important role in the development and or progression of PNET.
