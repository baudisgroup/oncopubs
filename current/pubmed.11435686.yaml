abstract: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans DFSP is a tumor of low or intermediate malignant
  potential with a tendency for recurrence, but low rate of metastasis. The tumorigenesis
  of DFSP has recently been shown to be associated with the fusion of the collagen
  type I alpha 1 COL1A1 and platelet-derived growth factor B-chain PDGFB genes, often
  as a consequence of translocation t 17 22 q22 q13 . Cytogenetically, DFSP is often
  characterized by supernumerary ring chromosomes containing material from chromosomes
  17 and 22. A subset of DFSPs undergo fibrosarcomatous transformation de novo or
  upon recurrence, and contain components indistinguishable from fibrosarcoma FS-DFSP
  . The fibrosarcomatous transformation appears to carry an increased risk for recurrence
  and metastasis, and is considered to represent tumor progression. The molecular
  cytogenetic events contributing to tumor progression are unknown. We used comparative
  genomic hybridization to analyze DNA copy number changes in 11 cases of typical
  DFSP and 10 cases of FS-DFSP. All cases in both groups were found to exhibit a gain
  or high-level amplification on chromosome 17q and the majority also on 22q. This
  finding is in line with previous studies, and suggests further that not only the
  COL1A1 PDGFB fusion gene formation but also the role of DNA copy number gains in
  the 17q and 22q regions is crucial per se in the pathogenesis of DFSP. Even though
  FS-DFSPs displayed a trend toward increase in the number of DNA copy number changes,
  the difference was not statistically significant, which indicates that mechanisms
  other than copy number changes are important in the transformation process of DFSP.
