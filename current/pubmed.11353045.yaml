abstract: Neoplasm of the vulva is a rare malignancy accounting for amp lt 5 of all
  female genital-tract cancer. However, in recent years the incidence of vulva intraepithelial
  neoplasia, known to serve as a precursor to carcinoma, has increased in young women
  generating considerable interest in its pathogenesis. Genetic changes at the molecular
  level in precursor or invasive vulvar tumors are not well investigated, and DNA
  copy number changes have not been reported until now. We used comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to analyze genetic alterations in 10 primary invasive squamous
  cell carcinomas of the vulva. Chromosomal aberrations were identified in 8 10 cases.
  The most frequent chromosomal losses were 4p13-pter five cases , 3p four cases ,
  and 5q two cases , and less frequent losses were detected at 6q, 11q, and 13q one
  case each . The most frequent chromosomal gains were 3q four cases and 8p three
  cases , and less frequent gains were found in 9p, 14, 17, and 20q one case each
  . The pattern of chromosomal imbalance in vulvar cancer detected by CGH was revealed
  to be very similar to that in cervical cancers, despite regional differences in
  their prevalence. These results suggest that the pathogenic pathways in vulvar and
  cervical carcinomas may be similar and that the genetic background may be common
  to these two squamous cell carcinomas.
