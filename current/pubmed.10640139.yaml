abstract: 'Ionizing radiation is a well-known risk factor for sarcoma development.
  To investigate whether radiation-associated sarcomas are characterized by chromosome
  aberrations that distinguish them from de novo sarcomas, we identified those patients
  in our series of more than 500 cytogenetically abnormal sarcomas that fulfilled
  the following criteria: 1 each patient should have been irradiated for another malignancy
  at least 3 years prior to the sarcoma diagnosis, and 2 the sarcoma should have developed
  within the field of radiation. Ten patients fulfilling these criteria could be retrieved
  median age at sarcoma diagnosis was 55 years, range 17-79 median latency period
  between primary tumor and radiation-associated sarcoma was 9 years, range 4-30 .
  The diagnoses were typical for radiation-associated sarcomas: 2 each of malignant
  fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, and pleomorphic sarcoma, and 1 each of osteosarcoma,
  fibrosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, and spindle cell sarcoma. All 10 cases had relatively
  complex karyotypes with multiple, mostly unbalanced, structural rearrangements,
  similar to what has been reported in de novo sarcomas of the corresponding histologic
  subtypes. The only cytogenetic features that were unusually frequent among the radiation-associated
  sarcomas were the finding of unrelated clones in 3 cases, and loss of material from
  chromosome arm 3p, in particular 3p21-3pter, in 8 cases. Loss of the same chromosome
  segment has been described in 4 of the 8 previously published cases of radiation-associated
  sarcomas that have been analyzed after short-term culturing, which makes this imbalance
  significantly P amp lt 0.001 more frequent among radiation-associated sarcomas 12
  of 18 cases than among unselected cases of the corresponding histologic subtypes
  74 of 282 cases . In contrast to the cytogenetic results, no 3p deletions were detected
  among the 6 cases of the present series that could be analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . The most frequent imbalance detected by CGH was gain of 15cen-q15
  3 cases , followed by loss of chromosome 13 and gain of 5p, and 7cen-q22, each detected
  in 2 cases.'
