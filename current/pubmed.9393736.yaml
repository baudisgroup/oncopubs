abstract: In an attempt to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with
  the metastatic phenotype, we investigated a total of 29 metastasizing pN and 19
  non-metastasizing pN0 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . The analysis indicated that the pN0 tumors carried preferentially
  overrepresentations of chromosomes 5p, 6p, and 7p and that the pN tumors were frequently
  characterized by deletions on chromosomes 7q, 10q, 11p, 11q, 15q, and 20p and overrepresentations
  of the chromosomes 19q and 20q. In particular, the use of difference histograms
  and statistical analysis indicated that the deletions on chromosomes 10q25-q26 and
  11p13-p14 were highly significant for metastasizing carcinomas. The findings on
  chromosome 10q were supported by loss of heterozygosity analysis in the primary
  tumors and eight synchronous lymph node metastases using four microsatellite polymorphisms.
  The data suggest that distinct patterns of genetic lesions are responsible for the
  metastatic phenotype of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
