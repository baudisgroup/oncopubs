abstract: 'Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most common neoplasms worldwide.
  Well-established risk factors include infections with two very different viruses:
  the DNA virus causing hepatitis B HBV and the RNA virus inducing hepatitis C HCV
  . In order to determine whether genetic differences exist between HBV- and HCV-induced
  HCC, 41 HCC samples of known vival status were examined by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . The analysis revealed frequent deletions of 1p 24 , 4q 39 , 6q 41 , 8p 44
  , 9p 24 , 11q 24 , 12q 22 , and 13q 39 , as well as common gains of 1q 46 , 6p 20
  , 8q 41 , 11q 27 , and 17q 37 . There was no significant difference in the number
  and type of chromosomal imbalances between 25 HCV- and 16 HBV-infected tumours.
  This is consistent with models suggesting that HBV and HCV cause cancer through
  non-specific inflammatory and regenerative processes, rather than through virus-specific
  interactions with defined target genes. Chromosomal imbalances were also unrelated
  to the grade and stage of HCC. This may suggest that most gross genomic alterations
  occur early during HCC development and that further progression of these tumours
  may be associated with other types of genetic changes, not detectable by CGH. In
  summary, these data show that characteristic gross genomic changes occur in HCC,
  but these alterations at present do not appear to have diagnostic or prognostic
  applications.'
