abstract: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) patients display heterogeneity
  in the clinical presentation and underlying genetic cause. The degree of inter-
  and intratumour genetic heterogeneity has not yet been defined.  In PPGLs from 94
  patients we analysed Loss of heterozygosity, copy number variations and mutation
  status of SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, VHL, EPAS1, NF1, RET, TMEM127, MAX and
  HRAS using high density SNP array and targeted deep sequencing respectively. Genetic
  heterogeneity were determined through (1) bioinformatics analysis of individual
  samples that estimated absolute purity and ploidy from SNP array data, and (2) comparison
  of paired tumour samples that allowed reconstruction of phylogenetic trees.  Mutations
  were found in 61% of the tumours and correlated to specific patterns of somatic
  copy number aberrations (SCNA) and degree of non-tumoural cell admixture. Intratumour
  genetic heterogeneity was observed in 74/136 of samples using absolute bioinformatics
  estimations and in 22/24 patients by comparison of paired samples. In addition a
  low genetic concordance was observed between paired primary tumours and distant
  metastases. This allowed for reconstructing the life history of individual tumours
  identifying somatic mutations as well as copy number loss of 3p and 11p (VHL subgroup),
  1p (Cluster 2) and 17q (NF1 subgroup) as early events in PPGL tumourigenesis.  Genomic
  landscapes of PPGL are specific to mutation subtype and characterized by genetic
  heterogeneity both within and between tumour lesions of the same patient.  Copyright
