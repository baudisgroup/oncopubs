abstract: High hyperdiploid (51-67 chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
  is one of the most common childhood malignancies, comprising 30% of all pediatric
  B cell-precursor ALL. Its characteristic genetic feature is the nonrandom gain of
  chromosomes X, 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18 and 21, with individual trisomies or tetrasomies
  being seen in over 75% of cases, but the pathogenesis remains poorly understood.
  We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (n = 16) and/or whole-exome sequencing
  (WES) (n = 39) of diagnostic and remission samples from 51 cases of high hyperdiploid
  ALL to further define the genomic landscape of this malignancy. The majority of
  cases showed involvement of the RTK-RAS pathway and of histone modifiers. No recurrent
  fusion gene-forming rearrangement was found, and an analysis of mutations on trisomic
  chromosomes indicated that the chromosomal gains were early events, strengthening
  the notion that the high hyperdiploid pattern is the main driver event in this common
  pediatric malignancy.
