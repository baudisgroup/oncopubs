abstract: About 50 of ductal breast carcinomas do not yield analysable karyotypes
  after short-term culturing. Comparison of the cytogenetic subset to the whole data
  set of tumors revealed that slightly hyperdiploid tumors, that is, with DNA index
  between 1.05 and 1.3, were under-represented in tumors for which cytogenetic analysis
  was successful. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the pattern of
  chromosome imbalances in this subset differs from that generally reported. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH was used on 43 primary ductal breast carcinomas selected
  for slight hyperdiploidy. Microsatellite instability MSI , TP53 mutation and expression
  were also investigated. All tumors were MSI negative. In all, 18 tumors 42 presented
  mostly unbalanced chromosome rearrangements and DNA amplifications, with only few
  or no whole chromosome gains WCG . This pattern of chromosome imbalances corresponds
  to that described in most breast tumors by previous cytogenetic and CGH analyses.
  It was associated with TP53 mutation in 17 of tumors. Another subset of 17 tumors
  39 displayed different and new features, characterized by recurrent gains of whole
  chromosomes 5, 7 and 8 with few chromosome rearrangements, rare DNA amplifications
  and no TP53 mutation. Eight tumors with as many rearrangements as WCG were left
  unclassified. We propose that, beside a major pathway characterized by multiple
  chromosome rearrangements, there is a minor pathway mainly characterized by WCG.
