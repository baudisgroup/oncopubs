abstract: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare, malignant liver tumor
  that often arises in the otherwise normal liver of adolescents and young adults.
  Previous studies have focused on biomarkers and comparisons to traditional hepatocellular
  carcinoma, and have yielded little data on the underlying pathophysiology. We performed
  whole genome sequencing on paired tumor and normal samples from 10 patients to identify
  recurrent mutations and structural variations that could predispose to oncogenesis.
  There are relatively few coding, somatic mutations in this cancer, putting it on
  the low end of the mutational spectrum. Aside from a previously described heterozygous
  deletion on chromosome 19 that encodes for a functional, chimeric protein, there
  were no other recurrent structural variations that contribute to the tumor genotype.
  The lack of a second-hit mutation in the genomic landscape of fibrolamellar hepatocellular
  carcinoma makes the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion protein the best target for diagnostic
  and therapeutic advancements. The mutations, altered pathways and structural variants
  that characterized fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma were distinct from those
  in hepatocellular carcinoma, further defining it as a distinct carcinoma.
