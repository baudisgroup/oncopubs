abstract: Copy number losses in chromosome arm 9p are well-known aberrations in malignancies,
  including leukemias. The CDKN2A gene is suggested to play a key role in these aberrations.
  In this study overviewing 9p losses in hematologic neoplasias, we introduce the
  term focal 9p instability to indicate multiple areas of copy number loss or homozygous
  loss within a larger heterozygous one in 9p. We have used microarray comparative
  genomic hybridization to study patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL, n
  140 , acute myeloid leukemia n 50 , chronic lymphocytic leukemia n 20 , and myelodysplastic
  syndromes n 37 . Our results show that 9p instability is restricted to ALL. In total,
  58 140 41 patients with ALL had a loss in 9p. The 9p instability was detected in
  19 of the patients with ALL and always included homozygous loss of CDKN2A along
  with loss of CDKN2B. Other possibly important genes included MTAP, IFN, MLLT3, JAK2,
  PTPLAD2, and PAX5. 13 27 48 patients with the instability had the BCR ABL1 fusion
  gene or other oncogene-activating translocation or structural aberrations. Two patients
  had homozygous loss of hsa-mir -31, a microRNA known to regulate IKZF1. IKZF1 deletion
  at 7p12.1 was seen in 10 37 patients with the 9p instability. These findings suggest
  that, in ALL leukemogenesis, loss of CDKN2A and other target genes in the instability
  region is frequently associated with BCR ABL1 and IKZF1 dysfunction. The multiple
  mechanisms leading to 9p instability including physical or epigenetic loss of the
  target genes, loss of the microRNA cluster, and the role of FRA9G fragile site are
  discussed.
