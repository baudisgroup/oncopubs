abstract: 'The prognostic relevance of chromosome 17 gain in neuroblastoma is still
  discussed. This investigation specifies the frequency, type, size, and transcriptional
  relevance in a large patient cohort. Primary tumor material of 202 patients was
  analyzed using high-resolution oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) and correlated with clinical and survival data. A subset (n = 145) was correlated
  for differentially expressed genes (DEG) by microarray analysis. Chromosome 17 aCGH
  analysis showed numerical gain in 94/202 patients (47%), partial gain in 93/202
  patients (46%), and no gain in 15/202 patients (7%). The frequency of partial gain
  was higher in stage 4 neuroblastoma (stage 1 15%; stage 2 12%; stage 3 16%; stage
  4S 7%; and stage 4 50%). Overall survival (OS) was superior in patients with numerical
  gain compared with patients with partial gain or no gain (5-y-OS: 0.95 ï¿½ 0.02
  vs. 0.63 ï¿½ 0.05 vs. 0.60 ï¿½ 0.13; P < 0.001). Gene expression analysis demonstrated
  95/130 DEGs between tumors with numerical or partial chromosome/no gain. Only one
  DEG (CCKBR) was detected comparing tumors with partial gain and those with no gain.
  In patients with partial gain, the distribution of breakpoints did not correlate
  with stage and 11q status, but with MYCN amplification and 1p status. The "best"
  breakpoints in cases with partial 17q gain were at 42.5 Mb for event-free and 26.6
  Mb for OS. Numerical gain of chromosome 17 is associated with a better prognosis
  than partial and no gain. The group of tumors with partial gain was similar to the
  group without gain with respect to stage distribution, outcome, and gene expression
  profile.  ï¿½ 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'
