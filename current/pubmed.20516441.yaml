abstract: Neuroblastoma is characterized by two distinct types of genetic profiles,
  consisting of either numerical or segmental chromosome alterations. The latter are
  associated with a higher risk of relapse, even when occurring together with numerical
  alterations. We explored the role of segmental alterations in tumor progression
  and the possibility of evolution from indolent to aggressive genomic types.
