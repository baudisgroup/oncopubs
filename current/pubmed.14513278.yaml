abstract: According to the 1999 World Health Organisation classification of lung tumors,
  the classification of neuroendocrine NE tumors is solely based on light-microscopic
  features. Typical and atypical carcinoid tumors are distinguished from large cell
  LCNEC and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas SCLC . We used comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH on 50 samples to investigate the cytogenetic relationships between
  NE tumors. On average, carcinoid tumors showed markedly fewer chromosomal imbalances
  1.8 case, 23 cases than LCNEC 13.3 case, 17 cases or SCLC 17 case, 10 cases . The
  frequency of amplicons increased accordingly. Typical carcinoid tumors exhibited
  significant defects on chromosomes 11 and 13 only. Interestingly, only the frequency
  of losses on chromosome arm 11q was very similar for all three tumor entities about
  30 . In conclusion, the CGH results support the classification of typical carcinoid
  tumors as a separate entity in clear distinction from the NE carcinomas.
