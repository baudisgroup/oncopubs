abstract: 'We sought to assess whether genetic abnormalities in hepatocellular carcinoma
  differed in geographic locations associated with different risk factors. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH was applied to the genome-wide chromosomal analysis in
  83 tumor samples from four different geographic origins. Samples were obtained from
  regions that differed in aflatoxin exposure: China Hong Kong with low aflatoxin
  exposure and Shanghai with moderate aflatoxin exposure , Japan, and the United States
  negligible aflatoxin exposure . Cases from Hong Kong and Shanghai were all hepatitis
  B virus HBV related, those from Japan were hepatitis C virus related, and those
  from the United States were HBV negative. In parallel, the mutational pattern of
  the whole p53 gene exons 1-11 was also investigated in these cases. CGH revealed
  a complex pattern of chromosomal gains and losses, with the commonest aberration
  in each geographic location being chromosome 1q copy number gain 38-60 . Shanghai
  cases displayed the highest number of total aberrations per sample, with significant
  copy losses on 4q 75 , 8p 70 , and 16q 65 . Hepatitis C virus-related samples from
  Japan had a characteristically high incidence of 11q13 gain. p53 mutation s was
  detected in 23 of Hong Kong cases, 40 of Shanghai, 31 of Japan, but only 6 of the
  United States cases. The amp quot aflatoxin-associated amp quot codon 249 mutation
  was, however, identified only in samples from China 13 Hong Kong and 20 Shanghai
  . This finding, together with the highly aberrant pattern of genetic changes detected
  in the Shanghai series, is suggestive of the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin being
  more broadly based. It is also likely that there is a synergistic effect of HBV
  infection and high aflatoxin exposure in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma development.
  It appears from our CGH study that individual risk factors are indeed associated
  with distinct genetic aberrations, although changes in 1q gain appear common to
  all.'
