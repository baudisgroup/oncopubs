abstract: Runt-related transcription factor 3 RUNX3 is a candidate tumor suppressor
  gene, localized on 1p36, involved in TGF-beta-Smads signaling. To assess its role
  in liver fluke-associated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ICC , the promoter methylation
  status was investigated in 53 ICCs by methylation-specific PCR, with determination
  of loss of 1p36.1 by microarray comparative genomic hybridization and RUNX3 protein
  expression by immunohistochemistry. Loss at 1p36.1 was found 41.5 of ICCs 22 53
  . In addition, DNA hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter was found in 49.1 26 53
  of cancers and 57.1 4 7 of ICC cell lines. The protein was highly expressed in normal
  bile ducts but mostly decreased in ICCs, 67.9 n 36 being negative for immunohistochemical
  staining. Promoter hypermethylation of RUNX3 was associated with reversible decrease
  or absence of RUNX3 protein expression p amp lt 0.001 , but this was not found to
  differ with the ICC subtype. In contrast, loss of 1p36.1 demonstrated a significant
  link p 0.020 . In conclusion, RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation and loss of 1p36.1
  are causal mechanisms for loss of RUNX3 function in liver fluke-associated ICC carcinogenesis.
