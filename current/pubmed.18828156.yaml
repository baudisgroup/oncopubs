abstract: 'Follicular lymphoma FL is characterized by a large number of chromosomal
  aberrations. However, their exact genomic extension and involved target genes remain
  to be determined. For this purpose, we used array-based intermediate-high resolution
  genomic profiling in combination with Affymetrix gene expression analysis. Tumor
  specimens from 128 FL patients were analyzed for the presence of genomic aberrations
  and the results were correlated to clinical data sets and mRNA expression levels.
  In 114 89 of the 128 analyzed cases, a total of 688 genomic aberrations 384 gains
  amplifications and 304 losses were detected. Frequent genomic aberrations were:
  -1p36 18 , 2p15 24 , -3q 14 , -6q 25 , 7p 19 , 7q 23 , 8q 14 , -9p 16 , -11q 15
  , 12q 20 , -13q 11 , -17p 16 , 18p 18 , and 18q 28 . Critical segments of these
  imbalances were delineated to genomic fragments with a minimum size down to 0.2
  Mb. By comparison of these with mRNA gene expression data, putative candidate genes
  were identified. Moreover, we found that deletions affecting the tumor suppressor
  gene CDKN2A B on 9p21 were detected in nontransformed FL grade I-II. For this aberration
  as well as for -6q25 and -6q26, an association with inferior survival was observed.'
