abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to screen 54 advanced colon
  carcinomas. i.e., 24 primary tumors and 30 metastases, for chromosomal alterations.
  Using a sensitive statistical method for the determination of DNA imbalances and
  histograms for analysis of the incidence of changes, we identified the DNA over-representation
  of chromosome 20q as the most common alteration being present in 100 of cases. High
  incidence deletions were observed on 18q21-18q23 96 , 4q27-4q28 96 , 4p14 87 , 5q21
  81 , 1p21-1p22 72 , 21q21 74 , 6q16 72 , 3p12 66 , 8p24-8p21 66 , 9p21 64 , 11q22
  64 , and 14q13-14q21 64 . Further frequent over-representation was found on 7q12-7q11.2
  75 , 16p11-16p12 70 , 19p13 70 , 9q34 67 , 19q13 67 , 13q34 64 , 13q13 64 , 17q21
  59 , 22q11 61 , 8q24 57 , and 1q21 57 . Pronounced DNA gains and losses being defined
  as regions in which the ratio profiles exceeded the values of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively,
  frequently colocalized with peaks of incidence curve. The use of difference histograms
  for the comparison of tumor subgroups as well as case-by-case histogram for the
  analysis of 15 paired tumor samples identified several of the above alterations
  as relevant for tumor progression and metastasis formation. The study identified
  additional loci and delineates more precisely those that have been previously reported.
  For comparative purposes, we have made our primary data ratio profiles, clinicopathological
  parameters, histograms available at the interactive web site http: amba.charite.de
  cgh, where the incidence of changes can be determined at individual loci and additional
  parameters can be applied for the analysis of our CGH results.'
