abstract: The histopathology of papillary tumours of the pineal region PTPR closely
  resembles that of ependymomas and choroid plexus tumours. Therefore, immunohistochemical
  staining profiles were investigated in a series of 15 PTPR. In addition to cytokeratin,
  synaptophysin and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, PTPR were examined
  for the presence of dot- or ring-like epithelial membrane antigen EMA immunoreactivity
  typically encountered in ependymoma, staining for inwardly rectifying potassium
  channel Kir7.1 and stanniocalcin-1 specifically expressed in choroid plexus tumours
  as well as microtubule-associated protein-2 MAP-2 . Furthermore, comparative genomic
  hybridization was performed in five PTPR. Cytokeratin was expressed in all PTPR
  examined, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein and synaptophysin staining were
  absent. Dot- or ring-like EMA immunoreactivity was only observed in 1 out of 15
  PTPR. Membranous Kir7.1 and cytoplasmic stanniocalcin-1 staining were present in
  the minority of PTPR 3 15 and 4 15, respectively . In contrast, MAP-2 immunoreactivity
  was encountered in 13 out of 15 PTPR, but was significantly less frequently observed
  in a series of choroid plexus tumours 7 37 . PTPR mainly presented with chromosomal
  losses affecting chromosomes 10 4 5 cases and 22q 3 5 cases as well as gains on
  chromosomes 4 4 5 cases , 8 3 5 cases , 9 3 5 cases and 12 3 5 cases . To conclude,
  the majority of PTPR can be distinguished from ependymomas and choroid plexus tumours
  by absent staining for epithelial membrane antigen, Kir7.1 and staniocalcin-1 as
  well as the presence of distinct MAP-2 immunoreactivity. Antibodies directed against
  these antigens are thus expected to be valuable markers in the diagnosis of papillary
  tumours located in the vicinity of the third ventricle.
