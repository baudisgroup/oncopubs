abstract: Human papilloma virus HPV infection is the crucial step in the initiation
  of cervical carcinomas. In addition, HPV18 has been implicated in tumour progression
  and adverse clinical outcome. We determined the HPV types in 12 primary cervical
  carcinomas and 12 cell lines and compared the findings with the comparative genetic
  hybridisation CGH pattern of chromosomal alterations. The most frequent alteration
  was the deletion at 3p14 followed by the loss of 2q34-q36 along with 3q gain. High
  risk HPV types were detected in all samples except one primary tumour. In contrast
  to the normal distribution, HPV18 was present in 75 of cases including all cell
  lines. The cell lines carried a higher number of genetic alterations and a different
  CGH pattern for several chromosomes than the primary tumours, despite microdissection.
  Purely HPV18 positive cases indicated a high incidence of imbalances at specific
  loci with peaks of the histogram coinciding with known HPV integration sites. The
  study suggests that HPV infection is associated with a recurrent pattern of chromosomal
  changes in cervical carcinomas and that the development and progression of these
  alterations is triggered by integration into the host genome.
