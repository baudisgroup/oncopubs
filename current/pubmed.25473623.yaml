abstract: We have identified a novel 7.7ï¿½Mb del(8)(q23.2q24.11) in a patient progressing
  to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following a 12-year stable phase of chronic myelomonocytic
  leukemia (CMML). A surprisingly high JAK2+ allelic burden of 92% at the time of
  AML led us to delineate the molecular aberrations relevant for leukemogenesis. While
  a frameshift mutation in the TET2 gene was stably present throughout the course
  of disease the JAK2 mutation was acquired after initial diagnosis of CMML. At progression
  aCGH revealed del(8q)(q23.2q24.11) encompassing various cancer relevant genes of
  which RAD21 and CSMD3 are of particular interest.
