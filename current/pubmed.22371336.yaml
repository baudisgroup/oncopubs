abstract: 'Despite recent advances in the identification of the cytogenetic profiles
  of meningiomas, a significant group of tumors still show normal karyotypes or few
  chromosomal changes. The authors analyzed the cytogenetic profile of 50 meningiomas
  using fluorescence in situ hybridization and high-density 500 K single nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP arrays. Our results confirm that del 22q 52 and del 1p 16 common
  deleted regions: 22q11.21-22q13.3. and 1p31.2-p36.33 are the most frequent alterations.
  Additionally, recurrent monosomy 14 8 , del 6q 10 , del 7p 10 , and del 19q 4 were
  observed, while copy number patterns consistent with recurrent chromosomal gains,
  gene amplification, and copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity cnLOH were either
  absent or rare. Based on their overall SNP profiles, meningiomas could be classified
  into: i diploid cases, ii meningiomas with a single chromosomal change e.g., monosomy
  22 del 22q and iii tumors with 2 altered chromosomes. In summary, our results confirm
  and extend on previous observations showing that the most recurrent chromosomal
  abnormalities in meningiomas correspond to chromosome losses localized in chromosomes
  1, 22 and less frequently in chromosomes 6, 7, 14, and 19, while chromosomal gains
  and cnLOH are restricted to a small proportion of cases. Finally, a set of cancer-associated
  candidate genes associated with the TP53, MYC, CASP3, HDAC1, and TERT signaling
  pathways was identified, in cases with coexisting monosomy 14 and del 1p .'
