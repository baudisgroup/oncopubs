abstract: The tumor microenvironment strongly influences cancer development, progression,
  and metastasis. The role of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts CAFs in these processes
  and their clinical impact has not been studied systematically in non-small cell
  lung carcinoma NSCLC . We established primary cultures of CAFs and matched normal
  fibroblasts NFs from 15 resected NSCLC. We demonstrate that CAFs have greater ability
  than NFs to enhance the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cell lines. Microarray gene-expression
  analysis of the 15 matched CAF and NF cell lines identified 46 differentially expressed
  genes, encoding for proteins that are significantly enriched for extracellular proteins
  regulated by the TGF- signaling pathway. We have identified a subset of 11 genes
  13 probe sets that formed a prognostic gene-expression signature, which was validated
  in multiple independent NSCLC microarray datasets. Functional annotation using protein-protein
  interaction analyses of these and published cancer stroma-associated gene-expression
  changes revealed prominent involvement of the focal adhesion and MAPK signaling
  pathways. Fourteen 30 of the 46 genes also were differentially expressed in laser-capture-microdissected
  corresponding primary tumor stroma compared with the matched normal lung. Six of
  these 14 genes could be induced by TGF- 1 in NF. The results establish the prognostic
  impact of CAF-associated gene-expression changes in NSCLC patients.
