abstract: The molecular characteristics and the clinical disease course of bladder
  cancer BC in young patients remain largely unresolved. All patients are monitored
  according to an intensive surveillance protocol and we aim to gain more insight
  into the molecular pathways of bladder tumors in young patients that could ultimately
  contribute to patient stratification, improve patient quality of life and reduce
  associated costs. We also determined whether a biomarker-based surveillance could
  be feasible.
