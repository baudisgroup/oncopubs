abstract: Progression of primary prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate
  cancer (CRPC) is associated with numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations that
  are thought to promote survival at metastatic sites. In this study, we investigated
  gene copy number and CpG methylation status in CRPC to gain insight into specific
  pathophysiologic pathways that are active in this advanced form of prostate cancer.
  Our analysis defined and validated 495 genes exhibiting significant differences
  in CRPC in gene copy number, including gains in androgen receptor (AR) and losses
  of PTEN and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Significant copy number differences existed
  between tumors with or without AR gene amplification, including a common loss of
  AR repressors in AR-unamplified tumors. Simultaneous gene methylation and allelic
  deletion occurred frequently in RB1 and HSD17B2, the latter of which is involved
  in testosterone metabolism. Lastly, genomic DNA from most CRPC was hypermethylated
  compared with benign prostate tissue. Our findings establish a comprehensive methylation
  signature that couples epigenomic and structural analyses, thereby offering insights
  into the genomic alterations in CRPC that are associated with a circumvention of
  hormonal therapy. Genes identified in this integrated genomic study point to new
  drug targets in CRPC, an incurable disease state which remains the chief therapeutic
  challenge.
