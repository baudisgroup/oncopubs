abstract: Four cases of late onset clear cell renal cell carcinoma RCC , a case of
  gastric cancer, and a case of exocrine pancreatic cancer were identified in a Japanese
  family. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanism for tumorigenesis in this
  family, extensive genetic studies were performed including routine and spectral
  karyotyping SKY , fluorescence in situ hybridisation FISH , comparative genomic
  hybridisation CGH , loss of heterozygosity studies LOH , and VHL mutation analysis.
  A germline translocation t 1 3 q32-q41 q13-q21 was identified by karyotyping in
  five members of the family including all three RCC cases tested. The translocation
  was refined to t 1 3 q32 q13.3 by FISH analysis using locus specific genomic clones,
  and the two breakpoints were mapped to a 5 cM region in 3q13.3 and a 3.6 cM region
  in 1q32. Both CGH and allelotyping using microsatellite markers showed loss of the
  derivative chromosome 3 carrying a 1q segment in the three familial RCCs analysed.
  Additional chromosomal imbalances were identified by CGH, including amplifications
  of chromosomes 5 and 7 and loss of 8p and 9. No germline VHL mutation was found
  but two different somatic mutations, a splice IVS1-2A amp gt C and a frameshift
  726delG , were identified in two RCCs from the same patient confirming their distinct
  origin. Taken together, these results firmly support a three step model for tumorigenesis
  in this family. A constitutional translocation t 1q 3q increased the susceptibility
  to loss of the derivative chromosome 3 which is then followed by somatic mutations
  of the RCC related tumour suppressor gene VHL located in the remaining copy of chromosome
  3.
