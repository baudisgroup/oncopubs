abstract: A characteristic of human gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors GEP-NET
  is a minute unobtrusive primary tumor which often cannot be detected by common physical
  examinations. It therefore remains unidentified until the tumor has spread and space-occupying
  metastases cause clinical symptoms leading to diagnosis. Cases in which the primary
  cannot be located are referred to as NET with CUP-syndrome cancer of unknown primary
  syndrome . With the help of array-CGH comparative genomic hybridization, Agilent
  105K and gene expression analysis Agilent 44K , microdissected primaries and their
  metastases were compared to identify up- and down-regulated genes which can be used
  as a marker for tumor progression. In a next analysis step, a hierarchical clustering
  of 41.078 genes revealed three genes C-type lectin domain family 13 member A CD302
  , peptidylprolyl isomerase containing WD40 repeat PPWD1 and abhydrolase domain containing
  14B ABHD14B which expression levels can categorize the metastases into three groups
  depending on the localization of their primary. Because cancer therapy is dependent
  on the localization of the primary, the gene expression level of these three genes
  are promising markers to unravel the CUP syndrome in NET.
