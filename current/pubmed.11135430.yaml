abstract: In order to identify genomic changes associated with an etoposide resistance
  acquisition, we used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to compare a human lung
  adenocarcinoma cell line, A549 wild type, and three sublines, A549-VP1-3, exposed
  to increasing concentrations of the topoisomerase II inhibitor, VP16. R-banding
  karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , and Southern blot for the MLL
  gene were also performed. The CGH analysis showed that the A549-VP3 cell line shared
  chemoresistance-specific abnormalities amplification of 11q23-qter, loss of chromosome
  17, and deletions of 2p14-pter and 2q23-q24 . FISH analysis confirmed the loss of
  one chromosome 17 in the three resistant sublines and revealed an increased fragmentation
  of chromosome 2 in more than two segments, depending on the etoposide concentration.
  FISH with an MLL gene probe showed additional signals of MLL from three in the A549-WT
  to seven in the A549-VP3 cell line translocated onto several other chromosomes.
  Southern blot indicated an amplification of the MLL gene, dependent on the etoposide
  concentration, without gene rearrangement. The CGH results are suggestive of loci
  that could be associated with the acquisition of an etoposide-chemoresistant phenotype.
  Deletion of the 2p region has already been reported, without any candidate gene
  being identified. The role of MLL in leukemogenesis has previously been demonstrated,
  but its role in the development of other tumors or its significance in the chemoresistance
  process remains to be elucidated.
