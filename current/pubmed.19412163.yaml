abstract: A20 is a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway and was initially identified
  as being rapidly induced after tumour-necrosis factor-alpha stimulation. It has
  a pivotal role in regulation of the immune response and prevents excessive activation
  of NF-kappaB in response to a variety of external stimuli recent genetic studies
  have disclosed putative associations of polymorphic A20 also called TNFAIP3 alleles
  with autoimmune disease risk. However, the involvement of A20 in the development
  of human cancers is unknown. Here we show, using a genome-wide analysis of genetic
  lesions in 238 B-cell lymphomas, that A20 is a common genetic target in B-lineage
  lymphomas. A20 is frequently inactivated by somatic mutations and or deletions in
  mucosa-associated tissue lymphoma 18 out of 87 21.8 and Hodgkins lymphoma of nodular
  sclerosis histology 5 out of 15 33.3 , and, to a lesser extent, in other B-lineage
  lymphomas. When re-expressed in a lymphoma-derived cell line with no functional
  A20 alleles, wild-type A20, but not mutant A20, resulted in suppression of cell
  growth and induction of apoptosis, accompanied by downregulation of NF-kappaB activation.
  The A20-deficient cells stably generated tumours in immunodeficient mice, whereas
  the tumorigenicity was effectively suppressed by re-expression of A20. In A20-deficient
  cells, suppression of both cell growth and NF-kappaB activity due to re-expression
  of A20 depended, at least partly, on cell-surface-receptor signalling, including
  the tumour-necrosis factor receptor. Considering the physiological function of A20
  in the negative modulation of NF-kappaB activation induced by multiple upstream
  stimuli, our findings indicate that uncontrolled signalling of NF-kappaB caused
  by loss of A20 function is involved in the pathogenesis of subsets of B-lineage
  lymphomas.
