abstract: We report three patients with normal karyotype (NK) ALL, who showed genetic
  aberrations as determined by high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array
  (SNP-A) analysis at both diagnosis and relapse. We evaluated the clinical relevance
  of the SNP-A assay for the detection of subtle changes in the size of affected genetic
  lesions at relapse as well as the prognostic value of the assay. In our patients,
  application of the SNP-A assay enabled sensitive detection of cryptic changes affecting
  clinically important genes in NK ALL. Therefore, this assay seems to be more advantageous
  compared to other conventional methods such as FISH assay, HemaVision (DNA Technology,
  Denmark), and conventional karyotyping for the detection of an "unstable genotype"
  at relapse, which may be associated with microscopic clonal evolution and poor prognosis.
  Further comprehensive studies are required to confirm the issues presented by our
  case patients in this report.
