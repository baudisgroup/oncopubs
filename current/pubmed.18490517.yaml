abstract: Despite advances in the curative treatment of acute myeloid leukemia AML
  , recurrence will occur in the majority of cases. At diagnosis, acquisition of segmental
  uniparental disomy UPD by mitotic recombination has been reported in 15 to 20 of
  AML cases, associated with homozygous mutations in the region of loss of heterozygosity.
  This study aimed to discover if clonal evolution from heterozygous to homozygous
  mutations by mitotic recombination provides a mechanism for relapse. DNA from 27
  paired diagnostic and relapsed AML samples were analyzed using genotyping arrays.
  Newly acquired segmental UPDs were observed at relapse in 11 AML samples 40 . Six
  were segmental UPDs of chromosome 13q, which were shown to lead to a change from
  heterozygosity to homozygosity for internal tandem duplication mutation of FLT3
  FLT3 ITD . Three further AML samples had evidence of acquired segmental UPD of 13q
  in a subclone of the relapsed leukemia. One patient acquired segmental UPD of 19q
  that led to homozygosity for a CEBPA mutation 207C amp gt T. Finally, a single patient
  with AML acquired segmental UPD of chromosome 4q, for which the candidate gene is
  unknown. We conclude that acquisition of segmental UPD and the resulting homozygous
  mutation is a common event associated with relapse of AML.
