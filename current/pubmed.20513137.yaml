abstract: In 5-10 of patients, neurofibromatosis type 1 NF1 results from microdeletions
  that encompass the entire NF1 gene and a variable number of flanking genes. Two
  recurrent microdeletion types are found in most cases, with microdeletion breakpoints
  located in paralogous regions flanking NF1 proximal NF1-REP-a and distal NF1-REP-c
  for the 1.4 Mb type-1 microdeletion, and SUZ12 and SUZ12P for the 1.2 Mb type-2
  microdeletion . A more severe phenotype is usually associated with NF1 microdeletion
  patients than in those with intragenic mutations. We characterized NF1 microdeletions
  in 70 unrelated NF1 microdeleted patients using a high-resolution NF1 custom array
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied
  in 58 of these microdeletion patients and compared to 389 patients with intragenic
  truncating NF1 mutations and phenotyped in the same standardized way. Our results
  confirmed in an unbiased manner the existence of a contiguous gene syndrome with
  a significantly higher incidence of learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism
  in microdeleted patients compared to patients with intragenic NF1 mutations. Microdeleted
  NF1 patients also showed a trend toward significance for childhood overgrowth. High-resolution
  array-CGH identified a new recurrent approximately 1.0 Mb microdeletion type, designated
  as type-3, with breakpoints in the paralogous regions middle NF1-REP-b and distal
  NF1-REP-c.
