abstract: 'OVARIAN CARCINOMAS CONSIST OF AT LEAST FIVE DISTINCT DISEASES: high-grade
  serous, low-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous. Biomarker and
  molecular characterization may represent a more biologically relevant basis for
  grouping and treating this family of tumors, rather than site of origin. Molecular
  characteristics have become the new standard for clinical pathology, however development
  of tailored type-specific therapies is hampered by a failure of basic research to
  recognize that model systems used to study these diseases must also be stratified.
  Unrelated model systems do offer value for study of biochemical processes but specific
  cellular context needs to be applied to assess relevant therapeutic strategies.  We
  have focused on the identification of clear cell carcinoma cell line models. A panel
  of 32 "ovarian cancer" cell lines has been classified into histotypes using a combination
  of mutation profiles, IHC mutation-surrogates, and a validated immunohistochemical
  model. All cell lines were identity verified using STR analysis.  Many described
  ovarian clear cell lines have characteristic mutations (including ARID1A and PIK3CA)
  and an overall molecular/immuno-profile typical of primary tumors. Mutations in
  TP53 were present in the majority of high-grade serous cell lines. Advanced genomic
  analysis of bona-fide clear cell carcinoma cell lines also support copy number changes
  in typical biomarkers such at MET and HNF1B and a lack of any recurrent expressed
  re-arrangements.  As with primary ovarian tumors, mutation status of cancer genes
  like ARID1A and TP53 and a general immuno-profile serve well for establishing histotype
  of ovarian cancer cell We describe specific biomarkers and molecular features to
  re-classify generic "ovarian carcinoma" cell lines into type specific categories.
  Our data supports the use of prototype clear cell lines, such as TOV21G and JHOC-5,
  and questions the use of SKOV3 and A2780 as models of high-grade serous carcinoma.'
