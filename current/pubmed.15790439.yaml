abstract: Patients with stage I granulosa cell tumors GCTs may occasionally develop
  metastasis, which is hard to predict using pathologic criteria. It is interesting
  to elucidate whether certain chromosomal imbalances CIs , detected by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , could be useful prognostic markers.
