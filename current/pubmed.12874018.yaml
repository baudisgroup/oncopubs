abstract: Genomic amplification can lead to the activation of cellular proto-oncogenes
  during tumorigenesis, and is observed in most, if not all, human malignancies, including
  adenocarcinomas of lung and esophagus. Using a two-dimensional restriction landmark
  genomic scanning technique, we identified five NotI HinfI fragments with increased
  genomic dosage in an adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction. Four of these
  amplified fragments were matched within three contigs of chromosome 12 using the
  bioinformatics tool, Virtual Genome Scan. All three of the contigs map to the 12q13-q14
  region, and the regional amplification in the tumor was verified using comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis. The 12q14 amplicon was characterized using sequence
  tagged site-amplification mapping with DNA from paired normal-tumor tissues of 75
  gastroesophageal and 37 lung adenocarcinomas. The amplicon spans a region of amp
  gt 12 Mb between genes DGKA and BLOV1. The core-amplified domain was determined
  to be amp lt 0.5 Mb between marker WI-12457 and gene IFNG. However, MDM2, a well-documented
  oncogene of the region, is outside the core-domain. Eleven genes and expressed sequence
  tags within the amplicon were selected for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR,
  and DYRK2, a member of the dual-specificity kinase family, was overexpressed in
  all of the tumors showing gene amplification. Among the sequence tagged site expressed
  sequence tag gene markers tested, DYRK2 demonstrated the highest DNA copy number
  and the highest level of mRNA overexpression in the tumors. Moreover, DYRK2 mRNA
  overexpression amp gt 2.5-fold of normal mean was found in 18.6 of additional 86
  lung adenocarcinomas in an assay using oligonucleotide microarrays. DYRK2 mRNA overexpression
  occurs more frequently than gene amplification in both esophageal and lung adenocarcinomas.
  This is the first report of amplification and overexpression of DYRK2 in any tumor
  type.
