abstract: The classical follicular variant of follicle center lymphoma FCL-fo is associated
  with the chromosomal translocation t 14 18 q32 q21 . However, the sole presence
  of this translocation is not sufficient for malignant transformation, as demonstrated
  by experiments in a transgenic mouse model. Most of the secondary changes, which
  play a central role in tumor development and progression and which are presumed
  to be of prognostic value, are gains and losses of chromosomal material. We analyzed
  28 FCL-fo patients using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The most frequent
  imbalances were gains on chromosomes X, 7, 8, 12, and 18 as well as losses of material
  on chromosome arm 6q. For chromosomes X, 8, 12, and 18, the CGH data allowed further
  narrowing of the relevant subregions. In addition, novel high-level DNA amplifications
  were identified in five instances mapping to chromosome bands 1p36, 6p21, 8q24 2
  patients , and 12q13-14. Previously, such amplifications have been identified very
  rarely in lymphomas. In the 2 patients with amplifications mapping to chromosomal
  band 8q24, involvement of the MYC proto-oncogene in the amplification unit was demonstrated
  by Southern blot analysis. These data provide further entry points for studies to
  identify genes relevant for tumor progression in FCL-fo.
