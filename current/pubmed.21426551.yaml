abstract: DNA methylation in the SHOX2 locus was previously used to reliably detect
  lung cancer in a group of critical controls, including cytologically negative samples
  with no visible tumor cell content, at a high specificity based on the analysis
  of bronchial lavage samples. This study aimed to investigate, if the methylation
  correlates with SHOX2 gene expression and or copy number alterations. An amplification
  of the SHOX2 gene locus together with the observed tumor-specific hypermethylation
  might explain the good performance of this marker in bronchial lavage samples.
