abstract: Available clinical, radiological and histopathologic risk factors are not
  adequate for accurate prognosis in uterine cervix carcinoma. Hence there is a need
  to identify indicators to select high risk cases. Most cancers occur and progress
  through step-wise somatic genetic mutations. Thus screening of whole genome for
  specific genomic alterations and its outcome following treatment may predict prognosis.
  The present study was carried out to investigate genomic alterations associated
  with cervical carcinoma and any association of genomic alterations with clinico-pathologic
  parameters.
