abstract: Twenty-two primary central nervous system lymphomas of immunocompetent adults
  were studied by comparative genomic hybridization. All were high-grade diffuse large
  B cell lymphomas. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed an average of 5.5 chromosomal
  changes per tumor, with gains being more common than losses 3.5 vs. 2.0 . The most
  frequent DNA copy number changes were gains on chromosomes 1, 12, 18 41 each , 7
  23 , and 11 18 and losses involving chromosomes 6 59 , 18, and 20 18 each . Commonly
  involved regions were 12q 41 , 18q 36 , 1q 32 , and 7q 23 , as well as -6q 50 ,
  -6p 18 , -17p, and -18p 14 each . High-level gains were found on 7 chromosomes,
  mainly involving chromosomes 18q 23 , 12q 18 , and 1q 14 . Minimal common regions
  of over- and underrepresentation were found on 1q25-31, -6q16-21, 7q11.2, 12p11.2-13,
  12q12-14, 12q22-24.1, and 18q12.2-21.3. A significant correlation between loss of
  DNA copy numbers on chromosome 6q and shorter survival could be established 10.2
  vs. 22.3 months P amp lt 0.05 . Our findings suggest that chromosomal imbalances
  of primary central nervous system lymphomas are similar to those of diffuse large
  B cell lymphomas at other locations and are probably not related to cerebral presentation
  however, they may be prognostically relevant.
