abstract: Natural killer and natural killer-like T cell lymphomas represent a rare
  type of non-Hodgkins lymphoma originally described to involve the upper aerodigestive
  tract. This malignancy has been increasingly observed in other extranodal sites,
  particularly in the skin. Patients with cutaneous natural killer cell lymphoma generally
  have a poor prognosis however, the etiology and the underlying molecular pathogenesis
  remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate comprehensively genomic changes
  in blastic natural killer and extranodal natural killer-like T cell lymphoma with
  cutaneous involvement. Comparative genomic hybridization showed chromosome imbalances
  in six of eight cases studied 75 . The mean number of chromosome imbalances per
  sample was 2.18 -1.63 with similar number of gains 1.18 -1.17 and losses 1.00 -1.34
  . The most frequent DNA copy number changes observed were losses of 9 9p 83 , followed
  by loss of 13q and gain of 7 67 . Similar patterns of chromosome imbalances were
  observed in both blastic natural killer and cutaneous natural killer-like T cell
  lymphomas. Loss of the RB1 gene at 13q14.2 was detected in one blastic natural killer
  cell lymphoma with 13q loss using a gene dosage assay, and in one cutaneous natural
  killer-like T cell lymphoma without 13q loss using fluorescent in situ hybridization.
  Genomic microarray analysis identified oncogene copy number gains of PAK1 and JUNB
  in three of four cases studied, and gains of RAF1, CTSB, FGFR1, and BCR in two cases.
  Real-time polymerase chain reaction detected amplification of CTSB and RAF1 in four
  of five cases analyzed, JUNB and MYCN in three cases, and REL and YES1 in two cases,
  respectively. In conjunction with this study, an extensive literature search for
  the published G-banded karyotypes of four subsets of natural killer cell lymphomas
  was conducted, which showed a nonrandom pattern of multiple chromosome aberrations.
  These results reveal consistent genetic alterations in cutaneous natural killer
  cell lymphomas, and provide a basis for further investigation of molecular pathogenesis
  in this malignancy.
