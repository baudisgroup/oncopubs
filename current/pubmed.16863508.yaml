abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine genetic alterations occur during
  synchronous or metachronous multifocal development of urothelial cancers on the
  whole genome using a comparative genomic hybridization CGH array. We used 10 tumor
  pairs 2 tumors for each patient , in which we had previously defined a clonal relationship
  by microsatellite analysis. For CGH array analysis, Vysis GenoSensor Array 300 kit
  was used. An unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the tumors
  from one patient were clustered together independent of the tumors of all other
  patients. On the other hand, many genetic divergences among multifocal urothelial
  cancers were newly found by a CGH array analysis. The concordant genetic alteration
  patterns of the chromosomal arm in tumor pairs were most frequently observed in
  9p, 9q, 8p, 7p, 7q and 11q, while discordant patterns were most frequently found
  in 15q, 20q, 2q, 10p and 11q. Investigation using a CGH array showed that genetically
  stable multifocal tumors were less frequent, and that a large percentage of urothelial
  cancers accumulate genetic alterations during multifocal development by clonal evolution.
  We might have to consider these genetic accumulations during multifocal development
  when designing strategies for prevention and detection of recurrent multifocal urothelial
  cancers. CGH array can be a powerful tool for genetic analysis of multifocal urothelial
  cancer.
