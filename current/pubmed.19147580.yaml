abstract: Cervical cancer develops from precancerous high-grade cervical intraepithelial
  neoplasia CIN harboring a transforming infection with high-risk human papillomavirus,
  which is characterized by p16 INK4a overexpression. Once such a lesion has developed,
  progression toward an invasive squamous cell carcinoma SCC may take one or more
  decades, underlining the heterogeneity of these lesions in terms of duration of
  existence and progression risk. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array CGH on 46 p16 INK4a immunopositive CIN2 3 lesions to determine whether this
  heterogeneity is reflected in their chromosomal profiles. Chromosomal profiles of
  CIN2 3 lesions were related to those of invasive cervical SCC and promoter methylation
  of CADM1, a tumor suppressor gene known to be functionally involved in the tumorigenic
  phenotype of cervical cancer cells. Frequent alterations found in CIN2 3 lesions
  included gains located at chromosome 1, 3, 7, and 20 and losses located at 4, 11,
  16, 17, and 19. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two subsets of CIN2
  3 lesions, chromosomal profiles of one of which closely resembled invasive SCCs.
  Gains of 1, 3q, and 20 were characteristic for CIN2 3 lesions with chromosomal signatures
  resembling carcinomas. In addition, dense promoter methylation of the CADM1 gene
  was significantly more frequent in these CIN2 3 lesions P 0.004 . No chromosomal
  alterations were detected in six CIN1 lesions, five of which were completely p16
  INK4a immunonegative. These findings suggest that biomarkers associated with gains
  at chromosomes 1, 3q, and 20 are potential hallmarks of advanced p16 INK4a -positive
  CIN2 3 lesions with a high short-term risk of progression.
