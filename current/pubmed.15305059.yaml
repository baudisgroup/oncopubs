abstract: Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tumor tissue provides an opportunity
  to perform retrospective genomic studies of tumors in which chromosomal imbalances
  are strongly associated with oncogenesis. The application of comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH has led to the rapid accumulation of cytogenetic information on
  osteosarcoma OS however, the limited resolving power of metaphase CGH does not permit
  precise mapping of imbalances. Array CGH allows quantitative detection and more
  precise delineation of copy number aberrations in tumors. Unfortunately the high
  cost and lower density of BACs on available commercial arrays has limited the ability
  to comprehensively profile copy number changes in tumors such as OS that are recurrently
  subject to genomic imbalance. In this study a cDNA EST microarray including 18,980
  human cDNAs which represent all 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and chromosome
  X was used for CGH analysis of eight OS FFPE. Chromosomes 1, 12, 17, and X harbored
  the most imbalances. Gain amplification of X was observed in 4 8 OS, and in keeping
  with other recent genomic analyses of OS, gain amplification of 17p11.2 was often
  accompanied by a distal deletion in the region of the p53 gene. Gain amplification
  of the X chromosome was verified using interphase FISH carried out on a subset of
  OS FFPE sections and OS tissue arrays.
