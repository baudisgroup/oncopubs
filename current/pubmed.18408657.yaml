abstract: Olfactory neuroblastoma is an unusual neuroectodermal malignancy, which
  is thought to arise at the olfactory membrane of the sinonasal tract. Due to its
  rarity, little is understood regarding its molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities.
  The aim of the current study is to identify specific DNA copy number changes in
  olfactory neuroblastoma. Thirteen dissected tissue samples were analyzed using array
  comparative genomic hybridization. Our results show that gene copy number profiles
  of olfactory neuroblastoma samples are complex. The most frequent changes included
  gains at 7q11.22-q21.11, 9p13.3, 13q, 20p q, and Xp q, and losses at 2q31.1, 2q33.3,
  2q37.1, 6q16.3, 6q21.33, 6q22.1, 22q11.23, 22q12.1, and Xp q. Gains were more frequent
  than losses, and high-stage tumors showed more alterations than low-stage olfactory
  neuroblastoma. Frequent changes in high-stage tumors were gains at 13q14.2-q14.3,
  13q31.1, and 20q11.21-q11.23, and loss of Xp21.1 in 66 of cases . Gains at 5q35,
  13q, and 20q, and losses at 2q31.1, 2q33.3, and 6q16-q22, were present in 50 of
  cases. The identified regions of gene copy number change have been implicated in
  a variety of tumors, especially carcinomas. In addition, our results indicate that
  gains in 20q and 13q may be important in the progression of this cancer, and that
  these regions possibly harbor genes with functional relevance in olfactory neuroblastoma.
