abstract: 'Copy number alterations have been shown to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis.
  The randomized phase III clinical trial E2603: carboplatin, paclitaxel, ï¿½ sorafenib
  (CP vs. CPS) offers a large collection of tumor samples to evaluate association
  of somatic mutations, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes, prior to current
  FDA-approved therapies.Copy number and mutational analysis on 119 pretreatment samples
  was performed.CPS therapy was associated with improved progression-free survival
  (PFS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with RAF1 (cRAF) gene copy gains
  (HR, 0.372; P = 0.025) or CCND1 gene copy gains (HR, 0.45; P = 0.035). CPS therapy
  was associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared with CP in patients
  with tumors with KRAS gene copy gains (HR, 0.25; P = 0.035). BRAF gene copy gain
  and MET amplification were more common in samples with V600K versus V600E mutations
  (P < 0.001), which was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.We observed
  improved treatment response with CPS in patients with melanoma whose tumors have
  RAF1 (cRAF), KRAS, or CCND1 amplification, all of which can be attributed to sorafenib
  targeting CRAF. These genomic alterations should be incorporated in future studies
  for evaluation as biomarkers.'
