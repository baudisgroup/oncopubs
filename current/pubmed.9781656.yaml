abstract: 'Typical and atypical carcinoids TC, ATC and small SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine
  carcinomas LCNEC constitute the spectrum of neuroendocrine lung tumors. Chromosomal
  aberrations have not been studied in LCNEC and only rarely in carcinoids. Only SCLCs
  have been investigated frequently for chromosomal aberrations. We compared three
  typical and four atypical carcinoids, one atypical carcinoid SCLC mixed type, three
  SCLC, and three LCNEC for chromosomal gains and losses using comparative genomic
  hybridization. Typical carcinoids showed either no changes or only few chromosomal
  gains. Atypical carcinoids appeared genetically heterogeneous: One case had no aberrations,
  and three cases had few aberrations two of them showed a deletion of 11q. SCLC and
  LCNEC were characterized by many gains and losses, especially similar changes of
  3p, 5q, 5p, and 13q. Although ATC resemble LCNEC morphologically, there were no
  similarities at the genetic level. We have found a reciprocal relationship of prognosis
  and the amount of aberrations. TCs and ATCs with few chromosomal changes have the
  best prognosis, whereas SCLCs and LCNECs were generally characterized by a great
  amount of aberrations and worst prognosis. There was no unbalanced aberration common
  in all types of neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.'
