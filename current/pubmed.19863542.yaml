abstract: Little is known about genomic aberrations in peripheral T cell lymphoma,
  not otherwise specified PTCL NOS . We studied 47 PTCL NOS by 250k GeneChip single
  nucleotide polymorphism arrays and detected genomic imbalances in 22 of the cases.
  Recurrent gains and losses were identified, including gains of chromosome regions
  1q32-43, 2p15-16, 7, 8q24, 11q14-25, 17q11-21 and 21q11-21 amp gt or 5 cases each
  as well as losses of chromosome regions 1p35-36, 5q33, 6p22, 6q16, 6q21-22, 8p21-23,
  9p21, 10p11-12, 10q11-22, 10q25-26, 13q14, 15q24, 16q22, 16q24, 17p11, 17p13 and
  Xp22 amp gt or 4 cases each . Genomic imbalances affected several regions containing
  members of nuclear factor-kappaB signalling and genes involved in cell cycle control.
  Gains of 2p15-16 were confirmed in each of three cases analysed by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH and were associated with breakpoints at the REL locus
  in two of these cases. Three additional cases with gains of the REL locus were detected
  by FISH among 18 further PTCL NOS. Five of 27 PTCL NOS investigated showed nuclear
  expression of the REL protein by immunohistochemistry, partly associated with genomic
  gains of the REL locus. Therefore, in a subgroup of PTCL NOS gains rearrangements
  of REL and expression of REL protein may be of pathogenetic relevance.
