abstract: Pediatric de novo acute myeloid leukemia AML is an aggressive malignancy
  with current therapy resulting in cure rates of only 60 . To better understand the
  cause of the marked heterogeneity in therapeutic response and to identify new prognostic
  markers and therapeutic targets a comprehensive list of the genetic mutations that
  underlie the pathogenesis of AML is needed. To approach this goal, we examined diagnostic
  leukemic samples from a cohort of 111 children with de novo AML using single-nucleotide-polymorphism
  microarrays and candidate gene resequencing. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast
  to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL , de novo AML is characterized by
  a very low burden of genomic alterations, with a mean of only 2.38 somatic copy-number
  alterations per leukemia, and less than 1 nonsynonymous point mutation per leukemia
  in the 25 genes analyzed. Even more surprising was the observation that 34 of the
  leukemias lacked any identifiable copy-number alterations, and 28 of the leukemias
  with recurrent translocations lacked any identifiable sequence or numerical abnormalities.
  The only exception to the presence of few mutations was acute megakaryocytic leukemias,
  with the majority of these leukemias being characterized by a high number of copy-number
  alterations but rare point mutations. Despite the low overall number of lesions
  across the patient cohort, novel recurring regions of genetic alteration were identified
  that harbor known, and potential new cancer genes. These data reflect a remarkably
  low burden of genomic alterations within pediatric de novo AML, which is in stark
  contrast to most other human malignancies.
