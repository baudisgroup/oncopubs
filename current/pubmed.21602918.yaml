abstract: The molecular events in chordoma pathogenesis have not been fully delineated,
  particularly with respect to copy number changes. Understanding copy number alterations
  in chordoma may reveal critical disease mechanisms that could be exploited for tumor
  classification and therapy. We report the copy number analysis of 21 sporadic chordomas
  using array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Recurrent copy changes were
  further evaluated with immunohistochemistry, methylation specific PCR, and quantitative
  real-time PCR. Similar to previous findings, large copy number losses, involving
  chromosomes 1p, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 18, were more common than copy number gains.
  Loss of CDKN2A with or without loss of CDKN2B on 9p21.3 was observed in 16 20 80
  unique cases of which six 30 showed homozygous deletions ranging from 76 kilobases
  to 4.7 megabases. One copy loss of the 10q23.31 region which encodes PTEN was found
  in 16 20 80 cases. Loss of CDKN2A and PTEN expression in the majority of cases was
  not attributed to promoter methylation. Our sporadic chordoma cases did not show
  hotspot point mutations in some common cancer gene targets. Moreover, most of these
  sporadic tumors are not associated with T brachyury duplication or amplification.
  Deficiency of CDKN2A and PTEN expression, although shared across many other different
  types of tumors, likely represents a key aspect of chordoma pathogenesis. Sporadic
  chordomas may rely on mechanisms other than copy number gain if they indeed exploit
  T brachyury for proliferation.
