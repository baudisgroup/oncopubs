abstract: Bladder cancer is a common disease characterized by multiple recurrences
  and an invasive disease course in more than 10 of patients. It is of monoclonal
  or oligoclonal origin and genomic instability has been shown at certain loci. We
  used a 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array with an average of 2,700
  heterozygous SNPs to detect allelic imbalances AI in 37 microdissected bladder tumors
  from 17 patients. Eight tumors represented upstaging from Ta to T1, eight from T1
  to T2 , and one from Ta to T2 . The AI was strongly stage-dependent as four chromosomal
  arms showed AI in amp gt 50 of Ta samples, eight in T1, and twenty-two in T2 samples.
  The tumors showed stage-dependent clonality as 61.3 of AIs were reconfirmed in later
  T1 tumors and 84.4 in muscle-invasive tumors. Novel unstable chromosomal areas were
  identified at chromosomes 6q, 10p, 16q, 20p, 20q, and 22q. The tumors separated
  into two distinct groups, highly stable tumors all Ta tumors and unstable tumors
  2 3 muscle-invasive . All 11 unstable tumors had lost chromosome 17p areas and 90
  chromosome 8 areas affecting Netrin-1 UNC5D MAP2K4 genes as well as others. AI was
  present at the TP53 locus in 10 out of 11 unstable tumors, whereas 6 had homozygous
  TP53 mutations. Tumor distribution pattern reflected AI as seven out of eight patients
  with additional upper urinary tract tumors had genomic stable bladder tumors P amp
  lt 0.05 . These data show the power of high-resolution SNP arrays for defining clinically
  relevant AIs.
