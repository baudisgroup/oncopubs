abstract: Traditionally, non-small cell lung cancer is treated as a single disease
  entity in terms of systemic therapy. Emerging evidence suggests the major subtypes--adenocarcinoma
  AC and squamous cell carcinoma SqCC --respond differently to therapy. Identification
  of the molecular differences between these tumor types will have a significant impact
  in designing novel therapies that can improve the treatment outcome.
