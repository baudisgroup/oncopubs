abstract: The majority of patients with neuroblastoma have tumors that initially respond
  to chemotherapy, but a large proportion will experience therapy-resistant relapses.
  The molecular basis of this aggressive phenotype is unknown. Whole-genome sequencing
  of 23 paired diagnostic and relapse neuroblastomas showed clonal evolution from
  the diagnostic tumor, with a median of 29 somatic mutations unique to the relapse
  sample. Eighteen of the 23 relapse tumors (78%) showed mutations predicted to activate
  the RAS-MAPK pathway. Seven of these events were detected only in the relapse tumor,
  whereas the others showed clonal enrichment. In neuroblastoma cell lines, we also
  detected a high frequency of activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway (11/18;
  61%), and these lesions predicted sensitivity to MEK inhibition in vitro and in
  vivo. Our findings provide a rationale for genetic characterization of relapse neuroblastomas
  and show that RAS-MAPK pathway mutations may function as a biomarker for new therapeutic
  approaches to refractory disease.
