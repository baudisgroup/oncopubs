abstract: Fallopian tube carcinoma FTC is a rare, poorly studied and aggressive cancer,
  associated with poor survival. Since tumorigenesis is related to the acquisition
  of genetic changes, we used genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization
  to analyse copy number aberrations occurring in FTC in order to obtain a better
  understanding of FTC carcinogenesis and to identify prognostic events and targets
  for therapy. We used arrays of 2464 genomic clones, providing approximately 1.4
  Mb resolution across the genome to map genomic DNA copy number aberrations quantitatively
  from 14 FTC onto the human genome sequence. All tumors showed a high frequency of
  copy number aberrations with recurrent gains on 3q, 6p, 7q, 8q, 12p, 17q, 19 and
  20q, and losses involving chromosomes 4, 5q, 8p, 16q, 17p, 18q and X. Recurrent
  regions of amplification included 1p34, 8p11-q11, 8q24, 12p, 17p13, 17q12-q21, 19p13,
  19q12-q13 and 19q13. Candidate, known oncogenes mapping to these amplicons included
  CMYC 8q24 , CCNE1 19q12-q21 and AKT2 19q13 , whereas PIK3CA and KRAS, previously
  suggested to be candidate driver genes for amplification, mapped outside copy number
  maxima on 3q and 12p, respectively. The FTC were remarkably homogeneous, with some
  recurrent aberrations occurring in more than 70 of samples, which suggests a stereotyped
  pattern of tumor evolution.
