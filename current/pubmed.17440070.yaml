abstract: Tumor-derived cell lines are used as in vitro cancer models, but their ability
  to accurately reflect the phenotype and genotype of the parental histology remains
  questionable, given the prevalence of documented cell line-specific cytogenetic
  changes. We have addressed the issue of whether copy number alterations seen in
  tumor-derived cell lines reflect those observed in studies of fresh tissue by carrying
  out a meta-analysis of array-based comparative genomic hybridization data that considers
  both copy number alteration frequencies and the occurrence of cancer gene amplifications
  and homozygous deletions. Pairwise correlation comparisons between the data sets
  of seven diagnosis-specific matched tumor and cell line groups indicate that the
  trends in aberration frequencies are highly correlated between tumors and cell line
  sets of matched cancer histology relative to unmatched pairings. Despite their similarities,
  cell lines showed uniformly higher locus-specific alteration frequencies P 0.004
  and several recurring cell line-specific alterations emerged. These include the
  previously documented losses of 13q and 9p and gains of 20q, as well as additional
  undescribed cell line-specific gains of 5p, 7p, and 17q and losses of 18q and 4q.
  These results indicate that, on average, cell lines preserve in vitro the genetic
  aberrations that are unique to the parent histology from which they were derived
  while acquiring additional locus-specific alterations. These data may enable a more
  predictive understanding of individual cell lines as in vitro models of cancer biology
  and therapy.
