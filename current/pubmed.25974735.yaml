abstract: Context Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the second most common cancer
  in females in Saudi Arabia. However, the pathogenesis of PTC is still not fully
  elucidated. Objective In order to identify potential genes that play important role
  in progression of PTC, we studied the role of XIAP as a potential prognostic marker
  and therapeutic target in a large cohort of PTC samples and cell lines. Design DNA
  microarray chip was used to screen for gene copy number. XIAP expression was assessed
  by immunohistochemistry in a tissue micro-array format on a cohort of 1022 clinical
  samples. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed using Embelin and/or LY294002
  on PTC cell lines. Results XIAP was found to be amplified in 14/29 and over-expressed
  in 48.8% PTC cases. XIAP over-expression was significantly associated with old age,
  extra-thyroidal extension, tumor size, nodal involvement, tall-cell variant, advanced
  stage disease and significantly poor disease free survival (p=0.0341). XIAP was
  also significantly associated with p-AKT (p<0.0001), Bcl-Xl (p<0.0001) and Ki67
  (p=0.0006) proteins. Embelin treatment caused growth inhibition and apoptosis in
  PTC cell lines and induced tumor regression in PTC xenograft in nude mice. Finally,
  combination of sub-optimal doses of Embelin and LY294002 induced a synergistic apoptotic
  response in PTC cells. Conclusion XIAP dysregulation in PTC confers an aggressive
  phenotype with poor outcome. In vitro and in vivo studies using XIAP inhibitor suggest
  that this sub-group of PTC with over-expression of XIAP can be therapeutically targeted
  either alone or in combination to induce efficient apoptosis in these cancers.
