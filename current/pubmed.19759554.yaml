abstract: Mycosis fungoide MF patients who develop tumors or extracutaneous involvement
  usually have a poor prognosis with no curative therapy available so far. In the
  present European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer EORTC multicenter
  study, the genomic profile of 41 skin biopsies from tumor stage MF MFt was analyzed
  using a high-resolution oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization platform.
  Seventy-six percent of cases showed genomic aberrations. The most common imbalances
  were gains of 7q33.3q35 followed by 17q21.1, 8q24.21, 9q34qter, and 10p14 and losses
  of 9p21.3 followed by 9q31.2, 17p13.1, 13q14.11, 6q21.3, 10p11.22, 16q23.2, and
  16q24.3. Three specific chromosomal regions, 9p21.3, 8q24.21, and 10q26qter, were
  defined as prognostic markers showing a significant correlation with overall survival
  OS P 0.042, 0.017, and 0.022, respectively . Moreover, we have established two MFt
  genomic subgroups distinguishing a stable group 0-5 DNA aberrations and an unstable
  group amp gt 5 DNA aberrations , showing that the genomic unstable group had a shorter
  OS P 0.05 . We therefore conclude that specific chromosomal abnormalities, such
  as gains of 8q24.21 MYC and losses of 9p21.3 CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP and 10q26qter
  MGMT and EBF3 may have an important role in prognosis. In addition, we describe
  the MFt genomic instability profile, which, to our knowledge, has not been reported
  earlier.
