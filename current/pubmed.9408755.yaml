abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to screen for genomic imbalances
  in 24 exocrine pancreatic carcinomas, including II low-passage cell lines 4-8 subcultures
  and 13 uncultured samples. Aberrations were found in all cell lines and in seven
  of the 13 biopsies. The most frequent changes in the cell lines were gains of 20q
  91 , 11q 64 , 17q 64 , 19q 64 , 8q, 12p, 14q, and 20p 55 , and losses of 18q 100
  , 9p 91 , 15q 73 , 21q 64 , 3p 55 , and 13q 55 . High-levels gains tumor to normal
  ratio over 1.5 were detected at 3q, 6p, 7q, 8q, 12p, 19q, and 20q. Among the tumor
  biopsies, overrepresentations of 7p and 8q were most common 31 , followed by 5p,
  5q, 11p, 11q, 12p, and 18q 23 , whereas the most frequent losses involved 18p and
  18q 31 and 6q and 17p 23 . The genetic changes in nine samples obtained from metastatic
  lesions did not differ significantly from those in 15 primary carcinomas. Most of
  the gains and losses detected in this CGH study correspond well to those identified
  in previous cytogenetic and molecular genetic investigations of pancreatic carcinomas.
  However, frequent gain of 12p and loss of 15q have not been previously reported.
  Molecular genetic analyses of these chromosome arms are warranted, and may lead
  to the discovery of novel genes important in pancreatic carcinogenesis.
