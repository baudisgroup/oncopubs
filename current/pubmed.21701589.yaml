abstract: It is well established that genomic alterations play an essential role in
  oncogenesis, disease progression, and response of tumors to therapeutic intervention.
  The advances of next-generation sequencing technologies NGS provide unprecedented
  capabilities to scan genomes for changes such as mutations, deletions, and alterations
  of chromosomal copy number. However, the cost of full-genome sequencing still prevents
  the routine application of NGS in many areas. Capturing and sequencing the coding
  exons of genes the amp quot exome amp quot can be a cost-effective approach for
  identifying changes that result in alteration of protein sequences. We applied an
  exome-sequencing technology Roche Nimblegen capture paired with 454 sequencing to
  identify sequence variation and mutations in eight commonly used cancer cell lines
  from a variety of tissue origins A2780, A549, Colo205, GTL16, NCI-H661, MDA-MB468,
  PC3, and RD . We showed that this technology can accurately identify sequence variation,
  providing 95 concordance with Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 performed on the same cell
  lines. Furthermore, we detected 19 of the 21 mutations reported in Sanger COSMIC
  database for these cell lines. We identified an average of 2,779 potential novel
  sequence variations mutations per cell line, of which 1,904 were non-synonymous.
  Many non-synonymous changes were identified in kinases and known cancer-related
  genes. In addition we confirmed that the read-depth of exome sequence data can be
  used to estimate high-level gene amplifications and identify homologous deletions.
  In summary, we demonstrate that exome sequencing can be a reliable and cost-effective
  way for identifying alterations in cancer genomes, and we have generated a comprehensive
  catalogue of genomic alterations in coding regions of eight cancer cell lines. These
  findings could provide important insights into cancer pathways and mechanisms of
  resistance to anti-cancer therapies.
