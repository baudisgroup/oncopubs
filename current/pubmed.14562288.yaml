abstract: The histological transformation from a follicular lymphoma FL to a diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma DLBL occurs in 22 to 30 of all cases of FL. The aim of this
  study was to identify specific chromosomal gains losses associated with transformation
  of FL to DLBL, in addition to the well-known mechanisms like p53 mutation and protein
  expression and c-myc translocation and up-regulation. This is the first study to
  meet 2 important conditions for such a comparison. First, we demonstrate that the
  FL and the DLBL were clonally related, based on identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements
  in 5 of the 6 cases. Second, we used laser microdissection microscopy to isolate
  only the neoplastic cells from the initial FL samples. The results indicate that
  no single chromosomal abnormality seems to be responsible for the transformation
  of FL to DLBL. P53 protein overexpression was found in 4 and c-myc translocation
  in 3 of the 6 transformed DLBLs, but not in the initial FL samples. Additional chromosomal
  abnormalities were detected by comparative genomic hybridization in all 6 cases
  when the DLBL was compared with the FL. In the 5 cases with transformation of grade
  1 or 2 FL to DLBL, gains at chromosomes 7 5 of 5 cases , 10p1 3 of 5 cases , 12
  3 of 5 cases , and 20p13 2 of 5 cases and loss at 9q 4 of 5 cases were the most
  frequently found abnormalities. A gain on chromosome 7p, in combination with a loss
  on 9q, was found in 4 of the 5 DLBL that transformed from FL grade 1 or 2.
