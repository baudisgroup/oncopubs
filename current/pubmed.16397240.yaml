abstract: To identify genetic alterations underlying rectal carcinogenesis, we used
  global gene expression profiling of a series of 17 locally advanced rectal adenocarcinomas
  and 20 normal rectal mucosa biopsies on oligonucleotide arrays. A total of 351 genes
  were differentially expressed P amp lt 1.0e-7 between normal rectal mucosa and rectal
  carcinomas, 77 genes had a amp gt 5-fold difference, and 85 genes always had at
  least a 2-fold change in all of the matched samples. Twelve genes satisfied all
  three of these criteria. Altered expression of genes such as PTGS2 COX-2 , WNT1,
  TGFB1, VEGF, and MYC was confirmed, whereas our data for other genes, like PPARD
  and LEF1, were inconsistent with previous reports. In addition, we found deregulated
  expression of many genes whose involvement in rectal carcinogenesis has not been
  reported. By mapping the genomic imbalances in the tumors using comparative genomic
  hybridization, we could show that DNA copy number gains of recurrently aneuploid
  chromosome arms 7p, 8q, 13q, 18q, 20p, and 20q correlated significantly with their
  average chromosome arm expression profile. Taken together, our results show that
  both the high-level, significant transcriptional deregulation of specific genes
  and general modification of the average transcriptional activity of genes residing
  on aneuploid chromosomes coexist in rectal adenocarcinomas.
