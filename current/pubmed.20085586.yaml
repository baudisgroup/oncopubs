abstract: Improved methods for predicting chemoresponsiveness involving the identification
  of polymorphic markers is highly desirable, considering narrow therapeutic index
  and frequent resistance to anti-cancer regimens. The genome-wide screening of chemosensitive
  single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs was undertaken in association with in vitro
  chemosensitivity assays in 104 colorectal cancer patients for the initial screening
  step. Allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, potential function, and Hardy-Weinberg
  equilibrium of the candidate SNPs were then determined for the identifying step.
  Finally, clinical association analysis in the other 260 evaluable patients or cell
  viability assays of transfected RKO cells was used to verify candidate SNPs for
  the validation step. In total, 12 SNPs to six regimens were initially chosen during
  the screening and identifying steps. In patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based
  adjuvant chemotherapy, the substitution alleles of GPC5 rs553717 AA correlated significantly
  with tumor recurrence and shorter disease-free survival P 0.019 and 0.023, respectively
  . Interestingly, RKO cells expressing mutant GPC5 showed enhanced cell death in
  response to 5-FU in cytotoxicity assays. Patients that were homozygous for the reference
  alleles SSTR4 rs2567608 AA and EPHA7 rs2278107 TT showed lower disease control rates
  in response to irinotecan and oxaliplatin regimens, respectively, than those with
  substitution alleles P 0.022 and 0.014, respectively . Thus, we identified chemosensitive
  SNP markers using a novel three step process of genome-wide analysis consisting
  of in vitro screening, identification, and validation. The candidate chemosensitive
  SNP markers identified in our study, including those identified in vitro, can now
  be further verified in a large cohort study.
