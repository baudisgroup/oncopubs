abstract: Testicular germ cell tumors TGCT represent the most common malignancy among
  young males. To our knowledge no comprehensive Copy Number Variation CNVs studies
  of TGCT using high-resolution Single Nucleotide Polymorphism SNP array have been
  performed. By a genome-wide analysis of CNV and loss of heterozygosity LOH in 25
  primary seminomas, we confirmed several previously reported genomic alterations
  and discovered eight novel genomic alterations including amplifications and homozygous
  deletions. Moreover, a comparison of genomic alterations of early and late stage
  seminoma identified CNVs that correlate with progression, which included deletions
  in chromosomes 4q, 5p, 9q, 13q and 20p and amplifications in chromosomes 9q and
  13q. We compared previously perform Affymetrix expression analysis in a subset of
  samples and found robust correlation between expression and genomic alterations.
  Furthermore, high correlations 40-75 were observed between CNV by SNP analysis and
  quantitative PCR. Our findings may lead to better understanding of TGTCs pathogenesis.
