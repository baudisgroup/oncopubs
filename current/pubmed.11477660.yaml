abstract: In order to approach the genetic mechanisms behind initiation and progression
  of papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC tumorigenesis, we characterized numerical chromosomal
  imbalances in a panel of 25 PTCs with varying histopathological and clinical features
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The most frequently detected imbalance
  was gain of 9q33-qter, which was seen in close to 30 of the cases. The commonly
  occurring regions of loss were assigned to 22q 12 and 9q21.3-q32 12 , while gains
  preferentially involved the entire X chromosome 20 , 1q 16 , 17q 16 , and 22q 12
  . The distribution of CGH alterations supports the idea of a progression of genetic
  events in the development of PTC, where gain of 9q33-qter would represent a relatively
  early event that is followed by loss of 22q and gain of X, 1q, 17q, and 22q. When
  the detected CGH alterations were compared with the clinical outcome and the histopathological
  features of the 25 PTC cases, several statistically significant correlations were
  revealed. The total number of genetic alterations was higher in tumors from patients
  with aggressive disease as compared to those without signs of aggressiveness. Gain
  of 1q and loss of 9q21.3-q32 were exclusively seen in tumors from patients with
  aggressive disease, and the presence of distant metastases was associated with gain
  of 1q. A sex-dependent distribution was also evident for one of the common alterations,
  with gain of X exclusively seen in male cases. Taken together, the findings identify
  several candidate locations for tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that are potentially
  involved in the establishment and progression of papillary thyroid carcinogenesis.
