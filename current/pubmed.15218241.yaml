abstract: Neuroblastoma, one of the most common tumors of childhood, presents at diagnosis
  with a vast number of recurrent chromosomal imbalances that include hyperdiploidy
  for whole chromosomes, partial loss of 1p, 3p, 4p, 11q, 14q, partial gain of 1q,
  7q, 17q and amplification of MYCN. These abnormalities are nonrandomly distributed
  in neuroblastoma as loss of 3p and 11q rarely occur in MYCN amplified neuroblastomas.
  Here, we report on a patient who had a non-MYCN amplified 3p- 11q- neuroblastoma
  at diagnosis who subsequently developed a high level of MYCN amplification in bone
  marrow metastases 41 months after induction of complete remission. The tumor at
  diagnosis had low level unbalanced gain of distal 2p. In order to assess the frequency
  of low level gain of distal 2p in neuroblastoma, we examined the comparative genomic
  hybridization results from 60 neuroblastomas. Among non-MYCN amplified neuroblastomas,
  8 45 18 had low level gain of distal 2p. Low level gain for a segment of 2p i.e.
  a region larger than the 2p23-- amp gt p24 undergoing amplification was also detected
  in five of the 15 tumors that had high level MYCN amplification. The possibility
  that low level gain of distal 2p is a risk factor for high level MYCN amplification
  is discussed.
