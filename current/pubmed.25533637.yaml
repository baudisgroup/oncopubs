abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal malignancy whose clinical intransigence has
  been linked to extensive intraclonal genetic and phenotypic diversity and the common
  emergence of therapeutic resistance. This interpretation embodies the implicit assumption
  that cancer stem cells or tumor-propagating cells are themselves genetically and
  functionally diverse. To test this, we screened primary GBM tumors by SNP array
  to identify copy number alterations (a minimum of three) that could be visualized
  in single cells by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. Interrogation
  of neurosphere-derived cells (from four patients) and cells derived from secondary
  transplants of these same cells in NOD-SCID mice allowed us to infer the clonal
  and phylogenetic architectures. Whole-exome sequencing and single-cell genetic analysis
  in one case revealed a more complex clonal structure. This proof-of-principle experiment
  revealed that subclones in each GBM had variable regenerative or stem cell activity,
  and highlighted genetic alterations associated with more competitive propagating
  activity in vivo.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All
