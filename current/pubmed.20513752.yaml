abstract: The ETV6 RUNX1 fusion gene, present in 25 of B-lineage childhood acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia ALL , is thought to represent an initiating event, which requires additional
  genetic changes for leukemia development. To identify additional genetic alterations,
  24 ETV6 RUNX1-positive ALLs were analyzed using 500K single nucleotide polymorphism
  arrays. The results were combined with previously published data sets, allowing
  us to ascertain genomic copy number aberrations CNAs in 164 cases. In total, 45
  recurrent CNAs were identified with an average number of 3.5 recurrent changes per
  case range 0-13 . Twenty-six percent of cases displayed a set of recurrent CNAs
  identical to that of other cases in the data set. The majority 74 , however, displayed
  a unique pattern of recurrent CNAs, indicating a large heterogeneity within this
  ALL subtype. As previously demonstrated, alterations targeting genes involved in
  B-cell development were common present in 28 of cases . However, the combined analysis
  also identified alterations affecting nuclear hormone response 24 to be a characteristic
  feature of ETV6 RUNX1-positive ALL. Studying the correlation pattern of the CNAs
  allowed us to highlight significant positive and negative correlations between specific
  aberrations. Furthermore, oncogenetic tree models identified ETV6, CDKN2A B, PAX5,
  del 6q and 16 as possible early events in the leukemogenic process.
