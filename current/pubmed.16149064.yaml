abstract: Detailed analysis of mechanisms of genetic loss for specific tumor suppressor
  genes TSGs e.g., RB1, APC and NF1 indicates that TSG inactivation can occur by allelic
  loss of heterozygosity LOH , without any alteration in DNA copy number. However,
  the role and prevalence of such events in the pathogenesis of specific malignancies
  remains to be established on a genome-wide basis. We undertook a detailed molecular
  assessment of chromosomal defects in a panel of nine cell lines derived from primary
  medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood, by parallel
  genome-wide assessment of LOH allelotyping and copy number aberrations comparative
  genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization . The majority of genetic
  losses observed were detected by both copy number and LOH methods, indicating they
  arise through the physical deletion of chromosomal material. However, a significant
  proportion of losses 17 42, 40 represented regions of allelic LOH without any associated
  copy number reduction these events involved both whole chromosomes 10 17 and sub-chromosomal
  regions 7 17 . Using this approach, we identified medulloblastoma-characteristic
  alterations, e.g., isochromosome for 17q, MYC amplification and losses on chromosomes
  10, 11, and 16, alongside novel regions of genetic loss e.g., 10q21.1-26.3, 11q24.1-qter
  . This detailed genetic characterization of the majority of medulloblastoma cell
  lines provides important precedent for the widespread involvement of copy number-neutral
  genetic losses in medulloblastoma and demonstrates that combined assessment of copy
  number aberrations and LOH will be necessary to accurately determine the contribution
  of chromosomal defects to tumor development.
