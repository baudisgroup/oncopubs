abstract: Mature B-cell lymphomas with both BCL2 and MYC translocations are known
  as amp quot double hit amp quot lymphomas. These lymphomas are aggressive and show
  high proliferation rate due to the growth advantages provided by MYC and BCL2 translocation
  and overexpression. Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is a neoplasm of mature B-lymphocytes
  with characteristic t 11 14 and subsequent Cyclin D1 overexpression. Secondary cytogenetic
  changes are frequent in MCL, but MYC translocation has only been rarely reported.
  In this study, we report four cases of MCL with MYC translocation or MYC gene amplification
  detected by conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole
  genome single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array, and determined the clinicopathologic
  features. Our study provides further evidence supporting the concept of amp quot
  double hit amp quot MCL with co-involvement of MYC gene rearrangement and or amplification
  and CCND1 gene rearrangement.
