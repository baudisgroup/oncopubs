abstract: Only a few cytogenetic and genetic studies have been performed in gastric
  cancer patients in young age groups. In the present study we used the comparative
  genomic hybridisation CGH method to characterise frequent DNA copy number changes
  in 22 gastric cancer patients of 45 years or younger and three gastric cancer cell
  lines established from patients younger than 45 years. Analysis of DNA copy number
  changes revealed frequent DNA copy number increases at chromosomes 17q 52 , 19q
  68 and 20q 64 . To confirm the CGH results and to characterise the amplicon region
  on the most frequently amplified chromosome, chromosome 19, we carried out fluorescence
  in situ hybridisation FISH analysis and Southern blot analysis. Fluorescence in
  situ hybridisation with the bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clone mapped to
  19q12 indicated a copy number increase in all eight tumour specimens studied. Southern
  blot analysis of six tumour specimens and three tumour cell lines, with five probes
  mapped to the 19q12-13.2 region, suggested cyclin E to be one of the candidate target
  genes in the 19q region for gastric cancer tumorigenesis. Cyclin E protein overexpression
  was verified in tumours with amplification on chromosome 19. Further studies are
  required to investigate the biological and clinical significance of 19q amplicon
  and cyclin E upregulation in gastric cancer of young patients.
