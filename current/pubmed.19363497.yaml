abstract: Many studies have shown that primary prostate cancers are multifocal and
  are composed of multiple genetically distinct cancer cell clones. Whether or not
  multiclonal primary prostate cancers typically give rise to multiclonal or monoclonal
  prostate cancer metastases is largely unknown, although studies at single chromosomal
  loci are consistent with the latter case. Here we show through a high-resolution
  genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number survey that most, if
  not all, metastatic prostate cancers have monoclonal origins and maintain a unique
  signature copy number pattern of the parent cancer cell while also accumulating
  a variable number of separate subclonally sustained changes. We find no relationship
  between anatomic site of metastasis and genomic copy number change pattern. Taken
  together with past animal and cytogenetic studies of metastasis and recent single-locus
  genetic data in prostate and other metastatic cancers, these data indicate that
  despite common genomic heterogeneity in primary cancers, most metastatic cancers
  arise from a single precursor cancer cell. This study establishes that genomic archeology
  of multiple anatomically separate metastatic cancers in individuals can be used
  to define the salient genomic features of a parent cancer clone of proven lethal
  metastatic phenotype.
