abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTC) have been found in patients with metastatic
  melanoma and are associated with advanced melanoma stage and poor patient outcome.
  We hypothesize that CTC harbor genomic changes critical in the development of distant
  systemic metastasis. Here, we present the first genome-wide copy-number aberration
  (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)-based characterization of melanoma CTC.  CTC
  were isolated from peripheral blood monocytes of 13 melanoma patients with regional
  metastasis stage IIIB/C using antibodies against melanoma-associated cell surface
  gangliosides.  We characterized 251 CNA in CTC. Comparative analysis demonstrated
  >90% concordance in single-nucleotide polymorphism profiles between paired CTC and
  tumor metastases. In particular, there were notable recurring CNA across patients.
  In exploratory studies, the presence of several top CTC-associated CNA was verified
  in distant metastasis (stage IV) from 27 patients, suggesting that certain genomic
  changes are propagated from regional metastasis to CTC and to distant systemic metastases.
  Lastly, an exploratory biomarker panel derived from 5 CTC-associated CNA [CSMD2
  (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 2), 1p35.1; CNTNAP5 (contactin associated protein-like
  5), 2q14.3; NRDE2 (NRDE-2, necessary for RNA interference, domain containing), 14q32.11;
  ADAM6 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 6, pseudogene), 14q32.33; and TRPM2 (transient
  receptor potential cation channel, subfamily m, member 2), 21q22.3] conferred prognostic
  utility for melanoma recurrence [hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; CI, 1.00-1.44; P = 0.0471]
  and death (HR, 2.86; CI, 1.23-14.42; P = 0.0014) in 35 patients with stage IIIB/C
  melanoma, with a 5-year disease-free survival of 13% vs 69% (P = 0.0006) and overall
  survival of 28% vs 94% between high-risk and low-risk groups defined by the biomarker
  panel, respectively.  This study provides the first detailed CNA-based profile of
  melanoma CTC and illustrates how CTC may be used as a novel approach for identification
  of systemic metastasis.  ï¿½ 2014 The American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
