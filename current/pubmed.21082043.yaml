abstract: Aneuploidy is among the most obvious differences between normal and cancer
  cells. However, mechanisms contributing to development and maintenance of aneuploid
  cell growth are diverse and incompletely understood. Functional genomics analyses
  have shown that aneuploidy in cancer cells is correlated with diffuse gene expression
  signatures and aneuploidy can arise by a variety of mechanisms, including cytokinesis
  failures, DNA endoreplication, and possibly through polyploid intermediate states.
  To identify molecular processes contributing to development of aneuploidy, we used
  a cell spot microarray technique to identify genes inducing polyploidy and or allowing
  maintenance of polyploid cell growth in breast cancer cells. Of 5760 human genes
  screened, 177 were found to induce severe DNA content alterations on prolonged transient
  silencing. Association with response to DNA damage stimulus and DNA repair was found
  to be the most enriched cellular processes among the candidate genes. Functional
  validation analysis of these genes highlighted GINS2 as the highest ranking candidate
  inducing polyploidy, accumulation of endogenous DNA damage, and impairing cell proliferation
  on inhibition. The cell growth inhibition and induction of polyploidy by suppression
  of GINS2 was verified in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Bioinformatic analysis
  of published gene expression and DNA copy number studies of clinical breast tumors
  suggested GINS2 to be associated with the aggressive characteristics of a subgroup
  of breast cancers in vivo. In addition, nuclear GINS2 protein levels distinguished
  actively proliferating cancer cells suggesting potential use of GINS2 staining as
  a biomarker of cell proliferation as well as a potential therapeutic target.
