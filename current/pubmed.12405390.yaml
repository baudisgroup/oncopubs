abstract: Hemangioblastomas HBs occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau
  VHL disease. In the majority of VHL-related HBs, inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor
  gene TSG , which is located on chromosome 3p25-26, is found. The VHL gene is assumed
  to be involved also in the development of sporadic HBs. In a previous study of chromosomal
  aberrations of sporadic HBs, multiple chromosomal imbalances were found in the majority
  of tumors. The aim of this study was to analyze further both sporadic HBs and VHL-related
  HBs to determine if these histopathologically identical tumors have a different
  genetic background.
