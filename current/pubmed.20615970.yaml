abstract: The goal of this study was to characterize and classify pulmonary neuroendocrine
  tumors based on array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . Using aCGH, we performed
  karyotype analysis of 33 small cell lung cancer SCLC tumors, 13 SCLC cell lines,
  19 bronchial carcinoids, and 9 gastrointestinal carcinoids. In contrast to the relatively
  conserved karyotypes of carcinoid tumors, the karyotypes of SCLC tumors and cell
  lines were highly aberrant. High copy number CN gains were detected in SCLC tumors
  and cell lines in cytogenetic bands encoding JAK2, FGFR1, and MYC family members.
  In some of those samples, the CN of these genes exceeded 100, suggesting that they
  could represent driver alterations and potential drug targets in subgroups of SCLC
  patients. In SCLC tumors, as well as bronchial carcinoids and carcinoids of gastrointestinal
  origin, recurrent CN alterations were observed in 203 genes, including the RB1 gene
  and 59 microRNAs of which 51 locate in the DLK1-DIO3 domain. These findings suggest
  the existence of partially shared CN alterations in these tumor types. In contrast,
  CN alterations of the TP53 gene and the MYC family members were predominantly observed
  in SCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the aCGH profile of SCLC cell lines highly
  resembles that of clinical SCLC specimens. Finally, by analyzing potential drug
  targets, we provide a genomics-based rationale for targeting the AKT-mTOR and apoptosis
  pathways in SCLC.
