abstract: The term amp quot multiforme amp quot in glioblastoma multiforme GBM indicates
  the highly variable histomorphology that cannot be addressed by studies on homogenized
  tissue probes. In order to relate genetic findings with histomorphologically distinct
  areas we used microdissection to procure defined cell populations from microscopic
  tissue sections under direct visualization. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
  tissue sections of 10 GBM were evaluated for intratumoral genetic heterogeneity
  by microdissection of multiple areas of 20-50 tumor cells and DOP-PCR of DNA isolated
  from the dissected cell groups, followed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . Microdissected cells from histomorphologically normal extratumoral blood vessels
  from the same slides served as controls. The individual tumors showed variable combinations
  of primary chromosomal gains and losses common to all studied areas of a given case
  along with secondary, area-specific additional aberrations. CGH displayed a wider
  variety of chromosomal aberrations than metaphase cytogenetics of cell cultures
  from the same tumors. The most frequent aberrations observed were previously unperceived
  gains on chromosomes 4q 8 10 and 5q 5 10 . Other nonrandom aberrations were gains
  on 12q 6 10 , 13q 6 10 , and 7 5 10 , and losses of 22 5 10 . Amplifications on
  7p were intratumorally heterogeneous and only found in single areas of 2 tumors.
  In contrast to normal extratumoral vessels, vascular proliferates in most cases
  demonstrated chromosomal aberrations CGH which were partially different from the
  aberrations observed in the tumor itself. The described method gives evidence of
  considerable intratumoral genetic heterogeneity in GBM and provides a sensitive
  tool for the detection of quantitative chromosomal changes that are present only
  regionally within a given tumor.
