abstract: 'Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous
  disease entity. It is characterized by persistent eosinophilia and organ damage
  after excluding other causes. Clonal eosinophilia is distinguished from idiopathic
  eosinophilia by the presence of histologic, cytogenetic, or molecular evidence of
  an underlying malignancy. There are two distinct subcategories of clonal eosinophilia:
  chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms
  with eosinophilia and mutations involving platelet-derived growth factor receptor
  Î±/Î² or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. More than 50% of HES are without knowledge
  of underlying pathogenic molecular pathways. Here we examined a HES patient by oligo-based
  aCGH analysis and molecular cytogenetic methods. Examination for the common eosinophilia-related
  cytogenetic abnormalities involving the genes PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1 together
  with BCR-ABL fusion gene was negative. Cytogenetic analysis and multi-color FISH
  analysis revealed a novel cryptic three-way translocation t(2;11;5)(p21.3;q13.5;q23.2).
  By oaCGH analysis we could not find any copy number changes related to the cytogenetic
  breakpoints but instead detected a 0.9Mb submicroscopic deletion at 11p14.3. The
  deleted region involved the 5''-upstream sequences and exons 1-4 of the LUZP2 gene,
  which encodes a leucine zipper protein. Analysis of surrogate germ-line cells revealed
  a normal result showing that the detected chromosomal aberrations were acquired.
  This is the first report on a HES patient associated with a novel complex three-way
  translocation t(2;11;5)(p21.3;q13.5;q23.2) and a submicroscopic deletion in chromosome
  band 11p14.3. The study also demonstrates the benefits of oligo-based aCGH analysis
  in detecting hidden disease related chromosomal abnormalities. The present findings
  provide additional clues to unravel important molecular pathways in HES to obtain
  the full spectrum of acquired chromosomal and genomic aberrations in this heterogeneous
  disease entity. As more cases become characterized this may eventually improve on
  classification and treatment options.  Copyright Â© 2015. Published by Elsevier
