abstract: We established a novel human myxofibrosarcoma cell line NMFH-1 and analyzed
  it with spectral karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . NMFH-1
  cells are composed of two different types of cells, small, spindle-shaped mononuclear
  cells and bizarre multinucleated giant cells, which were maintained in vitro over
  200 passages. Xenografted tumor showed typical features of myxofibrosarcoma, which
  included bizarre multinucleated giant cells. Cytogenetic analyses revealed complex
  abnormalities, including a t 17 22 q2 2 q13 , which has been found in dermatofibrosarcoma
  protuberans. Subsequent reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed
  that the cell line did not have the COL1A1-PDGFB gene fusion. Significant gains
  of the 1q12 approximately q23 and 8q13 approximately qter regions and loss of the
  9p21 approximately pter and 13q12 regions often found in MFH were observed by CGH
  analysis. We investigated the origin of multinucleated giant cells in xenografted
  tumor through DNA in situ hybridization. In this system, the human-specific Alu
  sequence and the mouse L1 sequence were used as specific cell markers of identity.
  In situ hybridization revealed neoplastic proliferation of the multinucleated giant
  cells of human origin.
