abstract: Rhabdomyosarcoma, the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma, likely
  results from deregulation of the skeletal myogenesis program. Although associations
  between PAX3, PAX7, FOXO1A, and RMS tumorigenesis are well recognized, the entire
  spectrum of genetic factors underlying RMS development and progression is unclear.
  Using a combined approach of spectral karyotyping, array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH , and expression analysis, we examined 10 primary RMS tumors,
  including embryonal, alveolar, and the rare adult pleomorphic variant, to explore
  the involvement of different genes and genetic pathways in RMS tumorigenesis. A
  complete karyotype established for each tumor revealed a high aneuploidy level,
  mostly tetraploidy, with double minutes and additional structural aberrations. Quantitative
  expression analysis detected the overexpression of the AURKA gene in all tumors
  tested, suggesting a role for this mitotic regulator in the aneuploidy and chromosomal
  instability observed in RMS. Array-based CGH analysis in primary RMS tumors detected
  copy number changes of genes involved in multiple genetic pathways, including transcription
  factors such as MYC-related gene from lung cancer and the cytoskeleton and cell
  adhesion-encoding genes laminin gamma-2 and p21-activated kinase-1. Our data suggest
  the involvement of genes encoding cell adhesion, cytoskeletal signaling, and transcriptional
  and cell cycle components in RMS tumorigenesis.
