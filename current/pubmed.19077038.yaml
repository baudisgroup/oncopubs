abstract: Meningiomas are recognized as the most common late complication following
  radiotherapy. However, cytogenetic studies in childhood atypical radiation-induced
  meningioma are sporadic, mainly because this condition generally occurs after a
  long latent period. In the present study we show the results of conventional and
  molecular cytogenetics in a 14-year-old boy with a secondary atypical meningioma.
  Apart from numerical changes, we found complex aberrations with the participation
  of chromosomes 1, 6 and 12. The invariable presence of loss of 1p was demonstrated
  by fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH analysis with probes directed to telomeric
  regions and by comparative genome hybridization CGH . Previous cytogenetic studies
  on adult spontaneous and radiation-associated meningiomas showed loss of chromosome
  22 as the most frequent change, followed by loss of the short arm of chromosome
  1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of highly complex chromosome
  aberrations in the pediatric setting of meningioma.
