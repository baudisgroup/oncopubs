abstract: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is a widely used technique
  to assess chromosomal copy number alterations. Chromosomal content, however, is
  often not uniform throughout cell populations. Here we evaluated to what extent
  aCGH can detect DNA copy number alterations in heterogeneous cell populations. A
  systematic evaluation is currently lacking, despite its importance in diagnostics
  and research. The detection limits reported are a compound of analytical software
  and laboratory techniques and do not account for the number of probes in relation
  to sample homogeneity.  Detection limits were explored with DNA isolated from a
  patient with intellectual disability (ID) and from tumor cell line BT474. Both were
  diluted with increasing amounts of normal DNA to simulate different levels of cellularity.
  Samples were hybridized on microarrays containing 180,880 oligonucleotides evenly
  distributed over the genome (spacing ~17ï¿½kb).  Single copy number alterations,
  represented by down to 249 probes (4ï¿½Mb) and present in 10ï¿½% of a cell population,
  could be detected. Alterations encompassing as few as 14 probes (~238ï¿½Kb) could
  also be detected, but for this a 35ï¿½% mosaic level was required.  DNA copy number
  alterations can be detected in cell populations containing 10ï¿½% abnormal cells.
  Detection of sub-megabase alterations requires a higher percentage of abnormal cells
  or microarrays with a higher probe density.
