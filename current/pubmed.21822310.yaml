abstract: Despite extensive characterization of the role of the EWS-ETS fusions, little
  is known about secondary genetic alterations and their clinical contribution to
  Ewing sarcoma ES . It has been demonstrated that the molecular structure of EWS-ETS
  lacks prognostic value. Moreover, CDKN2A deletion and TP53 mutation, despite carrying
  a poor prognosis, are infrequent. In this scenario identifying secondary genetic
  alterations with a significant prevalence could contribute to understand the molecular
  mechanisms underlying the most aggressive forms of ES.We screened a 67 ES tumor
  set for copy number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization. 1q gain
  1qG , detected in 31 of tumor samples, was found markedly associated with relapse
  and poor overall and disease-free survival and demonstrated a prognostic value independent
  of classical clinical parameters. Reanalysis of an expression dataset belonging
  to an independent tumor set n 37 not only validated this finding but also led us
  to identify a transcriptomic profile of severe cell cycle deregulation in 1qG ES
  tumors. Consistently, a higher proliferation rate was detected in this tumor subset
  by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. CDT2, a 1q-located candidate gene encoding a protein
  involved in ubiquitin ligase activity and significantly overexpressed in 1qG ES
  tumors, was validated in vitro and in vivo proving its major contribution to this
  molecular and clinical phenotype. This integrative genomic study of 105 ES tumors
  in overall renders the potential value of 1qG and CDT2 overexpression as prognostic
  biomarkers and also affords a rationale for the application of already available
  new therapeutic compounds selectively targeting the protein-ubiquitin machinery.
