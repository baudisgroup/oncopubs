abstract: The prognosis of colorectal cancer patients is to a considerable extent
  determined by the metastatic potency of the primary tumor. However, despite the
  fact that liver metastases are the leading cause of death for cancer patients, the
  molecular basis still remains poorly understood and independent prognostic markers
  have not been established.
