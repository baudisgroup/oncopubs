abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a dismal prognosis and insights
  into both disease etiology and targeted intervention are needed. A total of 109
  micro-dissected PDA cases were subjected to whole-exome sequencing. Microdissection
  enriches tumour cellularity and enhances mutation calling. Here we show that environmental
  stress and alterations in DNA repair genes associate with distinct mutation spectra.
  Copy number alterations target multiple tumour suppressive/oncogenic loci; however,
  amplification of MYC is uniquely associated with poor outcome and adenosquamous
  subtype. We identify multiple novel mutated genes in PDA, with select genes harbouring
  prognostic significance. RBM10 mutations associate with longer survival in spite
  of histological features of aggressive disease. KRAS mutations are observed in >90%
  of cases, but codon Q61 alleles are selectively associated with improved survival.
  Oncogenic BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive with KRAS and define sensitivity
  to vemurafenib in PDA models. High-frequency alterations in Wnt signalling, chromatin
  remodelling, Hedgehog signalling, DNA repair and cell cycle processes are observed.
  Together, these data delineate new genetic diversity of PDA and provide insights
  into prognostic determinants and therapeutic targets.
