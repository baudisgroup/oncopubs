abstract: The progression from precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer, including pancreatic
  intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), to
  invasive disease is characterized by stepwise accumulation of genetic alterations.
  However, it remains unclear whether additional alterations are required for the
  progression of high-grade neoplasms to invasive pancreatic carcinoma. We compared
  the genomic profiles of paired noninvasive and invasive carcinoma tissues collected
  from patients with IPMN. We demonstrate that the frequency of genomic copy-number
  aberrations significantly increased during the course of invasion, and the loss
  of 8p11.22-ter was more often associated with invasive tissues. Expression profiling
  in pancreatic cancer cell lines with and without 8p11.22-ter revealed that DUSP4,
  an MAPK phosphatase, was significantly downregulated in cells lacking 8p11.22-ter
  as well as in invasive carcinomas due to genomic loss. Restoration of DUSP4 expression
  in pancreatic cancer cells significantly suppressed invasiveness and anoikis resistance
  via ERK inactivation. Accordingly, we found that blockade of ERK signaling by MEK
  inhibition was effective in an orthotopic xenograft model and significantly extended
  survival. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a genetic mechanism by which pancreatic
  precursor lesions progress to invasive carcinomas and highlight DUSP4 as a novel
  invasion suppressor that can be therapeutically exploited through manipulation of
  ERK signaling. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2612-25. ï¿½2016 AACR.
