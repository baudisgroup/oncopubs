abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in the world. Nonetheless,
  the knowledge of the molecular events involved in the development of gastric carcinoma
  is far from complete. One of the hallmarks of gastric cancer is chromosomal instability
  resulting in abnormal DNA copy number changes throughout the genome. Mixed gastric
  carcinomas constitute a rare histological entity, containing the two main histological
  phenotypes diffuse and intestinal . Very little is known about the underlying mechanisms
  of phenotypic divergence in these mixed tumours. To the best of our knowledge only
  E-Cadherin mutations were implicated so far in the divergence of these tumours and
  nothing is known about the involvement of chromosome copy number changes in the
  two divergent histological components. In this study, we compared the DNA copy number
  changes, in the two different components diffuse and intestinal of mixed gastric
  carcinomas by microarray - comparative genomic hybridisation array CGH . The analysis
  of 12 mixed gastric carcinomas showed no significant differences in array CGH profiles
  between the diffuse and intestinal components of mixed carcinomas. This supports
  the idea that the phenotypic divergence within mixed gastric carcinomas is not caused
  by DNA chromosomal aberrations.
