abstract: Chromosomal instability is central to the process of carcinogenesis. The
  genome-wide detection of somatic chromosomal alterations (SCA) in small premalignant
  lesions remains challenging because sample heterogeneity dilutes the aberrant cell
  information. To overcome this hurdle, we focused on the B allele frequency data
  from single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP arrays). The difference of
  allelic fractions between paired tumor and normal samples from the same patient
  (delta-Î¸) provides a simple but sensitive detection of SCA in the affected tissue.
  We applied the delta-Î¸ approach to small, heterogeneous clinical specimens, including
  endobronchial biopsies and brushings. Regions identified by delta-Î¸ were validated
  by FISH and quantitative PCR in heterogeneous samples. Distinctive genomic variations
  were successfully detected across the whole genome in all invasive cancer cases
  (6 of 6), carcinoma in situ (3 of 3), and high-grade dysplasia (severe or moderate;
  3 of 11). Not only well-described SCAs in lung squamous cell carcinoma, but also
  several novel chromosomal alterations were frequently found across the preinvasive
  dysplastic cases. Within these novel regions, losses of putative tumor suppressors
  (RNF20 and SSBP2) and an amplification of RASGRP3 gene with oncogenic activity were
  observed. Widespread sampling of the airway during bronchoscopy demonstrated that
  field cancerization reflected by SCAs at multiple sites was detectable. SNP arrays
  combined with delta-Î¸ analysis can detect SCAs in heterogeneous clinical sample
  and expand our ability to assess genomic instability in the airway epithelium as
  a biomarker of lung cancer risk.
