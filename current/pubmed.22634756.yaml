abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related
  death worldwide. We sequenced and analyzed the whole genomes of 27 HCCs, 25 of which
  were associated with hepatitis B or C virus infections, including two sets of multicentric
  tumors. Although no common somatic mutations were identified in the multicentric
  tumor pairs, their whole-genome substitution patterns were similar, suggesting that
  these tumors developed from independent mutations, although their shared etiological
  backgrounds may have strongly influenced their somatic mutation patterns. Statistical
  and functional analyses yielded a list of recurrently mutated genes. Multiple chromatin
  regulators, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, MLL and MLL3, were mutated in 50 of
  the tumors. Hepatitis B virus genome integration in the TERT locus was frequently
  observed in a high clonal proportion. Our whole-genome sequencing analysis of HCCs
  identified the influence of etiological background on somatic mutation patterns
  and subsequent carcinogenesis, as well as recurrent mutations in chromatin regulators
  in HCCs.
