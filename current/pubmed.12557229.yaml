abstract: 'The underlying genetic events associated with follicular thyroid tumorigenesis
  are still ill defined. In this study, we performed a screening for chromosome imbalances
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH in a group of 12 follicular adenomas FAs
  and 20 follicular carcinomas FTCs previously characterized by conventional cytogenetics
  and flow cytometry analysis. In general, a great similarity was observed between
  the CGH profiles of the FAs and FTCs. In both benign and malignant tumors, a combination
  of gains affecting 5, 7, 12, 17, 19, and 20 was observed. Chromosome 7 was the most
  frequently affected chromosome, with three regions of consensus gains: 7p11-12,
  7q11.3-q21, and 7q31. Recurrent gains of chromosomes 5 and 12 involved 5p11, 5p15,
  5q13-q22, 5q21-q23, 12p11, and 12q11-q12. DNA sequence losses were also observed
  in both tumor groups. Chromosomal arms deleted in at least five of the neoplasms
  were in order of frequency : in adenomas, 15q, 2p 2q, 3q, 6p 6q, 11q, and 22q and
  in FTCs, 3p, 2p, 8q, 1p, 2q, 3q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 11q, 13q, 6p, and 18q. The statistical
  evaluation of the CGH data demonstrated that 15q loss was significantly associated
  with FA. Two regions of minimal common loss were defined by CGH at 15: 15q11-q21
  and 15q26-qter. The identification of these regions provides a basis for further
  molecular studies.'
