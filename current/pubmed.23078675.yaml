abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Epithelial ovarian cancer is characterized by multiple genomic
  alterations most are passenger alterations which do not confer tumor growth. Like
  many cancers, it is a heterogeneous disease and can be broadly categorized into
  4 main histotypes of clear cell, endometrioid, mucinous, and serous. To date, histotype-specific
  copy number alterations have been difficult to elucidate. The difficulty lies in
  having sufficient sample size in each histotype for statistical analyses. METHODS:
  To dissect the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer and identify histotype-specific alterations,
  we used an in silico hypothesis-driven approach on multiple datasets of epithelial
  ovarian cancer. RESULTS: In concordance with previous studies on global copy number
  alterations landscape, the study showed similar alterations. However, when the landscape
  was de-convoluted into histotypes, distinct alterations were observed. We report
  here significant histotype-specific copy number alterations in ovarian cancer and
  showed that there is genomic diversity amongst the histotypes. 76 cancer genes were
  found to be significantly altered with several as potential copy number drivers,
  including ERBB2 in mucinous, and TPM3 in endometrioid histotypes. ERBB2 was found
  to have preferential alterations, where it was amplified in mucinous 28.6 but deleted
  in serous tumors 15.1 . Validation of ERBB2 expression showed significant correlation
  with microarray data p 0.007 . There also appeared to be reciprocal relationship
  between KRAS mutation and copy number alterations. In mucinous tumors where KRAS
  mutation is common, the gene was not significantly altered. However, KRAS was significantly
  amplified in serous tumors where mutations are rare in high grade tumors. CONCLUSIONS:
  The study demonstrates that the copy number landscape is specific to the histotypes
  and identification of these alterations can pave the way for targeted drug therapy
  specific to the histotypes.'
