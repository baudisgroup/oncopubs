abstract: Eight pituitary adenomas four gonadotroph cell adenomas, three prolactin
  cell adenomas, one null cell adenoma and their respective recurrences in the same
  patients were studied by comparative genomic hybridization. Chromosomal imbalances
  were found in seven of eight patients affecting two of eight primary and seven of
  eight recurrent tumors. Overall, pituitary adenomas showed an average of 1.6 chromosomal
  imbalances per primary and 3.4 per recurrent tumor P amp lt 0.01 . Prolactin cell
  adenomas showed an average of 4.3 chromosomal changes per primary and 6.3 per recurrent
  tumor, which were significantly more common than in gonadotroph cell adenomas 0
  vs 1.7 changes P amp lt 0.05 and the null cell adenoma 0 vs 1.0 changes P amp lt
  0.05 . The most common changes were gains of 4q in three of eight recurrences ,
  5q, and 13q in two of eight recurrences each as well as losses of chromosome 2 in
  both primary and recurring tumors of two patients , 1p, 8q, 10, and 12q in two of
  eight recurrences . Minimal common regions associated with recurrent adenomas were
  gains of 4q31.2-34 three recurrences , 5q14-23 and 13q21-31 and losses of 12q24.3-qter
  two recurrences each . The average MIB-1 proliferation indices were 1.2 for primary
  and 1.9 for recurrent adenomas P amp lt 0.005 . Our findings suggest that acquisition
  of certain chromosomal imbalances is related to and may underlie adenoma recurrence.
