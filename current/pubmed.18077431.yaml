abstract: 'Comprehensive knowledge of the genomic alterations that underlie cancer
  is a critical foundation for diagnostics, prognostics, and targeted therapeutics.
  Systematic efforts to analyze cancer genomes are underway, but the analysis is hampered
  by the lack of a statistical framework to distinguish meaningful events from random
  background aberrations. Here we describe a systematic method, called Genomic Identification
  of Significant Targets in Cancer GISTIC , designed for analyzing chromosomal aberrations
  in cancer. We use it to study chromosomal aberrations in 141 gliomas and compare
  the results with two prior studies. Traditional methods highlight hundreds of altered
  regions with little concordance between studies. The new approach reveals a highly
  concordant picture involving approximately 35 significant events, including 16-18
  broad events near chromosome-arm size and 16-21 focal events. Approximately half
  of these events correspond to known cancer-related genes, only some of which have
  been previously tied to glioma. We also show that superimposed broad and focal events
  may have different biological consequences. Specifically, gliomas with broad amplification
  of chromosome 7 have properties different from those with overlapping focalEGFR
  amplification: the broad events act in part through effects on MET and its ligand
  HGF and correlate with MET dependence in vitro. Our results support the feasibility
  and utility of systematic characterization of the cancer genome.'
