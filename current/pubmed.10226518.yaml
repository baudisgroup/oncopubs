abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was applied to screen the genetic
  events in six invasive urinary bladder cancers. These cases were also studied by
  flow cytometry FCM and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . Four samples showed
  partial gain on chromosome 8, with the common region involved was on 8q23-qter.
  Full or partial deletion on chromosome 2 and 17p in addition to gain on 20q was
  found in two cases. Interestingly one diploid tumor with low mitotic index, stage
  and grade showed more genetic aberrations 8 gains and 7 losses by CGH than other
  aneuploid tumors with high mitotic index, stage and grade. The numerical chromosomal
  aberration detected by FISH for chromosomes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 17 were 50 in T1
  cases and 100 in T2-T4 cases. FISH was performed on chromosome 8q and 17p to compare
  and validate the sensitivity of CGH. The agreement was 100 for 8q24 locus and 50
  for p53 locus. This indicates that different molecular genetic techniques showed
  relatively different aspect of genomic aberrations.
