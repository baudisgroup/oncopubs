abstract: 'Fourteen malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs , characterized
  by immunohistochemistry, were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . The most striking feature was the detection of consistent DNA losses on the short
  arm of chromosome 1 in these 14 malignant tumors. Additional recurrent imbalances
  were also found: significant gains, which could be indicative of tumor progression,
  were frequent on the long arm of chromosome 1, as were losses of DNA copy number
  detected in chromosomes 13, 14, 15 and 22.'
