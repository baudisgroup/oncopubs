abstract: 'In the quest for new targets, genomes of ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS
  and infiltrating duct carcinoma IDC have been compared previously however, genomic
  alterations associated with cancer progression were difficult to identify. We hypothesized
  that significant events can be detected by comparing lesions with a broader range
  of behavior: from pure DCIS to IDC associated with lymph node metastasis.'
