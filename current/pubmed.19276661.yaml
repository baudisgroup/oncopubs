abstract: The Cub and Sushi Multiple Domains-1 CSMD1 is a tumor suppressor gene on
  8p23.2, where allelic loss is both frequent and associated with poor prognosis in
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC . To understand the extent of CSMD1
  aberrations in vivo, we characterized 184 primary tumors from the head and neck,
  lung, breast and skin for gene copy number and analyzed expression in our HNSCCs
  and lung squamous cell carcinomas SCCs . We detected loss of CSMD1 in a large proportion
  of HNSCCs 50 , lung 46 and breast cancers 55 , and to a lesser extent in cutaneous
  SCCs 29 and basal cell carcinomas BCCs, 17 using array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH . Studying the region more closely with quantitative real-time
  PCR qPCR , the loss of CSMD1 increased to 80 in HNSCCs and 93 in lung SCCs. CSMD1
  expression was decreased in tumors compared to adjacent benign tissue 65 , 13 20
  and was likely due to gene loss in 45 of cases 9 20 . We also identified truncated
  transcripts lacking exons due to DNA copy number loss 30 , 5 17 or aberrant splicing
  24 , 4 17 . We show loss of CSMD1 in primary HNSCC tissues, and document for the
  first time that CSMD1 is lost in breast, lung and cutaneous SCCs. We also show that
  deletions of CSMD1 and aberrant splicing contribute to altered CSMD1 function in
  vivo.
