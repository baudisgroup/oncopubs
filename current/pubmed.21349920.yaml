abstract: The recently described DNA replication-based mechanisms of fork stalling
  and template switching FoSTeS and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication
  MMBIR were previously shown to catalyze complex exonic, genic and genomic rearrangements.
  By analyzing a large number of isochromosomes of the long arm of chromosome X i
  Xq , using whole-genome tiling path array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH
  , ultra-high resolution targeted aCGH and sequencing, we provide evidence that the
  FoSTeS and MMBIR mechanisms can generate large-scale gross chromosomal rearrangements
  leading to the deletion and duplication of entire chromosome arms, thus suggesting
  an important role for DNA replication-based mechanisms in both the development of
  genomic disorders and cancer. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanisms of dicentric
  i Xq idic Xq formation and show that most idic Xq chromosomes result from non-allelic
  homologous recombination between palindromic low copy repeats and highly homologous
  palindromic LINE elements. We also show that non-recurrent-breakpoint idic Xq chromosomes
  have microhomology-associated breakpoint junctions and are likely catalyzed by microhomology-mediated
  replication-dependent recombination mechanisms such as FoSTeS and MMBIR. Finally,
  we stress the role of the proximal Xp region as a chromosomal rearrangement hotspot.
