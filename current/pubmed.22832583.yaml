abstract: Medulloblastoma is an aggressively growing tumour, arising in the cerebellum
  or medulla brain stem. It is the most common malignant brain tumour in children,
  and shows tremendous biological and clinical heterogeneity. Despite recent treatment
  advances, approximately 40 of children experience tumour recurrence, and 30 will
  die from their disease. Those who survive often have a significantly reduced quality
  of life. Four tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic profiles
  are currently identified. WNT tumours, showing activated wingless pathway signalling,
  carry a favourable prognosis under current treatment regimens. SHH tumours show
  hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis. Group 3 and 4 tumours
  are molecularly less well characterized, and also present the greatest clinical
  challenges. The full repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however,
  remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing analysis of 125
  tumour-normal pairs, conducted as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium
  ICGC PedBrain Tumor Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event
  in Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between patient age and mutation
  rate was observed. Several recurrent mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related
  genes CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 and in genes not previously linked to this tumour
  DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1 , often in subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing
  confirmed these alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our knowledge,
  the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified. Chromatin modifiers were frequently
  altered across all subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the genomic
  complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma, and provide several potential
  targets for new therapeutics, especially for Group 3 and 4 patients.
