abstract: Several copy number-altered regions CNAs have been identified in the genome
  of cervical cancer, notably, amplifications of 3q and 5p. However, the contribution
  of copy-number alterations to cervical carcinogenesis is unresolved because genome-wide
  there exists a lack of correlation between copy-number alterations and gene expression.
  In this study, we investigated whether CNAs in the cell lines CaLo, CaSki, HeLa,
  and SiHa were associated with changes in gene expression. On average, 19.2 of the
  cell-line genomes had CNAs. However, only 2.4 comprised minimal recurrent regions
  MRRs common to all the cell lines. Whereas 3q had limited common gains 13 , 5p was
  entirely duplicated recurrently. Genome-wide, only 15.6 of genes located in CNAs
  changed gene expression in contrast, the rate in MRRs was up to 3 times this. Chr
  5p was confirmed entirely amplified by FISH however, maximum 33.5 of the explored
  genes in 5p were deregulated. In 3q, this rate was 13.4 . Even in 3q26, which had
  5 MRRs and 38.7 recurrently gained SNPs, the rate was only 15.1 . Interestingly,
  up to 19 of deregulated genes in 5p and 73 in 3q26 were downregulated, suggesting
  additional factors were involved in gene repression. The deregulated genes in 3q
  and 5p occurred in clusters, suggesting local chromatin factors may also influence
  gene expression. In regions amplified discontinuously, downregulated genes increased
  steadily as the number of amplified SNPs increased p lt 0.01, Spearmans correlation
  . Therefore, partial gene amplification may function in silencing gene expression.
  Additional genes in 1q, 3q and 5p could be involved in cervical carcinogenesis,
  specifically in apoptosis. These include PARP1 in 1q, TNFSF10 and ECT2 in 3q and
  CLPTM1L, AHRR, PDCD6, and DAP in 5p. Overall, gene expression and copy-number profiles
  reveal factors other than gene dosage, like epigenetic or chromatin domains, may
  influence gene expression within the entirely amplified genome segments.
