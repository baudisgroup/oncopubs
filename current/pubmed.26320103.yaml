abstract: 'One of the major consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident was
  a dramatic increase in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) incidence, predominantly
  in patients exposed to the radioiodine fallout at young age. The present study is
  the first on genomic copy number alterations (CNAs) of PTCs of the Ukrainian American
  cohort (UkrAm) generated by Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH). Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering of CNA profiles revealed a significant enrichment of a subgroup
  of patients with female gender, long latency (> 17 years) and negative lymph node
  status. Further, we identified single CNAs that were significantly associated with
  latency, gender, radiation dose and BRAF status. Multivariate analysis revealed
  no interactions but additive effects of parameters gender, latency and dose on CNAs.
  The previously identified radiation-associated gain of the chromosomal bands 7q11.22-11.23
  was present in 29% of cases. Moreover, comparison of our radiation-associated papillary
  thyroid carcinoma (PTC) data set with the TCGA data set on sporadic PTCs revealed
  altered copy numbers of the tumor driver genes NF2 and CHEK2. Further, we integrated
  the CNA data with transcriptomic data that were available on a subset of the herein
  analyzed cohort and did not find statistically significant associations between
  the two molecular layers. However, applying hierarchical clustering on a "BRAF-like/RAS-like"
  transcriptome signature split the cases into four groups, one of which containing
  all BRAF-positive cases validating the signature in an independent data set.  ï¿½
