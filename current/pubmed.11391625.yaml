abstract: Little is known about the prognostic impact of chromosome aberrations in
  breast cancer. The aim of our study was to determine whether genomic aberrations
  of prognostic relevance can be identified in the context of a clinical study using
  molecular cytogenetics. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 44 patients with high-risk
  stage II III breast cancer were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. All
  patients received identical therapy including dose-escalated chemotherapy followed
  by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The most frequent chromosomal aberrations
  were gains on chromosome arms 17q 24 cases , 1q 21 cases , 8q 17 cases , 20q 13
  cases , 6p 9 cases as well as losses on chromosome arms 13q 25 cases , 11q 20 cases
  , 5q 11 cases , 6q 11 cases , 9p 10 cases , 18q 10 cases , 8p 9 cases and 16q 9
  cases . In univariate analysis, the correlation with the clinical outcome revealed
  a higher risk for patients with tumors exhibiting 13q losses and a reduced risk
  for tumors exhibiting 16q losses p 0.020 , 6q losses p 0.041 and estrogen-receptor
  positivity 0.051 . In multivariate analysis using the Cox model, only the loss of
  16q exhibited borderline significance p 0.065 . These data show that comparative
  genomic hybridization can be performed in the context of a clinical trial. In our
  subgroup of high-risk breast cancer patients, chromosomal aberrations were valuable
  prognostic parameters.
