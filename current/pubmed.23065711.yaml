abstract: We identified a novel prognostic biomarker for the distant metastasis of
  colorectal cancer CRC using comprehensive combined copy number and gene expression
  analyses. Expression of mRNA in CRC tissue was profiled in 115 patients using an
  Affymetrix Gene Chip, and copy number profiles were generated for 122 patients using
  an Affymetrix 250K Sty array. Genes showing both upregulated expression and copy
  number gains in cases involving distant CRC metastasis were extracted as candidate
  biomarkers. Expression of the candidate gene mRNA was validated in 86 patients using
  quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Expression
  of the protein encoded by the candidate gene was assessed using immunohistochemical
  staining of tissue from 269 patients. The relationship between protein expression
  and clinicopathologic features was also examined. Following combined copy number
  and gene expression analyses, three genes linked to distant metastasis of CRC were
  extracted as candidate biomarkers. The expression of NUCKS1, reportedly overexpressed
  in several cancers other than CRC, was significantly higher in CRC tissue than in
  normal tissue. Overexpression of the NUCKS1 protein in CRC cells was found to be
  associated with significantly worse overall survival and relapse-free survival,
  indicating that NUCKS1 is an independent risk factor for CRC recurrence. The overexpression
  of NUCKS1 in cancer cells could be used as a CRC prognostic marker and might also
  be a target for treatment of this disease.
