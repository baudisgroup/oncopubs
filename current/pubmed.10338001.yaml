abstract: To investigate the genomic imbalances associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  NPC , we have performed chromosome analysis by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH on 51 tumors, including 25 primary and 26 recurrent tumors. The most common
  copy number increases occurred on chromosome arms 12p 59 , 1q 47 , 17q 47 , 11q
  41 , and 12q 35 . The minimal overlapping regions were at 12p12-13, 1q21-22, 17q21,
  17q25, 11q13, and 12q13. The most frequent losses were from chromosome arms 3p 53
  , 9p 41 , 13q 41 , 14q 35 , and 11q 29 . The minimal overlapping regions were at
  3p12-14, 3p25-26, 9p21-23, 13q21-32, 14q12-21, and 11q14-23. Compared with the primary
  cancers, no additional chromosomal change was found in the recurrent tumors however,
  the most frequent gain in the recurrent NPCs was at 11q13 53 instead of 12p in the
  primary tumors. An increase of gene alterations correlated with clinical stage.
  Our results provide a first comprehensive view of the genomic changes associated
  with NPC and reveal several new sites of genomic imbalance, indicating the possible
  involvement of novel oncogenes tumor suppressor genes in the carcinogenesis of NPC.
