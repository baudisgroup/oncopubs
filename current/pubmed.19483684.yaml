abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes MDS represent a heterogeneous group of neoplastic
  hematopoietic disorders. Several recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been associated
  with MDS, but the genes affected have remained largely unknown. To identify relevant
  genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, we conducted SNP array-based
  genomic profiling and genomic sequencing in 102 individuals with MDS and identified
  acquired deletions and missense and nonsense mutations in the TET2 gene in 26 of
  these individuals. Using allele-specific assays, we detected TET2 mutations in most
  of the bone marrow cells median 96 . In addition, the mutations were encountered
  in various lineages of differentiation including CD34 progenitor cells, suggesting
  that TET2 mutations occur early during disease evolution. In healthy tissues, TET2
  expression was shown to be elevated in hematopoietic cells with highest expression
  in granulocytes, in line with a function in myelopoiesis. We conclude that TET2
  is the most frequently mutated gene in MDS known so far.
