abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is an aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphoma with median
  patient survival times of approximately 3 years. Although the characteristic t 11
  14 q13 q32 is found in virtually all cases, experimental evidence suggests that
  this event alone is insufficient to result in lymphoma and secondary genomic alterations
  are required. Using a newly developed DNA microarray of 32 433 overlapping genomic
  segments spanning the entire human genome, we can for the first time move beyond
  marker based analysis and comprehensively search for secondary genomic alterations
  concomitant with the t 11 14 in eight commonly used cell models of MCL Granta-519,
  HBL-2, NCEB-1, Rec-1, SP49, UPN-1, Z138C and JVM-2 . Examining these genomes at
  tiling resolution identified an unexpected average of 35 genetic alterations per
  cell line, with equal numbers of amplifications and deletions. Recurrent high-level
  amplifications were identified at 18q21 containing BCL2, and at 13q31 containing
  GPC5. In addition, a recurrent homozygous deletion was identified at 9p21 containing
  p15 and p16. Alignment of these profiles revealed 14 recurrent losses and 21 recurrent
  gains as small as 130 kb. Remarkably, even the intra immunoglobulin gene deletions
  at 2p11 and 22q11 were detected, demonstrating the power of combining the detection
  sensitivity of array comparative genomic hybridization CGH with the resolution of
  an overlapping whole genome tiling-set. These alterations not only coincided with
  previously described aberrations in MCL, but also defined 13 novel regions. Further
  characterization of such minimally altered genomic regions identified using whole
  genome array CGH will define novel dominant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
  that play important roles in the pathogenesis of MCL.
