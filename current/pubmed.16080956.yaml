abstract: Chromosomal instability, manifesting as copy number alterations CNAs , is
  characteristic of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We used bacterial artificial chromosome
  BAC array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to examine the pancreatic
  adenocarcinoma genome for submicroscopic amplifications and deletions. Profiles
  of 33 samples 17 first-passage xenografts and 16 cell lines identified numerous
  chromosomal regions with CNAs, including losses at 1p36.33 approximately p34.3,
  1p13.3 approximately p13.2, 3p26, 3p25.2 approximately p22.3, 3p22.1 approximately
  p14.1, 4q28.3, 4q31, 4q35.1, 5q14.3, 6p, 6q, 8p23.3 approximately p12, 9p, 9q22.32
  approximately q31.1, 13q33.2, 15q11.2, 16p13.3, 17p, 18q11.21 approximately q23
  , 19p13.3 approximately p13.12, 19q13.2, 21p, 21q, and 22p, 22q and gains at 7p21.1
  approximately p11.2, 7q31.32, 7q33, 8q11.1 approximately q24, 11p13, 14q22.2, 20p12.2,
  and 20q11.23 approximately q13.33. Novel regions containing CNAs were identified
  and refined by combining the increased resolution of our BAC CGH array with a statistical
  algorithm developed for assigning significance values to altered BACs across samples.
  A subset of array-based CNAs was validated using polymerase chain reaction-based
  techniques, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. BAC aCGH
  proved to be a powerful genome-wide strategy to identify molecular alterations in
  pancreatic cancer and to distinguish differences between cell line and xenograft
  aberration profiles. These findings should greatly facilitate further research in
  understanding the pathogenesis of this lethal disease, and could lead to the identification
  of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for early detection.
