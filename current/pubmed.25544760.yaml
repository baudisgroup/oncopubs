abstract: "Melanoma is often caused by mutations due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
  This study reports a recurrent somatic C > T change causing a P131L mutation in
  the RQCD1 (Required for Cell Differentiation1 Homolog) gene identified through whole
  exome sequencing of 20 metastatic melanomas. Screening in 715 additional primary
  melanomas revealed a prevalence of ~4%. This represents the first reported recurrent
  mutation in a member of the CCR4-NOT complex in cancer. Compared to tumors without
  the mutation, the P131L mutant positive tumors were associated with increased thickness
  (p = 0.02), head and neck (p = 0.009) and upper limb (p = 0.03) location, lentigo
  maligna melanoma subtype (p = 0.02) and BRAF V600K (p = 0.04) but not V600E or NRAS
  codon 61 mutations. There was no association with nodal disease (p = 0.3). Mutually
  exclusive mutations of other members of the CCR4-NOT complex were found in ~20%
  of the TCGA melanoma dataset suggesting the complex may play an important role in
  melanoma biology. Mutant RQCD1 was predicted to bind strongly to HLA-A0201 and HLA-Cw3
  MHC1 complexes. From thirteen patients with mutant RQCD1, an anti-tumor CD8â\x81º
  T cell response was observed from a single patient's peripheral blood mononuclear
  cell population stimulated with mutated peptide compared to wildtype indicating
  a neoantigen may be formed."
