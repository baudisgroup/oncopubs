abstract: Symptomatic craniospinal dissemination of glioblastomas is considered rare,
  and unambiguous pathologic or molecular predictors of tumor leptomeningeal spread
  remain to be defined. We performed molecular analysis of 8 glioblastomas with symptomatic
  leptomeningeal dissemination by using fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH . The most frequently encountered alteration
  was gain of the 1p36 locus, which was found in all 8 samples examined. Array-CGH
  analysis of 3 available samples also disclosed numerous gains at the 1pter-p36.1
  locus involving at least 3 DNA clones from this chromosomal region. Consequently,
  an analysis of 1p copy number status might be kept in mind as an additional tool
  for further predicting the clinical course of glioblastoma.
