abstract: In this study, we used comparative genomic hybridization to provide an overview
  of chromosomal imbalances in a series of 20 adult and 8 childhood ependymomas. All
  tumors displayed multiple genomic imbalances. Loss of genetic material was observed
  in chromosomes 22q 71 , 16 57 , 17 46 , 6 39 , 19q 32 , 20q 32 , and 1p 29 , with
  the overlapped deletion regions determined at 16p13.1-13.3, 16q22-q24, 19q13.1-13.4,
  20q13.1-13.2 and 1p36.1-36.3. Gain of DNA was commonly detected on chromosomes 5q
  46 , 12q 39 , 7q 36 , 9q 36 , and 4q 32 , with overlapped regions of gain mapped
  to 5q21-22, 12q15-24.1, 7q11.2-31.2, 9q12-32, and 4q23-28, respectively. These findings
  suggest a greater degree of genomic imbalance in ependymomas than has been recognized
  previously and highlight chromosomal loci likely to contain oncogenes or tumor suppressor
  genes that may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor. Our study
  also confirmed previous findings on frequent losses of 17 and 22q in ependymomas
  and further identified chromosome 16 loss as a common recurrent genetic aberration
  in ependymomas.
