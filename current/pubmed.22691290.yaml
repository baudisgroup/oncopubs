abstract: Li-Fraumeni LFS and Li-Fraumeni-like LFL syndromes are associated to germline
  TP53 mutations, and are characterized by the development of central nervous system
  tumors, sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and other early-onset tumors. Due to
  the high frequency of breast cancer in LFS LFL families, these syndromes clinically
  overlap with hereditary breast cancer HBC . Germline point mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2,
  and TP53 genes are associated with high risk of breast cancer. Large rearrangements
  involving these genes are also implicated in the HBC phenotype.
