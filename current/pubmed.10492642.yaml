abstract: The elucidation of the genetic changes of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is
  very important for understanding the molecular mechanism of liver carcinogenesis.
  In order to identify the gains or losses in DNA sequence copy number in HCC, we
  used comparative genomic hybridisation to study 40 cases 44 tumours of HCC. Tumour
  DNA and DNA from non-neoplastic liver tissue were labelled with different fluorochromes
  and then simultaneously hybridised to normal metaphase spread chromosomes. An image
  acquisition system was used to quantitate signal intensities contributed by tumour
  and reference DNA along the entire length of each chromosome. Regions of amplification
  and deletion were demonstrated as quantitative alterations. Losses were prevalent
  on chromosome regions 16q 43 , 17p 20 , 13q 20 , 4q 15 and 8p 15 . Gains frequently
  occurred on 8q 30 , 1q 20 , 6p 20 and 17q 18 . Hepatitis B virus carriers had a
  significantly higher frequency of losses on chromosome 16q. Furthermore, the minimal
  region of losses was narrowed down to 16q11-q22. This study confirms the presence
  of previously known chromosomal aberrations in HCC and highlights a new significant
  correlation between losses on chromosome 16q and hepatitis B virus carriers.
