abstract: 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by specific patterns of copy number
  alterations (CNAs), which helped with the identification of driver oncogenes and
  tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). More recently, the usage of single nucleotide polymorphism
  arrays provided information of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity, thus
  suggesting the occurrence of somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) and uniparental polysomy
  (UPP) events. The aim of this study is to establish an integrative profiling of
  recurrent UPDs/UPPs and CNAs in sporadic CRC. Our results indicate that regions
  showing high frequencies of UPD/UPP mostly coincide with regions typically involved
  in genomic losses. Among them, chromosome arms 3p, 5q, 9q, 10q, 14q, 17p, 17q, 20p,
  21q and 22q preferentially showed UPDs/UPPs over genomic losses suggesting that
  tumor cells must maintain the disomic state of certain genes to favor cellular fitness.
  A meta-analysis using over 300 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed our
  findings. Several regions affected by recurrent UPDs/UPPs contain well-known TSGs,
  as well as novel candidates such as ARID1A, DLC1, TCF7L2 and DMBT1. In addition,
  VCAN, FLT4, SFRP1 and GAS7 were also frequently involved in regions of UPD/UPP and
  displayed high levels of methylation. Finally, sequencing and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization analysis of the gene APC underlined that a somatic UPD event might
  represent the second hit to achieve biallelic inactivation of this TSG in colorectal
  tumors. In summary, our data define a profile of somatic UPDs/UPPs in sporadic CRC
  and highlights the importance of these events as a mechanism to achieve the inactivation
  of TSGs.  ï¿½ The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights
