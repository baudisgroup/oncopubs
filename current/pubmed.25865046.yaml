abstract: Small intestinal carcinoids are rare and difficult to diagnose and patients
  often present with advanced incurable disease. Although the disease occurs sporadically,
  there have been reports of family clusters. Hereditary small intestinal carcinoid
  has not been recognized and genetic factors have not been identified. We performed
  aï¿½genetic analysis of families with small intestinal carcinoids to establish a
  hereditary basis and find genes that might cause this cancer.  We performed a prospective
  study of 33 families with at least 2 cases of small intestinal carcinoids. Affected
  members were characterized clinically and asymptomatic relatives were screened and
  underwent exploratoryï¿½laparotomy for suspected tumors. Disease-associated mutations
  were sought using linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and copy number analyses
  of germline and tumor DNA collected from members of a single large family. We assessed
  expression of mutant protein, protein activity, and regulation of apoptosis and
  senescence in lymphoblasts derived from the cases.  Familial and sporadic carcinoids
  are clinically indistinguishable except for the multiple synchronous primary tumors
  observed in most familial cases. Nearly 34% of asymptomatic relatives older than
  age 50 were found to have occult tumors; the tumors were cleared surgically from
  91% of these individuals (21 of 23). Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing
  identified aï¿½germline 4-bp deletion in the gene inositol polyphosphateï¿½multikinase
  (IPMK), which truncates the protein. This mutation was detected in all 11 individuals
  with small intestinal carcinoids and in 17 of 35 family members whose carcinoid
  status was unknown. Mutant IPMK had reduced kinase activity and nuclear localization,
  compared with the full-length protein. This reduced activation of p53 and increased
  cell survival.  We found that small intestinal carcinoids can occur as an inherited
  autosomal-dominant disease. The familial form is characterized by multiple synchronous
  primary tumors, which might account for 22%-35% of cases previously considered sporadic.
  Relatives of patients with familialï¿½carcinoids should be screened to detect curable
  early stageï¿½disease. IPMK haploinsufficiency promotes carcinoid tumorigenesis.  Copyright
