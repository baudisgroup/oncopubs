abstract: Propensity for subsequent distant metastasis in head and neck squamous-cell
  carcinoma HNSCC was analysed using 186 primary tumours from patients initially treated
  by surgery that developed M or did not develop NM metastases as the first recurrent
  event. Transcriptome Affymetrix HGU133_Plus2, QRT-PCR and array-comparative genomic
  hybridization data were collected. Non-supervised hierarchical clustering based
  on Affymetrix data distinguished tumours differing in pathological differentiation,
  and identified associated functional changes. Propensity for metastasis was not
  associated with these subgroups. Using QRT-PCR data we identified a four-gene model
  PSMD10, HSD17B12, FLOT2 and KRT17 that predicts M NM status with 77 success in a
  separate 79-sample validation group of HNSCC samples. This prediction is independent
  of clinical criteria age, lymph node status, stage, differentiation and localization
  . The most significantly altered transcripts in M versus NM were significantly associated
  to metastasis-related functions, including adhesion, mobility and cell survival.
  Several genomic modifications were significantly associated with M NM status most
  notably gains at 4q11-22 and Xq12-28 losses at 11q14-24 and 17q11 losses and partly
  linked to transcription modifications. This work yields a basis for the development
  of prognostic molecular signatures, markers and therapeutic targets for HNSCC metastasis.
