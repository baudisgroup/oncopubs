abstract: We describe a statistical method for the characterization of genomic aberrations
  in single nucleotide polymorphism microarray data acquired from cancer genomes.
  Our approach allows us to model the joint effect of polyploidy, normal DNA contamination
  and intra-tumour heterogeneity within a single unified Bayesian framework. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method on numerous datasets including laboratory generated mixtures
  of normal-cancer cell lines and real primary tumours.
