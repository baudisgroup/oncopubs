abstract: Chromosome 13q14 deletion occurs in a substantial number of chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL patients and it is believed to play a pathogenetic role. The exact
  mechanisms involved in this lesion have not yet been fully elucidated because of
  its heterogeneity and the imprecise knowledge of the implicated genes. This study
  was addressed to further contribute to the molecular definition of this lesion in
  CLL.
