abstract: Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma ATLL is an HTLV-1-associated lymphoproliferative
  malignancy that is frequently fatal. We compared gene expression profiles GEPs of
  leukemic specimens from nine patients with ATLL at the time of diagnosis and immediately
  after combination therapy with zidovudine AZT and interferon alpha IFNalpha . GEPs
  were also related to genetic aberrations determined by comparative genomic hybridization.
  We identified several genes anomalously over-expressed in the ATLL leukemic cells
  at the mRNA level, including LYN, CSPG2, and LMO2, and confirmed LMO2 expression
  in ATLL cells at the protein level. In vivo AZT-IFNalpha therapy evoked a marked
  induction of interferon-induced genes accompanied by repression of cell-cycle regulated
  genes, including those encoding ribosomal proteins. Remarkably, patients not responding
  to AZT-IFNalpha differed most from responding patients in lower expression of these
  same IFN-responsive genes, as well as components of the antigen processing and presentation
  apparatus. Demonstration of specific gene expression signatures associated with
  response to AZT-IFNalpha therapy may provide novel insights into the mechanisms
  of action in ATLL.
