abstract: Epidemiological data have suggested that African American (AA) persons are
  twice as likely to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) compared with European
  American (EA) persons. Here, we have analyzed a set of cytogenetic and genomic data
  derived from AA and EA MM patients. We have compared the frequency of IgH translocations
  in a series of data from 115 AA patients from 3 studies and 353 EA patients from
  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies E4A03 and E9487. We have also
  interrogated tumors from 45 AA and 196 EA MM patients for somatic copy number abnormalities
  associated with poor outcome. In addition, 35 AA and 178 EA patients were investigated
  for a transcriptional profile associated with high-risk disease. Overall, based
  on this cohort, genetic profiles were similar except for a significantly lower frequency
  of IgH translocations (40% vs 52%; P = .032) in AA patients. Frequency differences
  of somatic copy number aberrations were not significant after correction for multiple
  testing. There was also no significant difference in the frequency of high-risk
  disease based on gene expression profiling. Our study represents the first comprehensive
  comparisons of the frequency and distribution of molecular alterations in MM tumors
  between AA and EA patients. ECOG E4A03 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
  NCT00098475. ECOG E9487 is a companion validation set to the ECOG study E9486 and
  is registered with the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute,
  Clinical Trials (PDQ), number EST-9486.
