abstract: We correlate chromosomal changes in medulloblastomas with histologic subtype,
  reporting the analysis of 33 medulloblastoma specimens by comparative genomic hybridization,
  and a subset by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Of the 33 tumors, 5 were desmoplastic
  nodular, 10 were histologically classic, and 18 were large cell anaplastic. Chromosomal
  gains and losses were more common in anaplastic medulloblastomas than in non-anaplastic
  ones. We identified 4 medulloblastomas with c-myc amplification and 5 medulloblastomas
  with N-myc amplification all 9 were of the large cell anaplastic subtype. Additional
  regions with high level gains included 2q14-22, 3p23, 5p14-pter, 8q24, 9p22-23,
  10p12-pter, 12q24, 12p11-12, 17p11-12, and Xp11. The majority of these high level
  gains occurred in anaplastic cases. We also found loss of chromosome 17p in 7 large
  cell anaplastic cases but no nonanaplastic medulloblastomas. Finally, we detected
  a significantly increased overall number of chromosomal alterations in large cell
  anaplastic medulloblastomas 6.8 case compared to non-anaplastic ones 3.3 case .
  These findings support an association between myc oncogene amplification, 17p loss,
  and large cell anaplastic histology.
