abstract: To characterize patterns of global transcriptional deregulation in primary
  colon carcinomas, we did gene expression profiling of 73 tumors Unio Internationale
  Contra Cancrum stage II n 33 and stage III n 40 using oligonucleotide microarrays.
  For 30 of the tumors, expression profiles were compared with those from matched
  normal mucosa samples. We identified a set of 1,950 genes with highly significant
  deregulation between tumors and mucosa samples P amp lt 1e-7 . A significant proportion
  of these genes mapped to chromosome 20 P 0.01 . Seventeen genes had a amp gt 5-fold
  average expression difference between normal colon mucosa and carcinomas, including
  up-regulation of MYC and of HMGA1, a putative oncogene. Furthermore, we identified
  68 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between lymph node-negative
  and lymph node-positive tumors P amp lt 0.001 , the functional annotation of which
  revealed a preponderance of genes that play a role in cellular immune response and
  surveillance. The microarray-derived gene expression levels of 20 deregulated genes
  were validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR in amp gt
  40 tumor and normal mucosa samples with good concordance between the techniques.
  Finally, we established a relationship between specific genomic imbalances, which
  were mapped for 32 of the analyzed colon tumors by comparative genomic hybridization,
  and alterations of global transcriptional activity. Previously, we had conducted
  a similar analysis of primary rectal carcinomas. The systematic comparison of colon
  and rectal carcinomas revealed a significant overlap of genomic imbalances and transcriptional
  deregulation, including activation of the Wnt beta-catenin signaling cascade, suggesting
  similar pathogenic pathways.
