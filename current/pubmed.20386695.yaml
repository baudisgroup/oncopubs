abstract: Ovarian cancer is a disease characterised by complex genomic rearrangements
  but the majority of the genes that are the target of these alterations remain unidentified.
  Cataloguing these target genes will provide useful insights into the disease etiology
  and may provide an opportunity to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
  High resolution genome wide copy number and matching expression data from 68 primary
  epithelial ovarian carcinomas of various histotypes was integrated to identify genes
  in regions of most frequent amplification with the strongest correlation with expression
  and copy number. Regions on chromosomes 3, 7, 8, and 20 were most frequently increased
  in copy number amp gt 40 of samples . Within these regions, 703 1370 51 unique gene
  expression probesets were differentially expressed when samples with gain were compared
  to samples without gain. 30 of these differentially expressed probesets also showed
  a strong positive correlation r amp gt or 0.6 between expression and copy number.
  We also identified 21 regions of high amplitude copy number gain, in which 32 known
  protein coding genes showed a strong positive correlation between expression and
  copy number. Overall, our data validates previously known ovarian cancer genes,
  such as ERBB2, and also identified novel potential drivers such as MYNN, PUF60 and
  TPX2.
