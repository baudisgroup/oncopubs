abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH is a powerful tool for detecting
  DNA copy number alterations CNA . Because diffuse malignant gliomas are often sampled
  by small biopsies, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE blocks are often the only
  tissue available for genetic analysis FFPE tissues are also needed to study the
  intratumoral heterogeneity that characterizes these neoplasms. In this paper, we
  present a combination of evaluations and technical advances that provide strong
  support for the ready use of oligonucleotide aCGH on FFPE diffuse gliomas. We first
  compared aCGH using bacterial artificial chromosome BAC arrays in 45 paired frozen
  and FFPE gliomas, and demonstrate a high concordance rate between FFPE and frozen
  DNA in an individual clone-level analysis of sensitivity and specificity, assuring
  that under certain array conditions, frozen and FFPE DNA can perform nearly identically.
  However, because oligonucleotide arrays offer advantages to BAC arrays in genomic
  coverage and practical availability, we next developed a method of labeling DNA
  from FFPE tissue that allows efficient hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays.
  To demonstrate utility in FFPE tissues, we applied this approach to biphasic anaplastic
  oligoastrocytomas and demonstrate CNA differences between DNA obtained from the
  two components. Therefore, BAC and oligonucleotide aCGH can be sensitive and specific
  tools for detecting CNAs in FFPE DNA, and novel labeling techniques enable the routine
  use of oligonucleotide arrays for FFPE DNA. In combination, these advances should
  facilitate genome-wide analysis of rare, small and or histologically heterogeneous
  gliomas from FFPE tissues.
