abstract: While new defects in BRCA1 are still being found, it is unclear whether
  current breast cancer diagnostics misses many BRCA1-associated cases. A reliable
  test that is able to indicate the involvement of BRCA1 deficiency in cancer genesis
  could support decision making in genetic counselling and clinical management. To
  find BRCA1-specific markers and explore the effectiveness of the current diagnostic
  strategy, we designed a classification method, validated it and examined whether
  we could find BRCA1-like breast tumours in a group of patients initially diagnosed
  as non-BRCA1 2 mutation carriers.
