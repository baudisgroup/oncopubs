abstract: Chromosomal abnormalities are important for the classification and risk
  stratification of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . However, approximately
  30 of childhood and 50 of adult patients lack abnormalities with clinical relevance.
  Here, we describe the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH
  to identify copy number alterations CNA in 58 ALL patients. CNA were identified
  in 83 of cases, and most frequently involved chromosomes 21 n 42 , 9 n 21 , 6 n
  16 , 12 n 11 , 15 n 11 , 8 n 10 and 17 n 10 . Deletions of 6q del 6q were heterogeneous
  in size, in agreement with previous data, demonstrating the sensitivity of aCGH
  to measure CNA. Although 9p deletions showed considerable variability in both the
  extent and location, all encompassed the CDKN2A locus. Six patients showed del 12p
  , with a common region encompassing the ETV6 gene. Complex CNA were observed involving
  chromosomes 6 n 2 , 15 n 2 and 21 n 11 with multiple regions of loss and gain along
  each chromosome. Chromosome 21 CNA shared a common region of gain, with associated
  subtelomeric deletions. Other recurrent findings included dim 13q , dim 16q and
  enh 17q . This is the first report of genome-wide detection of CNA in ALL patients
  using aCGH, and it has demonstrated a higher level of karyotype complexity than
  anticipated from conventional cytogenetic analysis.
