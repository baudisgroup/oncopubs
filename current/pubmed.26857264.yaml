abstract: Gastric cancer and esophageal cancer are the second and sixth leading causes
  of cancer-related death worldwide. Multiple genomic alterations underlying gastric
  cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have been identified, but the
  full spectrum of genomic structural variations and mutations have yet to be uncovered.
  Here, we report the results of whole-genome sequencing of 30 samples comprising
  tumor and blood from 15 patients, four of whom presented with ESCC, seven with gastric
  cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and four with gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma. Analyses
  revealed that an A>C mutation was common in GCA, and in addition to the preferential
  nucleotide sequence of A located 5 prime to the mutation as noted in previous studies,
  we found enrichment of T in the 5 prime base. The A>C mutations in GCA suggested
  that oxidation of guanine may be a potential mechanism underlying cancer mutagenesis.
  Furthermore, we identified genes with mutations in gastric cancer and ESCC, including
  well-known cancer genes, TP53, JAK3, BRCA2, FGF2, FBXW7, MSH3, PTCH, NF1, ERBB2,
  and CHEK2, and potentially novel cancer-associated genes, KISS1R, AMH, MNX1, WNK2,
  and PRKRIR Finally, we identified recurrent chromosome alterations in at least 30%
  of tumors in genes, including MACROD2, FHIT, and PARK2 that were often intragenic
  deletions. These structural alterations were validated using the The Cancer Genome
  Atlas dataset. Our studies provide new insights into understanding the genomic landscape,
  genome instability, and mutation profile underlying gastric cancer and ESCC development.
