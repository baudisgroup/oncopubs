abstract: Molecular profiling of human cancer is complicated by both stromal contamination
  and cellular heterogeneity within samples from tumor biopsies. In this study, we
  developed a tissue-processing protocol using mechanical dissociation and flow cytometric
  sorting that resulted in the respective enrichment of stromal and tumor fractions
  from frozen pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples. Molecular profiling of DNA from the
  sorted populations using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays revealed
  widespread chromosomal loss of heterozygosity in tumor fractions but not in either
  the stromal fraction or unsorted tissue specimens from the same sample. Similarly,
  a combination of KRAS mutations and chromosomal copy number changes at key pancreatic
  cancer loci, such as CDK2NA and TP53, was detected in a substantial proportion of
  the tumor fractions but not in matched stromal fractions from the same sample. This
  approach to tissue processing could greatly expand the amount of archived tissue
  that is available for molecular profiling of human cancer and enable a more accurate
  diagnosis of genetic alterations in patient samples.
