abstract: Neuroblastoma NB is a pediatric tumor characterized by high genetic heterogeneity.
  Although the prognostic significance of some genomic abnormalities i.e., MYCN amplification,
  1p loss, and 17q gain is recognized, genes that are involved in chromosome rearrangements
  remain largely unknown. Considerable progress has been made over the last years
  in characterizing DNA abnormalities by metaphase comparative genomic hybridization
  mCGH and array CGH aCGH . Here we report a pilot study of 5 localized and 12 disseminated
  NB by 44,000 and of 4 out of 17 cases by 244,000 oligonucleotide aCGH. Localized
  tumors were predominantly characterized by losses of whole chromosomes 3, 4, 10,
  and 16, and gains of 6, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, and 20, whereas disseminated tumors showed
  several structural aberrations including 17q gain and 3p and 11q losses. Characterization
  of chromosome 2p in MYCN-amplified NB revealed several structural rearrangements
  with regions of gain interspersed among sites of amplification, indicating that
  the MYCN amplicon may encompass several genes. The high-resolution zooming in chromosomal
  aberrant regions detected several micro-deletions and micro-amplifications in the
  NB genome. Our results indicate that the increased sensitivity of the aCGH also
  allows the identification of DNA aberrations in challenging samples i.e., NB showing
  tissue and genetic heterogeneity .
