abstract: Insulinomas represent the predominant syndromic subtype of endocrine pancreatic
  tumours. Previous molecular studies have shown that gain of chromosome 9q rather
  than MEN1 gene mutation is an important early event in tumour development and that
  chromosomal instability is associated with metastatic disease. In order to identify
  new gene loci and to define further the critical genetic events in insulinoma tumourigenesis,
  27 insulinomas were investigated by array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array CGH on 3.7 k genomic BAC arrays resolution amp lt or 1 Mb . Fluorescence in
  situ hybridization was used to validate alterations in a subset of tumours. Array
  CGH most frequently detected loss of chromosomes 11q and 22q and gains of chromosome
  9q. The chromosomal regions of interest CRI included 11q24.1 56 , 22q13.1 67 , 22q13.31
  56 , and 9q32 63 . Evaluation of the simultaneous occurrence of these aberrations
  in the individual tumours revealed that gain of 9q32 and loss of 22q13.1 are early
  genetic events in insulinomas, occurring independently of the other alterations.
  In tumours with increased genomic complexity, these alterations were often detected
  simultaneously, occurring in the same tumour cells. Losses of 11q24.1 and 22q13.31
  were also associated with these more advanced tumour cases. The CRIs identified
  most likely harbour crucial candidate genes important in insulinoma tumourigenesis.
