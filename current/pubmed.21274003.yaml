abstract: About 40 of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs present with a
  normal karyotype, and they are facing different courses of disease. To advance the
  biological understanding and to find molecular prognostic markers, we performed
  a high-resolution oligonucleotide array study of 107 MDS patients French American
  British with a normal karyotype and clinical follow-up through the Duesseldorf MDS
  registry. Recurrent hidden deletions overlapping with known cytogenetic aberrations
  or sites of known tumor-associated genes were identified in 4q24 TET2, 2x , 5q31.2
  2x , 7q22.1 3x and 21q22.12 RUNX1, 2x . One patient with a 7q22.1 deletion had an
  additional 5q31.2 deletion of the acute myeloid leukemia MDS region, the smallest
  deletion identified so far and including the putative tumor suppressor ts genes,
  EGR1 and CTNNA1. One TET2 deletion was homozygous and one heterozygous, with a missense
  mutation in the remaining allele, further supporting its role as a ts gene. Besides
  these recurrent alterations, additional individual imbalances were found in 34 cases
  in total, 42 107 39 cases had genomic imbalances. These patients had an inferior
  survival as compared with the rest of the patients P 0.002 . This study emphasizes
  the heterogeneity of MDS, but points to interesting genes that may have diagnostic
  and prognostic impact.
