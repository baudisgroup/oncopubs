abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a common malignancy, the incidence
  of which is particularly high in some Asian countries due to the geographically
  linked areca quid AQ chewing habit. In this study, array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization was used to screen microdissected OSCCs for genome-wide alterations.
  The highest frequencies of gene gain were detected for TP63, Serpine1, FGF4 FGF3,
  c-Myc and DMD. The highest frequencies of deletion were detected for Caspase8 and
  MTAP. Gained genes, classified by hierarchical clustering, were mainly on 17q21-tel
  20q 11q13 3q27-29 and the X chromosome. Among these, gains of EGFR at 7p, FGF4 FGF3,
  CCND1 and EMS1 at 11q13, and AIB1 at 20q were significantly associated with lymph
  node metastasis. The genomic profiles of FHIT and EXT1 in AQ-associated and non-AQ-associated
  OSCCs exhibited the most prominent differences. RT-PCR confirmed the significant
  increase of TP63 and Serpine1 mRNA expression in OSCC relative to non-malignant
  matched tissue. A significant increase in Serpine1 immunoreactivity was observed
  from non-malignant matched tissue to OSCC. However, there was no correlation between
  the frequent genomic loss of Caspase 8 and a significant decrease in Caspase8 expression.
  These data demonstrate that genomic profiling can be useful in analysing pathogenetic
  events involved in the genesis or progression of OSCC.
