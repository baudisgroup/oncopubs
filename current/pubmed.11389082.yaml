abstract: We applied a combination of molecular cytogenetic methods, including comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , spectral karyotyping SKY , and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization, to characterize the genetic aberrations in a panel of 11 cell lines
  derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 1 cell line derived from
  premalignant oral epithelium. CGH identified recurrent chromosomal losses at 1p,
  3p, 4, 8p, 10p, and 18q gains at 3q, 5p, 8q, 9q, and 14q and high-level amplification
  at 3q13, 3q25-q26, 5q22-q23, 7q21, 8q24, 11q13-q14, 12p13, 14q24, and 20q13.1. Several
  recurrent translocations including t 1 13 q10 q10 , t 13 13 q10 q10 , t 14 14 q10
  q10 , i 8 q10 , and i 9 q10 and breakpoint clusters at 1p11, 1q21, 3p11, 5q11, 5q13,
  6q23, 8p11, 8q11, 9p13, 9q13, 10q11, 11q13, 13q10, 14q10, and 15q10 were identified
  by SKY. There was a good correlation between the number of aberrations identified
  by CGH and SKY r 0.69 , and the analyses were both confirmatory and complementary
  in their assessment of genetic aberrations. Amplification at 3q26-q27 was identified
  in 42 of cases. Although SKY defined the derivation of 3q gain, the precise breakpoint
  remained unassigned. Positional cloning efforts directed at the amplified region
  at 3q26-q27 identified three highly overlapping nonchimeric yeast artificial chromosome
  clones containing the apex of amplification. The use of these yeast artificial chromosome
  clones as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis allowed a detailed
  characterization and quantification of the 3q amplification and refinement of unassigned
  SKY breakpoints.
