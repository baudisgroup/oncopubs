abstract: The pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T-cell
  lymphoma (CTCL), is unknown. Although genetic alterations have been identified,
  none are considered consistently causative in MF. To identify potential drivers
  of MF, we performed whole-genome sequencing of MF tumors and matched normal skin.
  Targeted ultra-deep sequencing of MF samples and exome sequencing of CTCL cell lines
  were also performed. Multiple mutations were identified that affected the same pathways,
  including epigenetic, cell-fate regulation, and cytokine signaling, in MF tumors
  and CTCL cell lines. Specifically, interleukin-2 signaling pathway mutations, including
  activating Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) mutations, were detected. Treatment with a JAK3
  inhibitor significantly reduced CTCL cell survival. Additionally, the mutation data
  identified 2 other potential contributing factors to MF, ultraviolet light, and
  a polymorphism in the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53). Therefore, genetic alterations
  in specific pathways in MF were identified that may be viable, effective new targets
  for treatment.
