abstract: Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic tumor in children, and
  only a limited number of detailed karyotypic analyses have been reported to date.
  In the present study, cytogenetic abnormalities were identified in nine cases of
  hepatoblastoma from a single institution. Among characteristic chromosomal changes
  detected were simple numerical aberrations, structural alterations of chromosomes
  1, 2, and 8, and the recurrent unbalanced rearrangements der 4 t 1 4 q25.2 q35.1
  and der 6 t 1 6 q21 q26 . Array comparative genomic hybridization was applied in
  four of the cases. The combined cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, and histopathologic
  analyses are presented here, together with clinical data. The results substantially
  confirm previous findings of aberrations involving chromosomal loci on 1q, 2 or
  2q, 4q, 6q, 8 or 8q, and 20 as significant in the development and clinical course
  of this disease.
