abstract: Renal cell carcinoma RCC is characterized by a number of diverse molecular
  aberrations that differ among individuals. Recent approaches to molecularly classify
  RCC were based on clinical, pathological as well as on single molecular parameters.
  As a consequence, gene expression patterns reflecting the sum of genetic aberrations
  in individual tumors may not have been recognized. In an attempt to uncover such
  molecular features in RCC, we used a novel, unbiased and integrative approach.
