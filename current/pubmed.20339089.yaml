abstract: In classical Hodgkin lymphoma cHL the mechanisms underlying primary refractory
  disease and relapse remain unknown. To gain further insight into cHL pathogenesis
  and genomic changes linked to treatment response, we studied 53 cHL patients by
  array comparative genomic hybridization, including 23 patients whose primary treatment
  failed, using DNA from microdissected HRS cells. Copy number alterations found in
  more than 20 of cases included gains of 2p, 9p, 16p, 17q, 19q, 20q, and losses of
  6q, 11q, and 13q. We identified at high resolution recurrent changes defining minimally
  gained and lost regions harboring genes involved in nuclear factor kappaB signaling,
  such as REL, IKBKB, CD40, and MAP3K14. Gains of chromosome 16p11.2-13.3 were significantly
  more frequent in pretreatment and relapse biopsies of unresponsive patients and
  were associated with shortened disease-specific survival P .028 . In the therapy-resistant
  HL cell line KMH2, we found genomic gains and overexpression of the multidrug resistance
  gene ABCC1 mapping to cytoband 16p13.11. We show that doxorubicin exposure to KMH2
  induces ABCC1 expression and that siRNA silencing of ABCC1 sensitizes KMH2 cells
  to doxorubicin toxicity in vitro, suggesting that overexpression of ABCC1 contributes
  to the drug resistance phenotype found in KMH2.
