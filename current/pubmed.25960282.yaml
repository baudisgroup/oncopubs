abstract: "Neuroblastoma is a challenging childhood malignancy, with a very high percentage
  of patients relapsing following acquisition of drug resistance, thereby necessitating
  the identification of mechanisms of drug resistance as well as new biological targets
  contributing to the aggressive pathogenicity of the disease. In order to investigate
  the molecular pathways that are involved with drug resistance in neuroblastoma,
  we have developed and characterised cisplatin resistant sublines SK-N-ASCis24, KellyCis83
  and CHP-212Cis100, integrating data of cell behaviour, cytotoxicity, genomic alterations
  and modulation of protein expression. All three cisplatin resistant cell lines demonstrated
  cross resistance to temozolomide, etoposide and irinotecan, all of which are drugs
  in re-initiation therapy. Array CGH analysis indicated that resistant lines have
  acquired additional genomic imbalances. Differentially expressed proteins were identified
  by mass spectrometry and classified by bioinformatics tools according to their molecular
  and cellular functions and their involvement into biological pathways. Significant
  changes in the expression of proteins involved with pathways such as actin cytoskeletal
  signalling (pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x899.28E-10), integrin linked kinase (ILK) signalling
  (pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x894.01E-8), epithelial adherens junctions signalling (pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x895.49E-8)
  and remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions (pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x895.87E-8) pointed
  towards a mesenchymal phenotype developed by cisplatin resistant SK-N-ASCis24. Western
  blotting and confocal microscopy of MYH9, ACTN4 and ROCK1 coupled with invasion
  assays provide evidence that elevated levels of MYH9 and ACTN4 and reduced levels
  of ROCK1 contribute to the increased ROCK1-independent migratory potential of SK-N-ASCis24.
  Therefore, our results suggest that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is a feature
  during the development of drug resistance in neuroblastoma.  Copyright Â© 2015.
