abstract: 'Early T1 stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction
  is a potentially curable disease. We analyzed the genomic spectra of 33 early neoplastic
  lesions after subdividing the tumors into six depths of invasion T1-mucosal, m1-m3
  T1-submucosal, sm1-sm3 . Two subgroups were defined, T1m1-sm1 n 18 and T1sm2-sm3
  n 15 . The latter group is associated with frequent lymphatic spread and a high
  percentage of local and or distant recurrence. Comparative genomic hybridization
  with a genomewide 3,500-element BAC-PAC array revealed a characteristic gastroesophageal
  adenocarcinoma pattern of changes, with losses on chromosome arms 4pq, 5q, 8p, 9p,
  17p, and 18q and gains on 1q, 6p, 7pq, 11q, 15q, 17q, and 20pq. However, when the
  two groups were compared, the following BAC clones showed significantly more alterations
  in the T1sm2-sm3 group: RP11-534L20 1q32.1 and RP11-175A4 6p21.32 , showing gains,
  and RP11-356F24, RP11-433L7, and RP11-241P12 all at 8p , showing losses. Gain of
  RP11-534L20 1q32.1 and loss of RP11-433L7 8p22 were associated not only with a recurrence-free
  period P 0.0007 and 0.007, respectively , but also with regional lymphatic dissemination
  P 0.005 and 0.003, respectively . These DNA clones can be considered genomic markers
  for the aggressive behavior of early esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.'
