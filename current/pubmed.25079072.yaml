abstract: DNA hypomethylation is an important epigenetic modification found to occur
  in many different cancer types, leading to the upregulation of previously silenced
  genes and loss of genomic stability. We previously demonstrated that hypoxia and
  hypoglycaemia (ischemia), two common micro-environmental changes in solid tumours,
  decrease DNA methylation through the downregulation of DNMTs in human colorectal
  cancer cells. Here, we utilized a genome-wide cross-platform approach to identify
  genes hypomethylated and upregulated by ischemia. Following exposure to hypoxia
  or hypoglycaemia, methylated DNA from human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116) was
  immunoprecipitated and analysed with an Affymetrix promoter array. Additionally,
  RNA was isolated and analysed in parallel with an Affymetrix expression array. Ingenuity
  pathway analysis software revealed that a significant proportion of the genes hypomethylated
  and upregulated were involved in cellular movement, including PLAUR and CYR61. A
  Matrigel invasion assay revealed that indeed HCT116 cells grown in hypoxic or hypoglycaemic
  conditions have increased mobility capabilities. Confirmation of upregulated expression
  of cellular movement genes was performed with qPCR. The correlation between ischemia
  and metastasis is well established in cancer progression, but the molecular mechanisms
  responsible for this common observation have not been clearly identified. Our novel
  data suggests that hypoxia and hypoglycaemia may be driving changes in DNA methylation
  through downregulation of DNMTs. This is the first report to our knowledge that
  provides an explanation for the increased metastatic potential seen in ischemic
  cells; i.e. that ischemia could be driving DNA hypomethylation and increasing expression
  of cellular movement genes.
