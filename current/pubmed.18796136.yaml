abstract: We present a strategy for detection of loss-of-heterozygosity and allelic
  imbalance in cancer cells from whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping
  data. Using a dilution series of a tumor cell line mixed with its paired normal
  cell line and data generated on Affymetrix and Illumina platforms, including paired
  tumor-normal samples and tumors characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization,
  we demonstrate a high sensitivity and specificity of the strategy for detecting
  both minute and gross allelic imbalances in heterogeneous tumor samples.
