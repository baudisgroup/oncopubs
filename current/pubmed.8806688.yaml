abstract: Genomic alterations associated with glioma progression were determined by
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH 30 tumors from 15 patients with primary gliomas
  of World Health Organization WHO grade II that on recurrence showed progression
  to malignant gliomas of WHO grades III or IV five cases of astrocytoma grade II
  A II to grade III AA III , five cases of A II to glioblastoma multiforme grade IV
  GBM and five cases of oligodendroglioma grade II O II to grade III AO III . All
  tumors were additionally screened for p53 mutations by single strand conformational
  polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis of exons 5-8, followed by direct sequencing.
  Mutations of p53 were found in the primary and recurrent tumors of all cases of
  A II progressing to GBM and three of five cases of A II recurring as AA III. Alterations
  identified by CGH in more than one primary A II included losses on Xp 3 10 and 5p
  2 10 , gains on 8q and 19p 2 10 each , and gain amplification on 12p 2 10 . Common
  progression associated changes found in AA III or GBM were losses on 4q, 9p, 10q,
  11p, 13q 4 10 each and gains on 1q, 6p, 20q 2 10 each . The most frequent amplification
  site was located on 12p13 1 10 A II, 3 5 AA III, 1 5 GBM . Other amplified chromosomal
  regions were 13q32-q34 1 10 AII, 2 5 GBM , 7q31-qter 1 5 AA III, 1 5 GBM , 12q22-qter
  and 18p 1 5 AA III . In contrast to the astrocytic gliomas, only one of five oligodendroglial
  cases showed a p53 mutation. Genetic abnormalities identified by CGH to occur more
  than once were restricted to four chromosomes 1, 4, 9 and 19 . Our results provide
  a comprehensive overview of the genomic alterations associated with the progression
  of individual gliomas and substantiate the hypothesis that glioma progression is
  associated with a cumulative acquisition of multiple genetic changes.
