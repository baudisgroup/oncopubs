abstract: Gastric carcinoma GC is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and
  has a very poor prognosis. Genetic imbalances in 62 primary gastric adenocarcinomas
  of various histopathologic types and pathologic stages and six gastric cancer-derived
  cell lines were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization, and the relationship
  of genomic abnormalities to clinical features in primary GC was evaluated at a genome-wide
  level. Eighty-four percent of the tumors and all six cell lines showed DNA copy
  number changes. The recurrent chromosomal abnormalities including gains at 15 regions
  and losses at 8 regions were identified. Statistical analyses revealed that gains
  at 17q24-qter 53 , 20q13-qter 48 , 1p32-p36 42 , 22q12-qter 27 , 17p13-pter 24 ,
  16p13-pter 21 , 6p21-pter 19 , 20p12-pter 19 , 7p21-pter 18 , 3q28-qter 8 , and
  13q13-q14 8 , and losses at 18q12-qter 11 , 3p12 8 , 3p25-pter 8 , 5q14-q23 8 ,
  and 9p21-p23 5 , are associated with unique patient or tumor-related features. GCs
  of differing histopathologic features were shown to be associated with distinct
  patterns of genetic alterations, supporting the notion that they evolve through
  distinct genetic pathways. Metastatic tumors were also associated with specific
  genetic changes. These regions may harbor candidate genes involved in the pathogenesis
  of this malignancy.
