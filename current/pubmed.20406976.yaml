abstract: In the present investigation, we sought to refine the classification of
  urothelial carcinoma by combining information on gene expression, genomic, and gene
  mutation levels. For these purposes, we performed gene expression analysis of 144
  carcinomas, and whole genome array-CGH analysis and mutation analyses of FGFR3,
  PIK3CA, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and TSC1 in 103 of these cases. Hierarchical
  cluster analysis identified two intrinsic molecular subtypes, MS1 and MS2, which
  were validated and defined by the same set of genes in three independent bladder
  cancer data sets. The two subtypes differed with respect to gene expression and
  mutation profiles, as well as with the level of genomic instability. The data show
  that genomic instability was the most distinguishing genomic feature of MS2 tumors,
  and that this trait was not dependent on TP53 MDM2 alterations. By combining molecular
  and pathologic data, it was possible to distinguish two molecular subtypes of T
  a and T 1 tumors, respectively. In addition, we define gene signatures validated
  in two independent data sets that classify urothelial carcinoma into low-grade G
  1 G 2 and high-grade G 3 tumors as well as non-muscle and muscle-invasive tumors
  with high precisions and sensitivities, suggesting molecular grading as a relevant
  complement to standard pathologic grading. We also present a gene expression signature
  with independent prognostic effect on metastasis and disease-specific survival.
  We conclude that the combination of molecular and histopathologic classification
  systems might provide a strong improvement for bladder cancer classification and
  produce new insights into the development of this tumor type.
