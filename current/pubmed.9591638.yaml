abstract: We performed a comparative genomic hybridization study on 25 samples of
  adenocarcinoma and 19 samples of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung to detect recurrent
  changes in the genetic material. DNA copy number changes were found in 16 squamous
  cell carcinoma samples and 17 adenocarcinoma samples. The most common changes were
  gains of DNA sequences in 3q 43 , 1q 34 , 8q 32 , 5p, 30 , 7p 25 , and 12p 25 .
  Of the squamous cell carcinoma samples with DNA copy number changes, 94 15 16 had
  a gain in 3q minimal common region of overlap q24-qter , whereas only 24 4 17 of
  the adenocarcinoma samples with DNA copy number changes showed a gain in 3q q22-qter
  P amp lt 0.001 . Six high-level amplifications in 3q q26.2-q26.3 were detected in
  the squamous cell carcinoma samples but none were observed in the adenocarcinoma
  samples. Our results suggest that amplification of genes in 3q may be important
  in the tumorigenesis of squamous cell carcinoma but not necessarily of adenocarcinoma.
