abstract: Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors and comprise a group
  of morphologically, biologically and clinically heterogeneous neoplasms. The different
  glioma types are associated with distinct genetic aberrations, which may provide
  useful information for tumor classification as well as prediction of prognosis and
  response to therapy. To facilitate the molecular classification of gliomas, we established
  a genomic microarray that consists of bacterial artificial chromosome BAC and P1-derived
  artificial chromosome PAC clones representing tumor suppressor genes, proto-oncogenes
  and chromosomal regions frequently gained or lost in gliomas. In addition, reference
  clones distributed evenly throughout the genome in approximately 15 Mbp intervals
  were spotted on the microarray. These customized microarrays were used for matrix-based
  comparative genomic hybridization matrix CGH analysis of 70 gliomas. Matrix CGH
  findings were validated by molecular genetic analyses of candidate genes, loss of
  heterozygosity studies and chromosomal CGH. Our results indicate that matrix CGH
  allows for the sensitive and specific detection of gene amplifications as well as
  low-level copy number gains and losses in clinical glioma samples. Furthermore,
  molecular classification based on matrix CGH data closely paralleled histological
  classification and was able to distinguish with few exceptions between diffuse astrocytomas
  and oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas,
  anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas, as well as primary and secondary
  glioblastomas. Thus, matrix CGH is a powerful technique that allows for an automated
  genomic profiling of gliomas and represents a promising new tool for their molecular
  classification.
