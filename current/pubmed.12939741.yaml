abstract: Neoplasms of the vulva and vagina account for less than 5 of all female
  genital tract cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma SCC represents more than 70 of the
  cases in both locales, followed by melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, Pagets disease,
  and other carcinoma subtypes. Until recently, only few cases had been analyzed by
  chromosome banding techniques and karyotyped, and also the number subjected to molecular
  cytogenetic analysis remains low. To understand better the genetic changes harbored
  by the neoplastic cells in cancer of the vulva and vagina, we analyzed cytogenetically
  51 such tumors, finding karyotypic abnormalities in 37. All tumors were analyzed
  by G-banding, sometimes supplemented by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization,
  and a subset of tumors was also analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. The
  two cytogenetically abnormal cases of Pagets disease both had two clones, one with
  gain of chromosome 7 as the sole change, the other with loss of the X chromosome
  among, in one case, other aberrations. The four cytogenetically abnormal malignant
  melanomas three of the vulva, one of the vagina presented complex karyotypes with
  aberrations involving different chromosomes but most often chromosome 1, specifically
  1p12-q41. In the 31 cytogenetically abnormal SCCs, different clonal karyotypic abnormalities
  were seen. Intratumor heterogeneity with multiple clones was observed in 11 cases.
  The clones were cytogenetically unrelated in eight tumors but related in three,
  indicating that in the latter clonal evolution had taken place from a single malignantly
  transformed cell. The main chromosomal imbalances were gains of, or from, chromosome
  arms 3q, 5p, 8q, 9q, and 19q, and loss from 11q. Breakpoint clusters were seen in
  11q13-23, 2q22-35, and 19q13, as well as in the centromeres and pericentromeric
  bands of chromosomes 3, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 22.
