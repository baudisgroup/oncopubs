abstract: We have applied the method of genomic microarray to investigate amplification
  of oncogenes throughout the genome of nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC . Array based
  comparative genomic hybridization array CGH allows simultaneous examination of 58
  oncogenes commonly amplified in various human cancers. In the present study, we
  have examined 15 NPC samples including five cell lines, two xenografts and eight
  primary tumours with array CGH to reveal the particular oncogenes associated with
  this cancer. This is the first genome wide survey of multiple oncogene amplifications
  involved in the development of NPC. Non-random gene amplifications were identified
  for the first time in NPC on MYCL1 in 1p34.3 and on TERC and PIK3CA at 3q26.3. Other
  high level amplified oncogenes included NRAS, RAF1, MYB, EGFR, FGF4, EMS1, and D17S167.
  Highest frequencies of gain of novel oncogenes were detected on MYCL1 66.7 , TERC
  46.7 , ESR 46.7 , PIK3CA 40 , LAMC2 33.3 , and CSE1L 33.3 .
