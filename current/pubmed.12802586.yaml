abstract: Primary central nervous system lymphoma PCNSL is a rare disease. A small
  number of cytogenetic studies of PCNSL have been conducted and several reports have
  been published on associated molecular and protein expression data. We combined
  these approaches in a series of eight PCNSL cases, analyzing the chromosomal abnormalities
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , testing for Epstein Barr virus EBV
  involvement by in situ hybridization for EBER, assessing expression of p53, Bcl-2,
  Bcl-6 and CD10 by means of immunohistochemistry, and screening for mutations of
  the TP53 gene by DGGE. TP53 gene mutations and EBV expression were not detected.
  Most of the cases showed p53, Bcl-6 and Bcl-2 protein expression. CGH revealed DNA
  copy number changes in all eight cases. The most frequent changes were gains of
  chromosome 12 63 , chromosome 18 50 and 20q 38 , and loss of chromosome arm 6q 75
  . No correlation between protein expression and chromosomal abnormalities was found
  in these eight cases. Although gains of chromosome 12, 18 and 20q and loss of 6q
  have also been reported in systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, the frequency
  of 6q deletion is clearly higher in PCNSL. This creates a similarity to primary
  lymphomas of the testes that also frequently have deletions of 6q. This suggests
  that suppressor genes located on chromosome 6q may play a role in the development
  of lymphomas at immunoprivileged sites, like the CNS.
