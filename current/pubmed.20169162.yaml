abstract: To gain insight into the role of genomic alterations in breast cancer progression,
  we conducted a comprehensive genetic characterization of a series of four cell lines
  derived from MCF10A. MCF10A is an immortalized mammary epithelial cell line MEC
  MCF10AT is a premalignant cell line generated from MCF10A by transformation with
  an activated HRAS gene MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a, both derived from MCF10AT xenografts,
  form well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated malignant tumors in the xenograft
  models, respectively. We analyzed DNA copy number variation using the Affymetrix
  500 K SNP arrays with the goal of identifying gene-specific amplification and deletion
  events. In addition to a previously noted deletion in the CDKN2A locus, our studies
  identified MYC amplification in all four cell lines. Additionally, we found intragenic
  deletions in several genes, including LRP1B in MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a, FHIT and
  CDH13 in MCF10CA1h, and RUNX1 in MCF10CA1a. We confirmed the deletion of RUNX1 in
  MCF10CA1a by DNA and RNA analyses, as well as the absence of the RUNX1 protein in
  that cell line. Furthermore, we found that RUNX1 expression was reduced in high-grade
  primary breast tumors compared to low mid-grade tumors. Mutational analysis identified
  an activating PIK3CA mutation, H1047R, in MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a, which correlates
  with an increase of AKT1 phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308. Furthermore, we showed
  increased expression levels for genes located in the genomic regions with copy number
  gain. Thus, our genetic analyses have uncovered sequential molecular events that
  delineate breast tumor progression. These events include CDKN2A deletion and MYC
  amplification in immortalization, HRAS activation in transformation, PIK3CA activation
  in the formation of malignant tumors, and RUNX1 deletion associated with poorly-differentiated
  malignant tumors.
