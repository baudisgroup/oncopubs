abstract: The molecular pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is poorly understood.
  Whole-genome and exome sequencing followed by innovative tumorgraft analyses (to
  accurately determine mutant allele ratios) identified several putative two-hit tumor
  suppressor genes, including BAP1. The BAP1 protein, a nuclear deubiquitinase, is
  inactivated in 15% of clear cell RCCs. BAP1 cofractionates with and binds to HCF-1
  in tumorgrafts. Mutations disrupting the HCF-1 binding motif impair BAP1-mediated
  suppression of cell proliferation but not deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated
  histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). BAP1 loss sensitizes RCC cells in vitro to genotoxic
  stress. Notably, mutations in BAP1 and PBRM1 anticorrelate in tumors (P = 3 ï¿½
  10(-5)), [corrected] and combined loss of BAP1 and PBRM1 in a few RCCs was associated
  with rhabdoid features (q = 0.0007). BAP1 and PBRM1 regulate seemingly different
  gene expression programs, and BAP1 loss was associated with high tumor grade (q
  = 0.0005). Our results establish the foundation for an integrated pathological and
  molecular genetic classification of RCC, paving the way for subtype-specific treatments
  exploiting genetic vulnerabilities.
