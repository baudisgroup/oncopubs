abstract: The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence and clinical
  significance of SIL-TAL1 rearrangements in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).
  The incidence of SIL-TAL1 rearrangements was analyzed by nest real-time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 68 patients with T-ALL. Karyotypic analysis
  was performed by conventional R-banding assay and array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization (array-CGH). The results showed that SIL-TAL1 rearrangements were
  identified in 10/26 (38.5%) pediatric and 2/42 (4.8%) adult T-ALL cases, which indicate
  a pediatric preference for SIL-TAL1 rearrangements in T-ALL. Two different transcripts
  were detected in 6/12(50%) T-ALL samples. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 6
  out of 11 cases (54.5%) and a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 was observed
  in 4 cases. Array-CGH results of 2 T-ALL cases with SIL-TAL1 rearrangement revealed
  that this fusion gene was resulted from a cryptic deletion of 1p32, and the overlap
  region of 6q deletion was 6q14.1-16.3. These cases with SIL-TAL1 fusion had a higher
  white blood cell (WBC) count and higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
  than cases without SIL-TAL1 fusion. It is concluded that SIL-TAL1 rearrangements
  are associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal 6q, and SIL-TAL1-positive
  patients are younger than SIL-TAL1-negative patients. In contrast to the cases without
  SIL-TAL1 fusion, there are many adverse prognostic factors in the cases with SIL-TAL1
  fusion, such as higher WBC count and higher LDH levels.
