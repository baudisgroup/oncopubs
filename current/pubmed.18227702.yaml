abstract: Uveal melanoma UM is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults.
  Loss of the long arm and gain of the short arm of chromosome 6 are frequently observed
  chromosomal aberrations in UM, together with loss of chromosome 1p36, loss of chromosome
  3 and gain of chromosome 8. This suggests the presence of one or more oncogenes
  on 6p and tumor suppressor genes at 6q that are involved in UM development. Both
  regions, however, have not been well defined yet. Furthermore in other neoplasms
  gain of 6p and loss of 6q are frequently occurring events. In this case report,
  we describe the delineation of a partial gain on chromosome 6p and a partial deletion
  on 6q in a UM with the objective to pinpoint smaller candidate regions on chromosome
  6 involved in UM development. Conventional cytogenetics, comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and fluorescence in-situ hybridization FISH were used to delineate regions of
  loss and gain on chromosome 6 in this UM patient. With conventional cytogenetics
  a deleted region was found on chromosome 6q that was further delineated to a region
  ranging from 6q16.1 to 6q22 using CGH and FISH. A region of gain from 6pter to 6p21.2
  was also demarcated with CGH and FISH. No other deletions or amplifications on recurrently
  involved chromosomes were found in this patient. This study indicates the presence
  of one or more tumor suppressor genes on chromosomal region 6q16.1-6q22 and the
  presence of one or more oncogenes on chromosomal region 6pter-6p21.2, which are
  likely to be important in UM and other tumors.
