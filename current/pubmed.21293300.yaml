abstract: Loss of chromosome 1p 19q in oligodendrogliomas represents a powerful predictor
  of good prognosis. Expression of internexin INA , a neuronal specific intermediate
  filament protein, has recently been proposed as a surrogate marker for 1p 19q deletion
  based on the high degree of correlation between both parameters in oligodendrogliomas.
  The aim of this study was to assess further the diagnostic utility of INA expression
  in a set of genetically well-characterized oligodendrogliomas. On the basis of a
  conservative approach for copy number determination, using both comparative genomic
  hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization, INA expression as a surrogate
  marker for 1p 19q loss had both reduced specificity 80 and sensitivity 79 compared
  with respective values of 86 and 96 reported in the previous report. The histologic
  interpretation and diagnostic value of INA expression in oligodendrogliomas should
  therefore be assessed with greater caution when compared with 1p 19q DNA copy number
  analysis. In addition, DNA copy number aberrations of chromosomes 10, 16, and 17
  were detected exclusively in 1p 19q codeleted samples, suggesting that other regions
  of the genome may contribute to the 1p 19q-deleted tumor phenotype inthese samples.
