abstract: Copy number alterations in a matched pair of benign epithelial and prostate
  cancer cell lines derived from the same patient were assessed using array-based
  comparative genomic hybridisation aCGH . The cancer cell line showed a gain of chromosome
  7, deletion of chromosome 8, gains including high level and losses on chromosome
  11, loss of 18p and gain of 20q. Deletions on chromosome 8 were confirmed with microsatellite
  markers. The aCGH results were compared to gene expression data obtained using DNA
  microarrays and suggested the involvement of caspases and ICEBERG on 11q and E2F1
  on chromosome 20q.
