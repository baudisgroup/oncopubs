abstract: Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have multiple lesions
  (primary tumors, intrahepatic metastases, multiple occurrences, satellite nodules,
  and tumor thrombi); these have been associated with a poor prognosis and tumor recurrence
  after surgery. We investigated the clonal relationship among these lesions on the
  basis of genetic features.  We collected 43 lesions and 10 matched control samples
  (blood or non-tumorous liver) from 10 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated
  HCC treated at Tianjin Cancer Hospital (China) from January 2013 through May 2014.
  We performed exome and low-depth whole genome sequencing on these samples. Genomic
  aberrations, including somatic mutations and copy number variations, were identified
  using germline DNA as control. We compared the genetic features of different lesions
  from each patient and constructed phylogenetic trees to depict their evolutionary
  histories.  In each patient, mutations shared by all the lesions were called ubiquitous
  mutations. The percentage of ubiquitous mutations varied from 8% to 97% among patients,
  indicating variation in the extent of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Branched evolution
  was evident, with somatic mutations, HBV integrations, and copy number variations
  identified on both the trunks and branches of the phylogenetic trees. Intra-hepatic
  metastases and tumor thrombi contained some, but not all, of the mutations detected
  in their matched primary lesions. By contrast, satellite nodules shared approximately
  90% of mutations detected in primary lesions. In a patient with multi-centric tumors,
  6 lesions were assigned to 2 distinct groups, based on significant differences in
  genetic features. In another patient with combined hepatocellular and intrahepatic
  cholangiocarcinoma, the physically separate HCC and cholangiocarcinoma lesions shared
  102 mutations.  The extent of intra-tumor heterogeneity varies considerably among
  patients with HCC. Therefore, sequence analysis of a single lesion cannot completely
  characterize the genomic features of HCC in some patients. Genomic comparisons of
  multiple lesions associated with HCCs will provide important information on the
  genetic changes associated with tumor progression.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 AGA Institute.
