abstract: Olfactory neuroblastoma esthesioneuroblastoma is a very rare tumour of the
  olfactory mucosa. Morphological features and cytogenetic studies strongly suggest
  a neuro-ectodermal origin. Up to now, cytogenetic studies are inconsistent. Some
  of them have proposed that the tumour belongs to the pPNET family. In the present
  study we describe genomic imbalances in olfactory neuroblastoma in a 46-year-old
  woman by using the molecular cytogenetic technique--comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH --in order to define the spectrum of genetic abnormalities in the tumour. The
  anatomical location and morphological findings were the basis for the diagnosis
  of esthesionearoblastoma. Immunohistochemical reactions for NSE, synaptophysin,
  chromogranin A, HNK-1 Leu-7 and S-100 revealed a characteristic immunophenotype.
  The CGH analysis showed multiple changes including DNA overrepresentations of chromosomes
  4, 8, 11 and 14, partial DNA gains of the long arms of chromosomes 1 and 17, deletions
  of the entire chromosomes 16, 18, 19 and X, and partial losses of chromosomes 5q
  and 17p. This study represents an early utilisation of the CGH technique in olfactory
  neuroblastoma and demonstrates that the tumour carries complex chromosomal aberrations.
