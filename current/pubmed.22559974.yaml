abstract: The estrogen receptor ER is a well-known predictor of breast cancer response
  to endocrine therapy. ER progesterone receptor PR - breast tumors have a poorer
  response to endocrine therapy and a more aggressive phenotype than ER PR tumors.
  A comparative genomic hybridization array technique was used to examine 25 ER PR
  and 23 ER PR- tumors. Tissue microarrays composed of 50 ER PR and 50 ER PR- tumors
  were developed to validate the comparative genomic hybridization array results.
  The genes of interest were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The ER
  PR- group had a slightly different genomic profile when compared with ER PR tumors.
  Chromosomes 17 and 20 contained the most overlapping gains, and chromosomes 3, 8,
  9, 14, 17, 21, and 22 contained the most overlapping losses when compared with the
  ER PR group. The gained regions, 17q23.2-q23.3 and 20q13.12, and the lost regions,
  3p21.32-p12.3, 9pter-p13.2, 17pter-p12, and 21pter-q21.1, occurred at different
  alteration frequencies and were statistically significant in the ER PR- tumors compared
  with the ER PR tumors. ER PR- breast tumors have a different genomic profile compared
  with ER PR tumors. Differentially lost regions in the ER PR- group included genes
  with tumor suppressor functions and genes involved in apoptosis, mitosis, angiogenesis,
  and cell spreading. Differentially gained regions included genes such as MAP3K3,
  RPS6KB1, and ZNF217. Amplification of these genes could contribute to resistance
  to apoptosis, increased activation of the PI3K Akt mTOR pathway, and the loss of
  PR in at least some ER PR- tumors.
