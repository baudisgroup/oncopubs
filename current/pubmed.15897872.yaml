abstract: Amplification of 8p11-12 is a well-known alteration in human breast cancers
  but the driving oncogene has not been identified. We have developed a high-resolution
  comparative genomic hybridization array covering 8p11-12 and analysed 33 primary
  breast tumors, 20 primary ovarian tumors and 27 breast cancer cell lines. Expression
  analysis of the genes in the region was carried out by using real-time quantitative
  PCR and or oligo-microarray profiling. In all, 24 8 33 of the breast tumors, 5 1
  20 of the ovary tumors and 15 4 27 of the cell lines showed 8p11-12 amplification.
  We identified a 1 Mb segment of common amplification that excludes previously proposed
  candidate genes. Some of the amplified genes did not show overexpression, whereas
  for others, overexpression was not specifically attributable to amplification. The
  genes FLJ14299, C8orf2, BRF2 and RAB11FIP, map within the 8p11-12 minimal amplicon,
  two have a putative function consistent with an oncogenic role, these four genes
  showed a strong correlation between amplification and overexpression and are therefore
  the best candidate driver oncogenes at 8p12.
