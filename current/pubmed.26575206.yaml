abstract: Recent evidence indicates that melanoma comprises distinct types of tumors
  and suggests that specific morphological features may help predict its clinical
  behavior. Using a SNP-array approach, we quantified chromosomal copy number alterations
  (CNA) across the whole-genome in 41 primary melanomas and found a high degree of
  heterogeneity in their genomic asset. Association analysis correlating the number
  and relative length of CNA with clinical, morphological and dermoscopic attributes
  of melanoma revealed that features of aggressiveness were strongly linked to the
  overall amount of genomic damage. Furthermore, we observed that melanoma progression
  and survival were mainly affected by a low number of large chromosome losses and
  a high number of small gains. We identified the alterations most frequently associated
  with aggressive melanoma and, by integrating our data with publicly available gene
  expression profiles, we identified five genes which expression was found to be necessary
  for melanoma cells proliferation. In conclusion, this work provides new evidence
  that the phenotypic heterogeneity of melanoma reflects a parallel genetic diversity,
  and lays the basis to define novel strategies for a more precise prognostic stratification
  of patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  This
