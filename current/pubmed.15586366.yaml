abstract: In this study, 23 ovarian cancer cell lines were screened using array-comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH based on large-insert clones at about 1 Mb density from
  throughout the genome. The most frequent recurrent changes at the level of the chromosome
  arm were loss of chromosome 4 or 4q, loss of 18q and gain of 20 or 20q other recurrent
  changes included losses of 6q, 8p, 9p, 11p, 15q, 16q, 17p, and 22q, and gain of
  7q. Losses of 4q and 18q occurred together more often than expected. Evidence was
  found for two types of ovarian cancer, one typically near-triploid and characterized
  by a generally higher frequency of chromosomal changes especially losses of 4p,
  4q, 13q, 15q, 16p, 16q, 18p and 18q , and the other typically near-diploid tetraploid
  and with fewer changes overall, but with relatively high frequencies of 9p loss,
  9q gain, and 20p gain. Multiple novel changes amplifications, homozygous deletions,
  discrete regions of gain or loss, small overlapping regions of change and frequently
  changed clones were also detected, each of which might indicate the locations of
  oncogenes or tumour suppressor loci. For example, at least two regions of amplification
  on chromosome 11q13, one including cyclin D1 and the other the candidate oncogene
  PAK1, were found. Amplification on 11q22 near the progesterone receptor gene and
  a cluster of matrix metalloproteinase loci was also detected. Other potential oncogenes,
  which mapped to regions found by this study, included cyclin E and PIK3C2G. Candidate
  tumour suppressor genes in regions of loss included CDKN2C, SMAD4-interacting protein
  and RASSF2.
