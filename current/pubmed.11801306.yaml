abstract: The ganglioneuroblastoma are rare lesions with widespread neuronal differentiation
  that have been classified as intermediate stages between neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma.
  To identify overall chromosome aberrations in ganglioneuroblastoma, we performed
  comparative genomic hybridization. All of the five tumor samples were found to exhibit
  multiple gains involving different chromosomal regions. Chromosomal gains displayed
  by chromosomes and chromosome loci were 2p25 approximately pter 60 , 5p15.1 approximately
  p15.3 60 , 7 60 , 13q22 approximately q31 60 , and 22 60 , which were detected as
  minimal common regions in all five tumor samples. Chromosome 22 gain, which had
  not been reported in neuronal tumors before, and novel site 13q22 approximately
  q31 may be considered to play an important role in progression and differentiation
  of ganglioneuroblastoma.
