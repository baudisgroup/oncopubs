abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH allows for the simultaneous
  examination of thousands of genomic loci at 1-2 Mb resolution. Copy number alterations
  detected by array-based CGH can aid in the identification and localization of cancer
  causing genes. Here we report the results of array-based CGH in a set of 125 primary
  colorectal tumors hybridized onto an array consisting of 2463 bacterial artificial
  chromosome clones. On average, 17.3 of the entire genome was altered in our samples
  8.5 - 6.7 gained and 8.8 - 7.3 lost . Losses involving 8p, 17p, 18p or 18q occurred
  in 37, 46, 49 and 60 of cases, respectively. Gains involving 8q or 20q were observed
  42 and 65 of the time, respectively. A transition from loss to gain occurred on
  chromosome 8 between 41 and 48 Mb, with 25 of cases demonstrating a gain of 8p11
  45-53 Mb . Chromosome 8 also contained four distinct loci demonstrating high-level
  amplifications, centering at 44.9, 60, 92.7 and 144.7 Mb. On 20q multiple high-level
  amplifications were observed, centering at 32.3, 37.8, 45.4, 54.7, 59.4 and 65 Mb.
  Few differences in DNA copy number alterations were associated with tumor stage,
  location, age and sex of the patient. Microsatellite stable and unstable MSI-H tumors
  differed significantly with respect to the frequency of alterations 20 versus 5
  , respectively, P amp lt 0.01 . Interestingly, MSI-H tumors were also observed to
  have DNA copy number alterations, most commonly involving 8q. This high-resolution
  analysis of DNA copy number alterations in colorectal cancer by array-based CGH
  allowed for the identification of many small, previously uncharacterized, genomic
  regions, such as on chromosomes 8 and 20. Array-based CGH was also able to identify
  DNA copy number changes in MSI-H tumors.

notes: Data for the 40 cases (out of the original 125) presented here was found as
  part of the BioC aCGH package (author Jane Fridlyand). Log2 ratios were extracted,
  and case specific pseudo ISCN annotations were generated using the aCGH2ProgenetiXML
  software.
