abstract: Numerous studies have tested the association between TP53 mutations in ovarian
  cancer and prognosis but these have been consistently confounded by limitations
  in study design, methodology, and or heterogeneity in the sample cohort. High-grade
  serous HGS carcinoma is the most clinically important histological subtype of ovarian
  cancer. As these tumours may arise from the ovary, Fallopian tube or peritoneum,
  they are collectively referred to as high-grade pelvic serous carcinoma HGPSC .
  To identify the true prevalence of TP53 mutations in HGPSC, we sequenced exons 2-11
  and intron-exon boundaries in tumour DNA from 145 patients. HGPSC cases were defined
  as having histological grade 2 or 3 and FIGO stage III or IV. Surprisingly, pathogenic
  TP53 mutations were identified in 96.7 n 119 123 of HGPSC cases. Molecular and pathological
  review of mutation-negative cases showed evidence of p53 dysfunction associated
  with copy number gain of MDM2 or MDM4, or indicated the exclusion of samples as
  being low-grade serous tumours or carcinoma of uncertain primary site. Overall,
  p53 dysfunction rate approached 100 of confirmed HGPSCs. No association between
  TP53 mutation and progression-free or overall survival was found. From this first
  comprehensive mapping of TP53 mutation rate in a homogeneous group of HGPSC patients,
  we conclude that mutant TP53 is a driver mutation in the pathogenesis of HGPSC cancers.
  Because TP53 mutation is almost invariably present in HGPSC, it is not of substantial
  prognostic or predictive significance.
