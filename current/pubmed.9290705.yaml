abstract: Uterine leiomyomas are the most prevalent tumor type in women of reproductive
  age and are the most common reason for hysterectomies. Although uterine leiomyomas
  are considered to be benign, they are a major public health concern for women. In
  contrast, leiomyosarcomas are rare but highly malignant uterine tumors. They may
  arise in uteri with preexisting leiomyomas and histologically sometimes resemble
  leiomyomas, thus causing controversy about whether leiomyosarcomas arise within
  leiomyomas. In this study, we used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to identify
  genetic alterations unique to each tumor type and alterations that are common between
  the two tumors. We analyzed 14 cases of uterine leiomyomas and eight cases of uterine
  leiomyosarcomas. Only two of the 14 leiomyomas exhibited genetic alterations, and
  those were restricted to gains on chromosomes 14 and 19 and losses on chromosomes
  1 and 4. In addition, 68 leiomyomas were examined for loss of heterozygosity on
  chromosomes 1 and 4, and only three tumors exhibited any losses. In contrast, all
  eight leiomyosarcomas showed gains and losses of DNA by CGH, and in many cases multiple
  changes were observed. The most commonly observed genetic aberration, occurring
  in five tumors, was gains on both arms of chromosome 1, suggesting that this chromosome
  contains loci involved in the development of leiomyosarcoma. Our results do not
  provide evidence for the progression from benign leiomyoma to malignant leiomyosarcoma.
  Moreover, the large number of random chromosomal alterations in the leiomyosarcomas
  suggests that increased genetic instability plays a role in the formation of these
  tumors.
