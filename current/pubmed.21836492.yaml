abstract: We report on the highly unusual case of a 75-year-old woman who developed
  a biphasic right axillary mass of apparent melanoma and adenocarcinoma 13 years
  after a diagnosis of primary melanoma on her right upper back. The differential
  diagnosis included a collision tumor and metastatic melanoma with adenocarcinomatous
  transdifferentiation. We utilized immunohistochemical staining, DNA sequencing,
  and comparative genomic hybridization CGH to characterize this unusual tumor. By
  immunohistochemistry, the melanomatous component was positive for S100 and Melan-A,
  and had patchy positivity for cytokeratin. The adenocarcinomatous component was
  negative for melanoma markers, but was strongly positive for cytokeratin. In addition,
  the glandular component was positive for CDX-2 and Ber-EP4, giving the distinct
  histologic and immunohistochemical impression of a gastrointestinal metastasis nested
  within a deposit of metastatic melanoma. Clinical and radiologic workup failed to
  reveal a primary gastrointestinal malignancy. Molecular genetic analysis, including
  DNA sequencing and CGH, revealed that both areas contained an identical NRAS Q61K
  mutation and had highly similar CGH profiles, including gains of chromosome 1q and
  losses of 1p, 4, 9, and 10, which are archetypical of melanoma. The NRAS mutation
  was also identified in a deposit of metastatic melanoma resected 12 years earlier,
  but was not seen in the patients nontumorous tissue, indicating that it was somatically
  acquired. Genetic analyses demonstrate that 2 morphologically distinct tumors arose
  from a common ancestor melanoma cell that harbored an NRAS mutation and subsequently
  divergently evolved by the acquisition of additional genomic alterations. Our findings
  illustrate the ability of molecular analyses to resolve lineage in complex neoplasms
  and illustrate the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells.
