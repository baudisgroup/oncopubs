abstract: Primary effusion lymphoma PEL is a diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma with poor
  prognosis. One hundred percent of PELs carry the genome of Kaposi sarcoma-associated
  herpesvirus and a majority are coinfected with Epstein-Barr virus EBV . We profiled
  genomic aberrations in PEL cells using the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. This identified
  for the first time individual genes that are altered in PEL cells. Eleven of 13
  samples 85 were deleted for the fragile site tumor suppressors WWOX and FHIT. Alterations
  were also observed in the DERL1, ETV1, RASA4, TPK1, TRIM56, and VPS41 genes, which
  are yet to be characterized for their roles in cancer. Coinfection with EBV was
  associated with significantly fewer gross genomic aberrations, and PEL could be
  segregated into EBV-positive and EBV-negative clusters on the basis of host chromosome
  alterations. This suggests a model in which both host genetic aberrations and the
  2 viruses contribute to the PEL phenotype.
