abstract: There is a clear genetic component to prostate cancer susceptibility. Regions
  reported to be linked to prostate cancer include 1q24-25 HPC-1 , 1q42.2-43, and
  Xq27-28. There is limited genetic information on familial prostate tumors. We used
  the Utah Population Database to identify familial prostate cancer cases and selected
  35 cases from high-risk families. Tissue blocks containing discernable tumor were
  available from 19 cases 13 of these yielded adequate specimens for analysis. Six
  cases came from families with linkage to HPC-1, 3 were known to have linkage to
  Xq27-28, and 4 had no linkage to a known locus 7 cases were analyzed from patients
  who showed no known linkage sporadic tumors as controls. These paraffin-embedded
  tumors were laser microdissected, degenerate oligonucleotide DOP -amplified, and
  labeled for fluorescence detection by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Loss
  of 7q, 10q, and 16q and gain of 8q were common abnormalities present in both familial
  and sporadic tumors. Distinctive abnormalities included loss of 3p12-3p22 in 3 of
  6 HPC-7-linked cases and in 2 of 3 X-linked cases and gain of 6q11-6q21 in 2 each
  of HPC-1 and X-linked tumors. In conclusion, laser microdissection, DOP-PCR, and
  CGH is a feasible method for analysis of paraffin-embedded prostate tumors. This
  study provides preliminary data suggesting that familial prostate cancer harbors
  some unique genetic changes when compared with sporadic prostate tumors.
