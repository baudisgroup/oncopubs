abstract: Uterine cervix carcinoma is the second most common female malignancy worldwide
  and a major health problem in Mexico, representing the primary cause of death among
  the Mexican female population. High risk human papillomavirus HPV infection is considered
  to be the most important risk factor for the development of this tumor and cervical
  carcinoma derived cell lines are very useful models for the study of viral carcinogenesis.
  Comparative Genomic Hybridization CGH experiments have detected a specific pattern
  of chromosomal imbalances during cervical cancer progression, indicating chromosomal
  regions that might contain genes that are important for cervical transformation.
