abstract: A high-resolution genomic profiling and comprehensive targeted analysis
  of INI1 SMARCB1 of a large series of pediatric rhabdoid tumors was done. The aim
  was to identify regions of copy number change and loss of heterozygosity LOH that
  might pinpoint additional loci involved in the development or progression of rhabdoid
  tumors and define the spectrum of genomic alterations of INI1 in this malignancy.
