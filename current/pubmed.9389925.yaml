abstract: 'Gain of chromosome arm 17q has recently been reported in neuroblastoma
  tumours. We analysed 17q status in relation to other known prognostic features and
  clinical outcome in a series of 45 tumours. Chromosome 17 status was detected by
  cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridisation FISH anc comparative genomic
  hybridisation CGH and correlated with other clinical and genetic factors. Survival
  analysis was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier estimation. Twenty-eight out of 45 tumours
  showed 17q gain, and this was associated with established indicators of poor prognosis
  stage 4 disease P amp lt 0.001 , age above 1 year at diagnosis P amp lt 0.001 ,
  1p deletion P amp lt 0.01 , MYCN amplification P 0.03 and diploidy tetraploidy P
  0.04 . 17q gain was associated with poor outcome: 3-year survival was 13.5 compared
  with 100 for tumours without 17q gain P 0.0001 and progression-free survival PFS
  was 8.1 after 3 years compared with 83 for 17q normal tumours P 0.0001 . PFS in
  28 MYCN non-amplified patients indicated that 17q status has discriminatory power
  within this group: PFS 0 for 17q gain n 14 versus 100 for normal 17q n 14 P 0.0001
  . This study indicates that 17q changes have prognostic significance in neuroblastoma
  and should be a target for molecular cytogenetic detection at diagnosis.'
