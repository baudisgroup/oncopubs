abstract: Traditional in vitro culturing of tumor cells has been shown to induce changes
  so that cultures no longer represent the tumor of origin. Serum-free culturing conditions
  are used in a variety of cancers to propagate stem-like cells in vitro. Limited
  reports, however, exist on the effects of such propagation. We have compared cells
  from brain tumor biopsies cultivated under serum-free conditions at passages 2 and
  10 to describe the effects of in vitro culturing. We were able to establish cell
  lines from 7 of 10 biopsies from patients with glioblastoma. The cell lines adapted
  to conditions and had 2.2 times increased population doubling rate at later passages.
  Karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed that all examined
  cell lines had cytogenetic aberrations commonly found in glioblastomas, and there
  were only minor differences between tumor and early and late passages in the same
  culture. Whole-transcriptome analysis shows that tumors had interindividual differences.
  Changes in the overall expression patterns through passaging were modest, with a
  significant change in only 14 genes the variation among cultures was, however, reduced
  through passages. The ability to differentiate differed among tumors but was maintained
  throughout passaging. The cells initiated tumors upon transplantation to immunodeficient
  mice with differing phenotypes, but a given cell culture maintained tumor phenotype
  after serial cultivation. The cultures established maintained individual characteristics
  specific to culture identity. Thus, each cell culture reflects an image of the tumor--or
  a personalized model--from which it was derived and remains representative after
  moderate expansion.
