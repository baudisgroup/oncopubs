abstract: Cancers frequently arise as a result of an acquired genomic instability
  and the subsequent clonal evolution of neoplastic cells with variable patterns of
  genetic aberrations. Thus, the presence and behaviors of distinct clonal populations
  in each patients tumor may underlie multiple clinical phenotypes in cancers. We
  applied DNA content-based flow sorting to identify and isolate the nuclei of clonal
  populations from tumor biopsies, which was coupled with array CGH and targeted resequencing.
  The results produced high-definition genomic profiles of clonal populations from
  40 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and a set of prostate adenocarcinomas, including serial
  biopsies from a patient who progressed to androgen-independent metastatic disease.
  The genomes of clonal populations were found to have patient-specific aberrations
  of clinical relevance. Furthermore, we identified genomic aberrations specific to
  therapeutically responsive and resistant clones arising during the evolution of
  androgen-independent metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. We also distinguished divergent
  clonal populations within single biopsies and mapped aberrations in multiple aneuploid
  populations arising in primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We propose
  that our high-definition analyses of the genomes of distinct clonal populations
  of cancer cells in patients in vivo can help guide diagnoses and tailor approaches
  to personalized treatment.
