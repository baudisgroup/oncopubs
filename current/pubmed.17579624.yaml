abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the accumulation of genetic
  alterations during metachronous and or synchronous development of multifocal low-grade
  superficial urothelial tumours in the same patient, by using array-based comparative
  genomic hybridisation array-CGH and FGFR mutation analysis. We analysed 24 tumours
  pTa-1 G1-2 from five patients. We had previously identified a clonal relationship
  among the tumours of each patient by microsatellite analysis. This time, unsupervised
  hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the tumours from each patient were clustered
  together independently of the tumours from the other patients. All of the tumours
  from a single patient showed a set of 2-7 identical regional or whole-arm chromosomal
  changes. In addition, several individual alterations were also found. Cladistic
  diagrams revealed that the accumulation of genetic alterations could not be explained
  by a linear model, and the existence of a hypothetical precursor cell was assumed
  in four patients. In some cases, FGFR mutation seemed to occur later during multifocal
  tumour development. Taken together, these findings suggest that low-grade superficial
  urothelial tumours accumulate minor genetic alterations during multifocal development,
  although these tumours are genetically stable.
