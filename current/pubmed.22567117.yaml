abstract: Dense genotype data can be used to detect chromosome fragments inherited
  from a common ancestor in apparently unrelated individuals. A disease-causing mutation
  inherited from a common founder may thus be detected by searching for a common haplotype
  signature in a sample population of patients. We present here FounderTracker, a
  computational method for the genome-wide detection of founder mutations in cancer
  using dense tumor SNP profiles. Our method is based on two assumptions. First, the
  wild-type allele frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumors
  of germline mutation carriers. Second, the overlap between the ancestral chromosome
  fragments inherited from a common founder will define a minimal haplotype conserved
  in each patient carrying the founder mutation. Our approach thus relies on the detection
  of haplotypes with significant identity by descent (IBD) sharing within recurrent
  regions of LOH to highlight genomic loci likely to harbor a founder mutation. We
  validated this approach by analyzing two real cancer data sets in which we successfully
  identified founder mutations of well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. We then
  used simulated data to evaluate the ability of our method to detect IBD tracts as
  a function of their size and frequency. We show that FounderTracker can detect haplotypes
  of low prevalence with high power and specificity, significantly outperforming existing
  methods. FounderTracker is thus a powerful tool for discovering unknown founder
  mutations that may explain part of the "missing" heritability in cancer. This method
  is freely available and can be used online at the FounderTracker website.
