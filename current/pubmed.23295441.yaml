abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma, the second most common liver cancer, can be classified
  as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We
  performed an integrative genomic analysis of ICC samples from a large series of
  patients.We performed a gene expression profile, high-density single-nucleotide
  polymorphism array, and mutation analyses using formalin-fixed ICC samples from
  149 patients. Associations with clinicopathologic traits and patient outcomes were
  examined for 119 cases. Class discovery was based on a non-negative matrix factorization
  algorithm and significant copy number variations were identified by Genomic Identification
  of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis
  was used to identify signaling pathways activated in specific molecular classes
  of tumors, and to analyze their genomic overlap with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).We
  identified 2 main biological classes of ICC. The inflammation class (38% of ICCs)
  is characterized by activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, overexpression
  of cytokines, and STAT3 activation. The proliferation class (62%) is characterized
  by activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (including RAS, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, and MET), DNA amplifications at 11q13.2, deletions at 14q22.1, mutations
  in KRAS and BRAF, and gene expression signatures previously associated with poor
  outcomes for patients with HCC. Copy number variation-based clustering was able
  to refine these molecular groups further. We identified high-level amplifications
  in 5 regions, including 1p13 (9%) and 11q13.2 (4%), and several focal deletions,
  such as 9p21.3 (18%) and 14q22.1 (12% in coding regions for the SAV1 tumor suppressor).
  In a complementary approach, we identified a gene expression signature that was
  associated with reduced survival times of patients with ICC; this signature was
  enriched in the proliferation class (P < .001).We used an integrative genomic analysis
  to identify 2 classes of ICC. The proliferation class has specific copy number alterations,
  activation of oncogenic pathways, and is associated with worse outcome. Different
  classes of ICC, based on molecular features, therefore might require different treatment
  approaches.
