abstract: Our aim was to identify frequent genomic aberrations in both esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal dysplasia and to discover important
  copy number-driving genes and microRNAs (miRNA) in ESCC.  We conducted array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) on 59 ESCC resection samples and 16
  dysplasia biopsy samples. Expression of genes at 11q13.3 was analyzed by real-time
  PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Integrated analysis was conducted to
  identify genes or miRNAs with copy number-expression correlations.  Array CGH identified
  11 amplifications and eight homozygous deletions in ESCC. Integrated analysis of
  array CGH data with matched gene expression microarray data showed that 90 overexpressed
  genes and 24 underexpressed genes were consistent with DNA copy number changes,
  including 12 copy number-driving miRNAs. In esophageal dysplasia, six gains, four
  losses, 12 amplifications, and four homozygous deletions were detected. Amplifications
  of 7p11.2 and 11q13.2-11q13.3 (CCND1) and homozygous deletion at 9p21.3 (CDKN2A)
  were consistent genomic changes in both dysplasia and carcinoma. ANO1 at 11q13.3
  was overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in tumors, and higher mRNA expression
  was correlated with the copy number increase. In particular, ANO1 expression was
  elevated in moderate dysplasia compared with normal esophageal epithelium. IHC revealed
  that ANO1 overexpression was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and
  advanced clinical stage. Knockdown of ANO1 significantly inhibited the proliferation
  of KYSE30 and KYSE510 cells.  Copy number aberrations in both esophageal dysplasia
  and ESCC may be useful as potential biomarkers for early detection. In addition,
  ANO1 may be a candidate target gene in esophageal tumorigenesis.
