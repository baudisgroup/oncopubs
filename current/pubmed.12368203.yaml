abstract: Multiple parathyroid tumors, as opposed to hyperplasia, have been reported
  in a subset of patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism PHPT . It is not
  clear whether these multiple tumors are representative of a neoplastic process or
  whether they merely represent hyperplasia that has affected the parathyroid glands
  differentially and resulted in asynchronous growth. The molecular genetic techniques
  of comparative genomic hybridization CGH , loss of heterozygosity LOH , and MEN1
  mutation analysis were performed on a series of five patients with multiglandular
  PHPT, each of which had two parathyroid tumors removed. Analysis of these multiple
  parathyroid tumors from patients with PHPT revealed that independent genetic events
  were associated with the development of a subset of these tumors. The DNA sequence
  copy number changes, identified by CGH analyses, either involved different chromosomal
  regions in the paired glands of a patient two patients , or those regions implicated
  in one gland were not changed in a second gland from the same patient two patients
  . Each of the three patients exhibiting LOH demonstrated different changes between
  the paired glands. Where LOH was detected in one gland from a patient, the other
  gland from the same patient either exhibited no allelic loss or the loss detected
  was in another region. Each of the three tumors exhibiting LOH at 11q13 was found
  to contain a somatic MEN1 mutation in the remaining allele, however these mutations
  were not present in the germline or in the paired gland from the same patient. Although
  it is possible that a separate series of genetic changes has arisen randomly in
  two separate glands within the same individual, it seems more likely that the development
  of these multiple tumors has arisen because of the involvement of other unknown
  factors. These factors may be genetic such as the involvement of one or more germline
  mutations in an unknown low-penetrance gene s , germline mosaicism or alterations
  in calcium-sensing receptor gene s , epigenetic, physiological, or environmental.
