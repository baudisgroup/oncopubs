abstract: Molecular methods for predicting prognosis in patients with oral cavity
  squamous cell carcinoma OSCC are urgently needed, considering its high recurrence
  rate and tendency for metastasis. The present study investigated the genetic basis
  of variations in gene expression associated with poor prognosis in OSCC using Affymetrix
  SNP 6.0 and Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. We identified recurrent
  DNA amplifications scattered from 8q22.2 to 8q24.3 in 112 OSCC specimens. These
  amplicons demonstrated significant associations with increased incidence of extracapsular
  spread, development of second primary malignancies, and poor survival. Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization, in a validation panel consisting of 295 cases, confirmed
  these associations. Assessment of the effects of copy number variations CNVs on
  genome-wide variations in gene expression identified a total of 85 CNV-associated
  transcripts enriched in the MYC-centered regulatory network. Twenty-four transcripts
  associated with increased risk of second primary malignancies, tumor relapse, and
  poor survival. Besides MYC itself, a novel dysregulated MYC module plays a key role
  in OSCC carcinogenesis. This study identified a candidate molecular signature associated
  with poor prognosis in OSCC patients, which may ultimately facilitate patient-tailored
  selection of therapeutic strategies.
