abstract: Although information about the molecular pathogenesis of Waldenstrï¿½m macroglobulinemia
  (WM) has significantly advanced, the precise cell of origin and the mechanisms behind
  WM transformation from immunoglobulin-M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
  significance (MGUS) remain undetermined. Here, we undertook an integrative phenotypic,
  molecular, and genomic approach to study clonal B cells from newly diagnosed patients
  with IgM MGUS (n = 22), smoldering (n = 16), and symptomatic WM (n = 11). Through
  principal component analysis of multidimensional flow cytometry data, we demonstrated
  highly overlapping phenotypic profiles for clonal B cells from IgM MGUS, smoldering,
  and symptomatic WM patients. Similarly, virtually no genes were significantly deregulated
  between fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted clonal B cells from the 3 disease
  groups. Interestingly, the transcriptome of the Waldenstrï¿½m B-cell clone was highly
  different than that of normal CD25(-)CD22(+) B cells, whereas significantly less
  genes were differentially expressed and specific WM pathways normalized once the
  transcriptome of the Waldenstrï¿½m B-cell clone was compared with its normal phenotypic
  (CD25(+)CD22(+low)) B-cell counterpart. The frequency of specific copy number abnormalities
  [+4, del(6q23.3-6q25.3), +12, and +18q11-18q23] progressively increased from IgM
  MGUS and smoldering WM vs symptomatic WM (18% vs 20% and 73%, respectively; P =
  .008), suggesting a multistep transformation of clonal B cells that, albeit benign
  (ie, IgM MGUS and smoldering WM), already harbor the phenotypic and molecular signatures
  of the malignant Waldenstrï¿½m clone.  ï¿½ 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.
