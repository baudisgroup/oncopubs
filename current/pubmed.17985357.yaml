abstract: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients have an increased risk of certain
  secondary cancers, the most common of which are lung cancers, especially small cell
  lung cancer. To reveal the molecular pathogenesis underlying CTCL-associated lung
  cancer, we analyzed genomic aberrations in CTCL-associated and reference lung cancer
  samples. DNA derived from microdissected lung cancer cells of five CTCL-associated
  lung cancers and five reference lung cancers without CTCL association was analyzed
  by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH),
  immunohistochemistry (IHC), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis were performed
  for selected genes. In CTCL-associated lung cancer, CGH revealed chromosomal aberrations
  characterizing both lung cancer and CTCL, but also losses of 1p, and 19, and gains
  of 4q and 7, hallmarks of CTCL. LOH for the CTCL-associated NAV3 gene was detected
  in two of the four informative primary lung cancers. FISH revealed increased copy
  number of the KIT gene in 3/4 of CTCL-associated lung cancers and 1/5 of primary
  lung cancers. PDGFRA and VEGFR2 copy numbers were also increased. IHC showed moderate
  KIT expression when the gene copy number was increased. CTCL-associated lung cancer
  shows chromosomal aberrations different from primary lung cancer, especially amplifications
  of 4q, a chromosome arm frequently deleted in the latter tumor type. Copy numbers
  and expression of selected genes in chromosome 4 differed between CTCL-associated
  and reference lung cancers. These preliminary observations warrant further prospective
  studies to identify the common underlying factors between CTCL and CTCL-associated
  lung cancer.  (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
