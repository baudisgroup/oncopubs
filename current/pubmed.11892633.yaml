abstract: Despite the rapid increase in knowledge concerning the genetic basis of
  malignant progression in astrocytic tumors, progression of oligodendroglial tumors
  including both pure oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas is still poorly
  understood. The aim of the present study is the elucidation of chromosomal imbalances
  involved in the progression of oligodendroglial tumors toward malignancy.
