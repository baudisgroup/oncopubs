abstract: 'Neuroblastoma behavior is variable and outcome partially depends on genetic
  factors. However, tumors that lack high-risk factors such as MYCN amplification
  or 1p deletion may progress, possibly due to other genetic aberrations. Comparative
  genomic hybridization summarizes DNA copy number abnormalities in a tumor by mapping
  them to their positions on normal metaphase chromosomes. We analyzed 29 tumors from
  nearly equal proportions of children with stage I, II, III, IV, and IV-S disease
  by comparative genomic hybridization. We found two classes of copy number abnormalities:
  whole chromosome and partial chromosome. Whole chromosome losses were frequent at
  11, 14, and X. The most frequent partial chromosome losses were on 1p and 11q. Gains
  were most frequent on chromosome 17 72 of cases . The two patterns of gain for this
  chromosome were whole 17 gain and 17q gain, with 17q21-qter as a minimal common
  region of gain. Other common gains were on chromosomes 7, 6, and 18. High level
  amplifications were detected at 2p23-25 MYCN region , at 4q33-35, and at 6p11-22.
  Chromosome 17q gains were associated with 1p and or 11q deletions and advanced stage.
  The high frequency of chromosome 17 gain and its association with bad prognostic
  factors suggest an important role for this chromosome in the development of neuroblastoma.'
