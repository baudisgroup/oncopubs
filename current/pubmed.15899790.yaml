abstract: Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare soft tissue neoplasm of uncertain lineage
  that usually arises in the distal extremities of adults, presents a high rate of
  recurrences and metastases and frequently poses diagnostic dilemmas. The recently
  reported large-cell amp quot proximal-type amp quot variant is characterized by
  increased aggressiveness, deep location, preferential occurrence in proximal axial
  regions of older patients, and rhabdoid features. Previous cytogenetic studies indicated
  that the most frequent alterations associated with this tumor entity affect chromosome
  22. In this study, combined spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization,
  and array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses of two proximal-type
  cases harboring a rearrangement involving 10q26 and 22q11 revealed that the 22q11
  breakpoints were located in a 150-kb region containing the SMARCB1 INI1 gene, and
  that homozygous deletion of the gene was present in the tumor tissue. The SMARCB1
  INI1 gene encodes for an invariant subunit of SWI SNF chromatin remodeling complex
  and has been previously reported to act as a tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated
  in infantile malignant rhabdoid tumors. We analyzed SMARCB1 INI1 gene status in
  nine additional epithelioid sarcoma cases four proximal types and five conventional
  types and altogether we identified deletions of SMARCB1 INI1 gene in 5 of 11 cases,
  all proximal types. We confirmed and further extended the number of cases with SMARCB1
  INI1 inactivation to 6 of 11 cases, by real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA
  expression and by SMARCB1 INI1 immunohistochemistry. Overall, these results point
  to SMARCB1 INI1 gene involvement in the genesis and or progression of epithelioid
  sarcomas. Analysis of larger series of epithelioid sarcomas will be necessary to
  highlight putative clinically relevant features related to SMARCB1 INI1 inactivation.
