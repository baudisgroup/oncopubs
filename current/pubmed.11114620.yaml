abstract: Determination of the genetic composition of papillary thyroid cancers may
  help explain differences in observed clinical behavior. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH is a novel molecular cytogenetic assay that allows simultaneous detection of
  gains, losses, and amplification of genetic information, making it an ideal screening
  tool. The aim of this study was to identify genetic aberrations occurring in papillary
  thyroid cancers by using CGH analysis.
