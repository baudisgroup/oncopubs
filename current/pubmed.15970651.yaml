abstract: The genetic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of lung
  squamous cell carcinoma SCC , the major subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, are
  still unknown. To better understand this disease, we studied the association between
  genetic alterations and the progression of lung SCC.
