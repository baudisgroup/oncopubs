abstract: Lack of remission or early relapse remains a major clinical issue in diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with 30% of patients failing standard of care. Although
  clinical factors and molecular signatures can partially predict DLBCL outcome, additional
  information is needed to identify high-risk patients, particularly biologic factors
  that might ultimately be amenable to intervention. Using whole-exome sequencing
  data from 51 newly diagnosed and immunochemotherapy-treated DLBCL patients, we evaluated
  the association of somatic genomic alterations with patient outcome, defined as
  failure to achieve event-free survival at 24 months after diagnosis (EFS24). We
  identified 16 genes with mutations, 374 with copy number gains and 151 with copy
  number losses that were associated with failure to achieve EFS24 (P<0.05). Except
  for FOXO1 and CIITA, known driver mutations did not correlate with EFS24. Gene losses
  were localized to 6q21-6q24.2, and gains to 3q13.12-3q29, 11q23.1-11q23.3 and 19q13.12-19q13.43.
  Globally, the number of gains was highly associated with poor outcome (P=7.4 ï¿½
  10(-12)) and when combined with FOXO1 mutations identified 77% of cases that failed
  to achieve EFS24. One gene (SLC22A16) at 6q21, a doxorubicin transporter, was lost
  in 54% of EFS24 failures and our findings suggest it functions as a doxorubicin
  transporter in DLBCL cells.
