abstract: We performed two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to detect
  the numbers of chromosomes 1 and 17, 1p deletion, and 17q gain in 177 neuroblastomas,
  including 101 tumors that were found by a mass-screening program for infants. Sixty-eight
  tumors with disomy 1 or tetrasomy 1 were classified as the Dis1 group, and 109 tumors
  with trisomy 1, pentasomy 1, or a mixed population of cells with trisomy 1 and cells
  with tetrasomy 1 were classified as the Tris1 group. 17q gain was the most frequent
  genetic event, followed by 1p deletion, and MYCN amplification in both Dis1 and
  Tris1 tumors. However, the incidence of all the genetic events was higher in Dis1
  tumors than in Tris1 tumors. These findings suggest that Tris1 tumors are more resistant
  to acquiring the genetic events than are Dis1 tumors. In addition, there was an
  accumulation of genetic events in more advanced stages, with the exception of a
  high incidence of 17q gain in the stage IVS Tris1 tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis, which was performed in 59 of the 177 tumors, showed that chromosomes partially
  lost or gained in Dis1 tumors coincided with chromosomes totally lost or gained
  in Tris1 tumors. Dis1 and Tris1 tumors were considered to have near-diploid tetraploid
  and near-triploid pentaploid chromosome numbers, respectively. These findings suggest
  that the same tumor-suppressor genes or oncogenes may be involved in the development
  and progression of both high- and low-risk neuroblastomas, and that the ploidy state
  of the tumor plays a fundamental role in the heterogeneous behavior.
