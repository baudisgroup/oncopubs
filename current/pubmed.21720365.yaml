abstract: A catalogue of molecular aberrations that cause ovarian cancer is critical
  for developing and deploying therapies that will improve patients apos lives. The
  Cancer Genome Atlas project has analysed messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression,
  promoter methylation and DNA copy number in 489 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas
  and the DNA sequences of exons from coding genes in 316 of these tumours. Here we
  report that high-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by TP53 mutations
  in almost all tumours 96 low prevalence but statistically recurrent somatic mutations
  in nine further genes including NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, RB1 and CDK12 113 significant
  focal DNA copy number aberrations and promoter methylation events involving 168
  genes. Analyses delineated four ovarian cancer transcriptional subtypes, three microRNA
  subtypes, four promoter methylation subtypes and a transcriptional signature associated
  with survival duration, and shed new light on the impact that tumours with BRCA1
  2 BRCA1 or BRCA2 and CCNE1 aberrations have on survival. Pathway analyses suggested
  that homologous recombination is defective in about half of the tumours analysed,
  and that NOTCH and FOXM1 signalling are involved in serous ovarian cancer pathophysiology.
