abstract: Although medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor,
  its molecular underpinnings are largely unknown. We have identified rare, recurrent
  homozygous deletions of Kruppel-like Factor 4 KLF4 in medulloblastoma using high-resolution
  single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, digital karyotyping, and genomic real-time
  polymerase chain reaction PCR . Furthermore, we show that there is loss of physiological
  KLF4 expression in more than 40 of primary medulloblastomas both at the RNA and
  protein levels. Medulloblastoma cell lines drastically increase the expression of
  KLF4 in response to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and demonstrate dense
  methylation of the promoter CpG island by bisulfite sequencing. Methylation-specific
  PCR targeting the KLF4 promoter demonstrates CpG methylation in approximately 16
  of primary medulloblastomas. Reexpression of KLF4 in the D283 medulloblastoma cell
  line results in significant growth suppression both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude
  that KLF4 is inactivated by either genetic or epigenetic mechanisms in a large subset
  of medulloblastomas and that it likely functions as a tumor suppressor gene in the
  pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.
