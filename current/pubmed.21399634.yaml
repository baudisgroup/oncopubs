abstract: Abnormal epigenetic regulation has been implicated in oncogenesis. We report
  here the identification of somatic mutations by exome sequencing in acute monocytic
  leukemia, the M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia AML-M5 . We discovered mutations
  in DNMT3A encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A in 23 of 112 20.5 cases. The DNMT3A
  mutants showed reduced enzymatic activity or aberrant affinity to histone H3 in
  vitro. Notably, there were alterations of DNA methylation patterns and or gene expression
  profiles such as HOXB genes in samples with DNMT3A mutations as compared with those
  without such changes. Leukemias with DNMT3A mutations constituted a group of poor
  prognosis with elderly disease onset and of promonocytic as well as monocytic predominance
  among AML-M5 individuals. Screening other leukemia subtypes showed Arg882 alterations
  in 13.6 of acute myelomonocytic leukemia AML-M4 cases. Our work suggests a contribution
  of aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity to the pathogenesis of acute monocytic
  leukemia and provides a useful new biomarker for relevant cases.
