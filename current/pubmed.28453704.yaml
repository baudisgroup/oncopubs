abstract: "HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification and its corresponding overexpression are
  present in 15-30% of invasive breast cancers. While HER2-targeted agents are effective
  treatments, resistance remains a major cause of death. The American College of Surgeons
  Oncology Group Z1041 trial (NCT00513292) was designed to compare the pathologic
  complete response (pCR) rate of distinct regimens of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
  trastuzumab, but ultimately identified no difference.In supplement to tissues from
  37 Z1041 cases, 11 similarly treated cases were obtained from a single institution
  study (NCT00353483). We have extracted genomic DNA from both pre-treatment tumor
  biopsies and blood of these 48 cases, and performed whole genome (WGS) and exome
  sequencing. Coincident with these efforts, we have generated RNA-seq profiles from
  42 of the tumor biopsies. Among patients in this cohort, 24 (50%) achieved a pCR.We
  have characterized the genomic landscape of HER2-positive breast cancer and investigated
  associations between genomic features and pCR. Cases assigned to the HER2-enriched
  subtype by RNA-seq analysis were more likely to achieve a pCR compared to the luminal,
  basal-like, or normal-like subtypes (19/27 versus 3/15; P창\x80\x89=창\x80\x890.0032).
  Mutational events led to the generation of putatively active neoantigens, but were
  overall not associated with pCR. ERBB2 and GRB7 were the genes most commonly observed
  in fusion events, and genomic copy number analysis of the ERBB2 locus indicated
  that cases with either no observable or low-level ERBB2 amplification were less
  likely to achieve a pCR (7/8 versus 17/40; P창\x80\x89=창\x80\x890.048). Moreover,
  among cases that achieved a pCR, tumors consistently expressed immune signatures
  that may contribute to therapeutic response.The identification of these features
  suggests that it may be possible to predict, at the time of diagnosis, those HER2-positive
  breast cancer patients who will not respond to treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab.NCT00513292,
  NCT00353483."
