abstract: Around 30 of all stage II colon cancer patients will relapse and die of
  their disease. At present no objective parameters to identify high-risk stage II
  colon cancer patients, who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, have been established.
  With traditional histopathological features definition of high-risk stage II colon
  cancer patients is inaccurate. Therefore more objective and robust markers for prediction
  of relapse are needed. DNA copy number aberrations have proven to be robust prognostic
  markers, but have not yet been investigated for this specific group of patients.
  The aim of the present study was to identify chromosomal aberrations that can predict
  relapse of tumor in patients with stage II colon cancer.
