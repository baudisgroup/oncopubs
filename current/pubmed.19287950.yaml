abstract: Neuroblastoma shows complex patterns of genetic aberrations including MYCN
  amplification, deletion of chromosome 1p or 11q, and gain of chromosome 17q. The
  17q gain is frequently observed in high-risk neuroblastomas, however, the candidate
  genes still remain elusive. In the present study, we integrated the data of comparative
  genomic hybridization of 236 tumors by BAC array and expression profiling of 136
  tumors by using the in-house cDNA microarray carrying 5,340 genes derived from primary
  neuroblastomas. A novel candidate gene mapped to chromosome 17q25.1 with two splicing
  variants, Nbla10727 and Nbla12061, was identified. The transcript size appeared
  to be 2.3 kb by Northern blot, however, the cDNA sequences had no obvious open reading
  frame. The protein product was undetectable by both in vivo and in vitro translation
  assays, suggesting that the transcript might not encode any protein product. Therefore,
  we named it as ncRAN non-coding RNA expressed in aggressive neuroblastoma . In analysis
  of 70 patients with sporadic neuroblastoma, the high levels of ncRAN mRNA expression
  were significantly associated with poor outcome of the patients p amp lt 0.001 .
  The multivariate analysis showed that expression of ncRAN mRNA was an independent
  prognostic factor among age, stage, origin and MYCN expression. Ectopic expression
  of ncRAN induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells in soft agar, while knockdown of
  endogenous ncRAN with RNA interference significantly inhibited cell growth in SH-SY5Y
  cells. Collectively, our results suggest that ncRAN may be a novel non-coding RNA
  mapped to the region of 17q gain and act like an oncogene in aggressive neuroblastomas.
