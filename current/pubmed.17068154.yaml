abstract: CD4+CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm (CD4+CD56+HN) is an aggressive hematopoietic
  malignancy with distinct clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features that commonly
  involve the skin, bone marrow, and blood. Differentiation from cutaneous myelomonocytic
  leukemia (c-AML) may be exceedingly difficult and requires extensive phenotyping.
  The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of CD4+CD56+HN are largely
  unresolved. Moreover, recurrent chromosomal alterations have not yet been precisely
  defined in CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML. In the present study an integrated genomic analysis
  using expression profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
  was performed on lesional skin biopsy samples of patients with CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML.
  Our results demonstrate that CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML show distinct gene-expression
  profiles and distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations. CD4+CD56+HN is characterized
  by recurrent deletion of regions on chromosome 4 (4q34), chromosome 9 (9p13-p11
  and 9q12-q34), and chromosome 13 (13q12-q31) that contain several tumor suppressor
  genes with diminished expression (Rb1, LATS2). Elevated expression of the oncogenes
  HES6, RUNX2, and FLT3 was found but was not associated with genomic amplification.
  We noted high expression of various plasmacytoid dendritic-cell (pDC)-related genes,
  pointing to the cell of origin of this malignancy.
