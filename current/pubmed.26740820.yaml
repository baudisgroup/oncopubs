abstract: 'Deletion of 13q14 is the most common cytogenetic change in chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and is detected in about 50ï¿½% of
  patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which can reveal presence
  of del(13)(q14) and mono- or biallelic deletion status without information about
  the size of the lost region. Array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can detect submicroscopic copy number changes,
  loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and uniparental disomy (UPD) regions. The purpose of
  this study was detection of the size of del(13)(q14) deletion in our group of patients,
  comparing the size of the monoallelic and biallelic deletions, detection of LOH
  and UPD regions.  We have investigated 40 CLL/SLL patients by karyotype, FISH and
  CGH and SNP array. Mutational status was of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region
  (IGVH) was also examined. The size of deletion ranged from 348,12 Kb to 38.97ï¿½Mb.
  Detected minimal deleted region comprised genes: TRIM13, miR-3613, KCNRG, DLEU2,
  miR-16-1, miR-15a, DLEU1. The RB1 deletions were detected in 41ï¿½% of cases. The
  average size in monoallelic 13q14 deletion group was 7,2ï¿½Mb while in biallelic
  group was 4,8ï¿½Mb. In two cases 13q14 deletions were located in the bigger UPD
  regions.  Our results indicate that bigger deletion including RB1 or presence of
  biallelic 13q14 deletion is not sufficient to be considered as adverse prognostic
  factor in CLL/SLL. CytoSure Haematological Cancer and SNP array (8x60k) can precisely
  detect recurrent copy number changes with known prognostic significance in CLL/SLL
  as well as other chromosomal imbalances. The big advantage of this array is simultaneous
  detection of LOH and UPD regions during the same test.'
