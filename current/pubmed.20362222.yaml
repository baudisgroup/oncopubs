abstract: Women with clinically node-negative breast cancer have a better prognosis
  than do those with axillary lymph node metastasis. Nonetheless, approximately 20
  of node-negative patients die within 15 years of diagnosis, and thus additional
  prognostic markers are greatly needed. To identify specific copy number alterations
  CNAs that differed in frequency between 10-year survivors and deceased patients
  with node-negative breast cancer, array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was
  applied to 41 primary node-negative breast tumors. Fishers exact test was used to
  identify significantly different CNAs between 10-year survivors and deceased patients.
  Losses at 8p21.2 approximately p21.3, 8p23.1 approximately p23.2, Xp21.3, and Xp22.31
  approximately p22.33 were significantly more common in tumors from deceased patients,
  suggesting that these alterations may contribute to tumor aggressiveness. Gains
  at 1q25.2 approximately q25.3 and 1q31.3 approximately q41 were more prevalent in
  tumors from survivors specific gains at these genomic regions may inhibit further
  tumor progression, resulting in a less aggressive form of node-negative breast cancer.
  Evaluation of the identified CNAs in an independent external data set verified the
  prognostic potential of the 1q31.3 approximately q41 region. Although further extensive
  validation is needed, the prognostic CNAs identified in this work may in time facilitate
  the clinical assessment of breast cancer.
