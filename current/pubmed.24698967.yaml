abstract: Spitz tumors represent a group of melanocytic neoplasms that typically affect
  young individuals. Microscopically, the lesions are composed of cytologically distinct
  spindle and epithelioid melanocytes, with a range in the architectural display or
  the cells, their nuclear features, and secondary epidermal or stromal changes. Recently,
  kinase fusions have been documented in a subset of Spitz tumors, but there is limited
  information on the clinical and pathologic features associated with those lesions.
  Here, we report a series of 17 patients 9 male, 8 female with spitzoid neoplasms
  showing ALK fusions 5 Spitz nevi and 12 atypical Spitz tumors . The patients ages
  ranged from 2 years to 35 years mean 17 y median 16 y . Most lesions were located
  on the lower extremities and presented clinically as polypoid nodules. All tumors
  were compound melanocytic proliferations with a predominant intradermal growth.
  Tumor thickness ranged from 1.1 to 6 mm mean 2.9 mm median 2.5 mm . The most characteristic
  histopathologic feature of the tumors seen in all but 2 lesions was a plexiform
  dermal growth of intersecting fascicles of fusiform melanocytes. All but 2 tumors
  were amelanotic. All tumors were strongly immunoreactive for ALK. The ALK rearrangements
  were confirmed in all cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , and the
  fusion partner was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction as TPM3
  tropomyosin 3 in 11 cases and DCTN1 dynactin 1 in 6 cases. None of the 8 tumors
  that were analyzed by FISH for copy number changes of 6p, 6q, 9p, or 11q met criteria
  for melanoma. Two patients underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy, and in both cases
  melanocyte nests were found in the subcapsular sinus of the node. Array comparative
  genomic hybridization of these 2 tumors revealed no chromosomal gains or losses.
  In conclusion, our study revealed that Spitz nevi tumors with ALK rearrangement
  show a characteristic plexiform morphology and that ALK immunohistochemistry and
  FISH enable the accurate identification of this morphologic and genetic distinct
  subset of spitzoid neoplasms.
