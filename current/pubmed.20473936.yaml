abstract: To identify novel glioma-associated pathomechanisms and molecular markers,
  we performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 131 diffuse
  astrocytic gliomas, including 87 primary glioblastomas pGBIV , 13 secondary glioblastomas
  sGBIV , 19 anaplastic astrocytomas AAIII and 12 diffuse astrocytomas AII . All tumors
  were additionally screened for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. Expression profiling was
  performed for 74 tumors 42 pGBIV, 11 sGBIV, 13 AAIII, 8 AII . Unsupervised and supervised
  bioinformatic analyses revealed distinct genomic and expression profiles separating
  pGBIV from the other entities. Classifier expression signatures were strongly associated
  with the IDH1 gene mutation status. Within pGBIV, the rare subtype of IDH1 mutant
  tumors shared expression profiles with IDH1 mutant sGBIV and was associated with
  longer overall survival compared with IDH1 wild-type tumors. In patients with IDH1
  wild-type pGBIV, PDGFRA gain or amplification as well as 19q gain were associated
  with patient outcome. Array-CGH analysis additionally revealed homozygous deletions
  of the FGFR2 gene at 10q26.13 in 2 pGBIV, with reduced FGFR2 mRNA levels being frequent
  in pGBIV and linked to poor outcome. In conclusion, we report that diffuse astrocytic
  gliomas can be separated into 2 major molecular groups with distinct genomic and
  mRNA profiles as well as IDH1 gene mutation status. In addition, our results suggest
  FGFR2 as a novel glioma-associated candidate tumor suppressor gene on the long arm
  of chromosome 10.
