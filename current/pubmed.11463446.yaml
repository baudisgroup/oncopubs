abstract: 'Genetic changes underlying the tumorigenesis of pituitary adenomas PA are
  poorly characterized. To search for characteristic genomic imbalances involved in
  PA, we examined 38 cases: 12 hormone-secreting HS and 26 non-functioning NF PA,
  by comparative genomic hybridization. The most frequent DNA copy number change in
  both kinds of tumors was loss of 13q. Gains of chromosomes 3, 7 and 14, 6p, and
  20q were more frequent in HSPA than in NFPA. These data indicate that the 13q region
  may harbor tumor suppressor genes determining the tumorigenesis of PA and gain in
  chromosome 3 may be related to hormone secretion. These findings provide a basis
  to search for candidate diagnostic markers of HSPA.'
