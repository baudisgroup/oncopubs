abstract: Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells, and its pathogenesis
  is poorly understood. Here we report the massively parallel sequencing of 38 tumour
  genomes and their comparison to matched normal DNAs. Several new and unexpected
  oncogenic mechanisms were suggested by the pattern of somatic mutation across the
  data set. These include the mutation of genes involved in protein translation seen
  in nearly half of the patients , genes involved in histone methylation, and genes
  involved in blood coagulation. In addition, a broader than anticipated role of NF-kappaB
  signalling was indicated by mutations in 11 members of the NF-kappaB pathway. Of
  potential immediate clinical relevance, activating mutations of the kinase BRAF
  were observed in 4 of patients, suggesting the evaluation of BRAF inhibitors in
  multiple myeloma clinical trials. These results indicate that cancer genome sequencing
  of large collections of samples will yield new insights into cancer not anticipated
  by existing knowledge.
