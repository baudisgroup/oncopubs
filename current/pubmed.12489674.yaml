abstract: To ascertain if a carcinoma-like component within a fibroblastic meningioma
  represented a metastatic carcinoma to a meningioma or malignant progression, we
  employed traditional immunohistochemical methods as well as comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH which compares chromosomal alterations. Vimentin and epithelial
  membrane antigen were strongly immunoreactive in both the fibroblastic and carcinoma-like
  components. The CGH profile in both components had similar chromosomal alterations,
  including losses of 1p, 14, 16p13-- amp gt p10 and 22. However, the CGH profiles
  from the fibroblastic component showed losses of 4p, 10q23-- amp gt q24 and 18,
  along with gains of 1q, 6q25-- amp gt qter and 13q32-- amp gt qter. The profile
  of the carcinoma-like component showed losses of chromosome 4, in addition to gains
  of 3p12-- amp gt q13.11, 5q14.3-- amp gt q23.2, 6pter-- amp gt p23, and 13q14.2--
  amp gt qter. CGH analysis of a biphasic malignant meningioma confirmed that the
  disparate histologic components were genetically related and likely derivative from
  a common precursor, demonstrating genetic instability and clonal expansion. Furthermore,
  CGH showed that the histologically appearing low-grade fibroblastic component had
  not solely the characteristic alterations of a benign meningioma but had already
  progressed to an atypical meningioma.
