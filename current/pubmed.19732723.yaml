abstract: Chronic myeloid leukemia CML is induced by BCR-ABL1 and can be effectively
  treated for many years with Imatinib until leukemia cells acquire drug resistance
  through BCR-ABL1 mutations and progress into fatal B lymphoid blast crisis LBC .
  Despite its clinical significance, the mechanism of progression into LBC is unknown.
  Here, we show that LBC but not CML cells express the B cell-specific mutator enzyme
  AID. We demonstrate that AID expression in CML cells promotes overall genetic instability
  by hypermutation of tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes. Importantly, our data
  uncover a causative role of AID activity in the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 mutations
  leading to Imatinib resistance, thus providing a rationale for the rapid development
  of drug resistance and blast crisis progression.
