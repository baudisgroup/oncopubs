abstract: The vast majority of familial ovarian cancers harbor a germline mutation
  in either the breast cancer gene BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes. However,
  mutations of these genes in sporadic ovarian cancer are rare. This suggests that
  in contrast to hereditary disease, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are not commonly involved in
  sporadic ovarian cancer and may indicate that there are two distinct pathways for
  the development of ovarian cancer. To characterize further differences between hereditary
  and sporadic cancers, the comparative genomic hybridization technique was employed
  to analyze changes in copy number of genetic material in a panel of 36 microdissected
  hereditary ovarian cancers. Gains at 8q23-qter 18 of 36, 5 cases with high-level
  amplifications , 3q26.3-qter 18 of 36, 2 cases with high-level amplifications ,
  11q22 11 of 36 and 2q31-32 8 of 36 were most frequent. Losses most frequently occurred
  in decreasing order of frequency on 8p21-pter 23 of 36 , 16q22-pter 19 of 36 , 22q13
  19 of 36 , 9q31-33 16 of 36 , 12q24 16 of 36 , 15q11-15 16 of 36 , 17p12-13 14 of
  36 , Xp21-22 14 of 36 , 20q13 13 of 36 , 15q24-25 12 of 36 , and 18q21 12 of 36
  . Comparison with the literature revealed that the majority of these genetic alterations
  are also common in sporadic ovarian cancer. Deletions of 15q11-15, 15q24-25, 8p21-ter,
  22q13, 12q24 and gains at 11q22, 13q22, and 17q23-25, however, appear to be specific
  to hereditary ovarian cancer. Aberrations at 15q11-15 and 15q24-25 have not yet
  been described in familial ovarian cancer. In these regions, important tumor suppressor
  genes, including the hRAD51 gene, are located. These and other yet unknown suppressor
  genes may be involved in a specific carcinogenic pathway for familial ovarian cancer
  and may explain the distinct clinical presentation and behavior of familial ovarian
  cancer.
