abstract: Chordoid gliomas are rare, slow-growing neoplasms of the anterior third
  ventricle. We reported a case of chordoid glioma in a 41-year-old man with obstructive
  hydrocephalus. Histologically, the tumor consisted of polygonal epithelioid cells
  admixed with elongated cells in a myxoid stroma. A prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate
  was present. The tumor cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP , epithelial
  membrane antigen EMA , vimentin, CD31, CD34, epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR
  and S100 but were negative for pankeratin and E-cadherin. The percentage of Ki67
  positive cells was approximately 3 . Weak p53 immunoreactivity was seen in less
  than 10 of the cells. Array comparative genomic hybridization performed on this
  case, as well as on four other archived cases, showed losses at several loci. Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH confirmed consistent genetic alterations at 9p21 and
  11q13. These are the fifth through ninth reported cases of chordoid gliomas with
  molecular characterization suggesting a distinct genetic origin from other gliomas.
