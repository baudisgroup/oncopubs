abstract: Aggressive adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma ATLL such as acute and lymphoma
  types are fatal diseases with poor prognosis. Although these 2 subtypes feature
  different clinicopathologic characteristics, no detailed comparative analyses of
  genomic genetic alterations have been reported. We performed array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization for 17 acute and 49 lymphoma cases as well as real-time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction PCR to identify the target genes of recurrently amplified
  regions. Comparison of the genome profiles of acute and lymphoma types revealed
  that the lymphoma type had significantly more frequent gains at 1q, 2p, 4q, 7p,
  and 7q, and losses of 10p, 13q, 16q, and 18p, whereas the acute type showed a gain
  of 3 3p. Of the recurrent high-level amplifications found at 1p36, 6p25, 7p22, 7q,
  and 14q32 in the lymphoma type, we were able to demonstrate that CARMA1 is a possible
  target gene of the 7p22 amplification for the lymphoma type but not for the acute
  type. Furthermore, we found BCL11B overexpression in the acute type regardless of
  the 14q32 gain amplification, but no or low expression of the gene in the lymphoma
  type. These results suggest that acute and lymphoma types are genomically distinct
  subtypes, and thus may develop tumors via distinct genetic pathways.
