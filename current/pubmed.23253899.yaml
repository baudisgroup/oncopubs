abstract: About 20% of breast cancers are characterized by amplification and overexpression
  of the HER2 oncogene. Although significant progress has been achieved for treating
  such patients with HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab, more than half of the patients respond
  poorly or become resistant to the treatment. Since the HER2 amplicon at 17q12 contains
  multiple genes, we have systematically explored the role of the HER2 co-amplified
  genes in breast cancer cell growth and their relation to trastuzumab resistance.
  We integrated aCGH data of the HER2 amplicon from 71 HER2 positive breast tumors
  and 10 cell lines with systematic functional RNA interference analysis of 23 core
  amplicon genes with several phenotypic endpoints in a panel of trastuzumab responding
  and non-responding HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Silencing of HER2 caused a
  greater growth arrest and apoptosis in the responding compared to the non-responding
  cell lines, indicating that the resistant cells are inherently less dependent on
  the HER2 pathway. Several other genes in the amplicon also showed a more pronounced
  effect when silenced; indicating that expression of HER2 co-amplified genes may
  be needed to sustain the growth of breast cancer cells. Importantly, co-silencing
  of STARD3, GRB7, PSMD3 and PERLD1 together with HER2 led to an additive inhibition
  of cell viability as well as induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that breast
  cancer cells may become addicted to the amplification of several genes that reside
  in the HER2 amplicon. The simultaneous targeting of these genes may increase the
  efficacy of the anti-HER2 therapies and possibly also counteract trastuzumab resistance.
  The observed additive effects seem to culminate to both apoptosis and cell proliferation
  pathways indicating that these pathways may be interesting targets for combinatorial
  treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.  Copyright ï¿½ 2012 Federation of European Biochemical
