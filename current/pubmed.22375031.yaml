abstract: Gene amplification is a tumor-specific event during malignant transformation.
  Recent studies have proposed a lineage-dependency addiction model of human cancer
  whereby amplification of certain lineage transcription factors predisposes a survival
  mechanism in tumor cells. These tumor cells are derived from tissues where the lineage
  factors play essential developmental and maintenance roles. Here, we show that recurrent
  amplification at 18q11.2 occurs in 21 of esophageal adenocarcinomas EAC . Utilization
  of an integrative genomic strategy reveals a single gene, the embryonic endoderm
  transcription factor GATA6, as the selected target of the amplification. Overexpression
  of GATA6 is found in EACs that contain gene amplification. We find that EAC patients
  whose tumors carry GATA6 amplification have a poorer survival. We show that ectopic
  expression of GATA6, together with FGFR2 isoform IIIb, increases anchorage-independent
  growth in immortalized Barretts esophageal cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing
  of GATA6 significantly reduces both cell proliferation and anchorage-independent
  growth in EAC cells. We further demonstrate that induction of apoptotic anoikis
  pathways is triggered upon silencing of GATA6 in EAC cells but not in esophageal
  squamous cells. We show that activation of p38 signaling and up-regulation of TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand are detected in apoptotic EAC cells upon GATA6 deprivation.
  We conclude that selective gene amplification of GATA6 during EAC development sustains
  oncogenic lineage-survival of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
