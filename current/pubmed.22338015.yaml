abstract: 'The high incidence of recurrence and unpredictable clinical outcome for
  pediatric ependymoma reflect the imprecision of current therapeutic staging and
  need for novel risk stratification markers. We therefore evaluated 1q25 gain across
  three age- and treatment-defined European clinical trial cohorts of pediatric intracranial
  ependymoma.  Frequency of 1q gain was assessed across 48 ependymomas (42 primary,
  6 recurrent) using Affymetrix 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Gain of
  1q25 was then evaluated by interphase FISH across 189 tumors treated on the Children''s
  Cancer Leukaemia Group/International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) CNS9204
  (n = 60) and BBSFOP (n = 65) adjuvant chemotherapy trials, or with primary postoperative
  radiotherapy (SIOP CNS9904/RT, n = 64). Results were correlated with clinical, histologic,
  and survival data.  Gain of 1q was the most frequent imbalance in primary (7/42,
  17%) and recurrent ependymomas (2/6, 33%). Gain of 1q25 was an independent predictor
  of tumor progression across the pooled trial cohort [HR = 2.55; 95% confidence interval
  (CI): 1.56-4.16; P = 0.0002] and both CNS9204 (HR = 4.03; 95% CI: 1.88-8.63) and
  BBSFOP (HR = 3.10; 95% CI: 1.22-7.86) groups. The only clinical variable associated
  with adverse outcome was incomplete tumor resection. Integrating tumor resectability
  with 1q25 status enabled stratification of cases into disease progression risk groups
  for all three trial cohorts.  This is the first study to validate a prognostic genomic
  marker for childhood ependymoma across independent trial groups. 1q25 gain predicts
  disease progression and can contribute to patient risk stratification. We advocate
  the prospective evaluation of 1q25 gain as an adverse marker in future international
  clinical trials.  ï¿½2012 AACR.'
