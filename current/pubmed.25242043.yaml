abstract: The casein kinase 1A1 gene (CSNK1A1) is a putative tumor suppressor gene
  located in the common deleted region for del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
  We generated a murine model with conditional inactivation of Csnk1a1 and found that
  Csnk1a1 haploinsufficiency induces hematopoietic stem cell expansion and a competitive
  repopulation advantage, whereas homozygous deletion induces hematopoietic stem cell
  failure. Based on this finding, we found that heterozygous inactivation of Csnk1a1
  sensitizes cells to a CSNK1 inhibitor relative to cells with two intact alleles.
  In addition, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in CSNK1A1 on the nondeleted
  allele of patients with del(5q) MDS. These studies demonstrate that CSNK1A1 plays
  a central role in the biology of del(5q) MDS and is a promising therapeutic target.
