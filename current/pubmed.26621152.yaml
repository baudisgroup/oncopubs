abstract: To identify potential biomarkers that may provide new therapeutic targets
  or prognostic indicators for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we investigated
  the three-dimensional (3D) organization of telomeres and cytoband 17q25.3 copy number
  in NSCLC tissues.  NSCLC paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 18 patients were
  assessed for 3D telomere organization by 3D nuclear telomere imaging followed by
  quantitative analysis. Patients were stratified by smoking, histology, and EGFR
  status. Cytoband 17q25.3 was examined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Data
  from comparative genomic hybridization and/or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays
  for cytoband 17q25.3 were obtained and correlated with Q-FISH and 3D telomere results.  3D
  telomeric profiling demonstrated that the smokers, EGFR-negative, and squamous cell
  carcinoma subgroups tended to have higher numbers of lower-intensity telomeres,
  indicative of shorter telomeres, as well as higher numbers of telomeric aggregations
  compared to non-smokers, EGFR-positive, and adenocarcinomas, respectively. Gains
  of cytoband 17q25.3 in conjunction with an increase in the control region 17p11.2
  were observed in 7 of 18 (38.9ï¿½%) patients, reflecting a gain of chromosome 17.
  Clonal gains of cytoband 17q25.3 were observed in 11 of 18 (61ï¿½%) patients, highlighting
  a potential biological significance for the genes in this region in NSCLC tumourigenesis.  The
  3D telomere profiles may differentiate NSCLC patients with different histologies,
  EGFR, and smoking statuses, rendering them a potential biomarker for distinguishing
  these clinically relevant histological and molecular subtypes of lung cancer. Highly
  frequent clonal gain of cytoband 17q25.3 was also demonstrated, suggesting an important
  biological role for the genes in this region.
