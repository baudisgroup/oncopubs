abstract: Oligodendroglial neoplasms are a subgroup of gliomas with distinctive morphological
  characteristics. In the present study we have evaluated a series of these tumors
  to define their molecular profiles and to determine whether there is a relationship
  between molecular genetic parameters and histological pattern in this tumor type.
  Loss of heterozygosity LOH for 1p and 19q was seen in 17 23 74 well-differentiated
  oligodendrogliomas, in 18 23 83 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and in 3 8 38 oligoastrocytomas
  grades II and III. LOH for 17p and or mutations of the TP53 gene occurred in 14
  of these 55 tumors. Only one of the 14 cases with 17p LOH TP53 gene mutation also
  had LOH for 1p and 19q, and significant astrocytic elements were seen histologically
  in the majority of these 14 tumors. LOH for 9p and or deletion of the CDKN2A gene
  occurred in 15 of these 55 tumors, and 11 of these cases were among the 24 42 anaplastic
  oligodendrogliomas. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH identified the majority
  of cases with 1p and 19q loss and, in addition, showed frequent loss of chromosomes
  4, 14, 15, and 18. These findings demonstrate that oligodendroglial neoplasms usually
  have loss of 1p and 19q whereas astrocytomas of the progressive type frequently
  contain mutations of the TP53 gene, and that 9p loss and CDKN2A deletions are associated
  with progression from well-differentiated to anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.
