abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was applied for a comprehensive screening
  of under- and overrepresentation of genetic material in 13 autoptic small cell lung
  cancer specimens. The most abundant genetic changes include DNA losses of chromosome
  arms 3p, 5q, 10q, 13q, and 17p and DNA gains of 3q, 5p, 8q, and 17q. Amplification
  sites in these tumors were mapped to 22 chromosome bands. The most frequently involved
  band was 19q13.1 4 cases . Bands 1p32, 2p23, 7q11.2, 8q24, and 13q33-34 were involved
  in two cases each.
