abstract: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, accounting for
  over 20 of cancers in children under 15 years of age. Pilocytic astrocytomas PAs
  , World Health Organization grade I, are one of the most frequently occurring childhood
  brain tumors, yet little is known about genetic changes characterizing this entity.
  We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization at 0.97 Mb resolution
  to study a series of PAs n 44 . No copy number abnormality was seen in 64 of cases
  at this resolution. However, whole chromosomal gain median 5 chromosomes affected
  occurred in 32 of tumors. The most frequently affected chromosomes were 5 and 7
  11 of 44 cases each followed by 6, 11, 15, and 20 greater than 10 of cases each
  . Findings were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and microsatellite
  analysis in a subset of tumors. Chromosomal gain was significantly more frequent
  in PAs from patients over 15 years old p 0.03, Fisher exact test . The number of
  chromosomes involved was also significantly greater in the older group p 0.02, Mann-Whitney
  U test . One case 2 showed a region of gain on chromosome 3 and one 2 a deletion
  on 6q as their sole abnormalities. This is the first genomewide study to show this
  nonrandom pattern of genetic alteration in pilocytic astrocytomas.
