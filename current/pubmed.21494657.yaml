abstract: Cancer genomes frequently contain somatic copy number alterations SCNA that
  can significantly perturb the expression level of affected genes and thus disrupt
  pathways controlling normal growth. In melanoma, many studies have focussed on the
  copy number and gene expression levels of the BRAF, PTEN and MITF genes, but little
  has been done to identify new genes using these parameters at the genome-wide scale.
  Using karyotyping, SNP and CGH arrays, and RNA-seq, we have identified SCNA affecting
  gene expression SCNA-genes in seven human metastatic melanoma cell lines. We showed
  that the combination of these techniques is useful to identify candidate genes potentially
  involved in tumorigenesis. Since few of these alterations were recurrent across
  our samples, we used a protein network-guided approach to determine whether any
  pathways were enriched in SCNA-genes in one or more samples. From this unbiased
  genome-wide analysis, we identified 28 significantly enriched pathway modules. Comparison
  with two large, independent melanoma SCNA datasets showed less than 10 overlap at
  the individual gene level, but network-guided analysis revealed 66 shared pathways,
  including all but three of the pathways identified in our data. Frequently altered
  pathways included WNT, cadherin signalling, angiogenesis and melanogenesis. Additionally,
  our results emphasize the potential of the EPHA3 and FRS2 gene products, involved
  in angiogenesis and migration, as possible therapeutic targets in melanoma. Our
  study demonstrates the utility of network-guided approaches, for both large and
  small datasets, to identify pathways recurrently perturbed in cancer.
