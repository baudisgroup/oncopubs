abstract: 'Risk assessment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC is currently
  based on clinicopathological parameters. To identify genomic markers that can predict
  overall survival in ESCC, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization array
  CGH on a screening set of 35 tumor samples from ESCC patients. Prognosis association
  of the genes selected on the basis of the array CGH results was further validated
  by real-time PCR in two independent sample sets n 151 and 84 . Genomic analysis
  revealed seven high-level amplifications and two homozygous deletions. Gain of 11q13.2
  and loss of 7q34 and 18q21.1-q23 were associated with poor outcome. Gain of 11q13.2
  was an independent prognostic factor and was selected for further validation. In
  both validation sets of samples, copy number increase of CPT1A in 11q13.2 was correlated
  with short overall survival P 0.015, n 151 and P 0.044, n 84 . Multivariate analysis
  confirmed that CPT1A gain provided prognostic information in ESCC HR, 1.643 95 CI:
  1.076-2.509 P 0.022 HR, 2.488 95 CI: 1.235-5.013 P 0.011 . Immunohistochemistry
  showed significant correlation between strong expression of CPT1A protein and poor
  outcome of ESCC patients P 0.018, n 73 . Our data suggest that gain of CPT1A may
  be a candidate prognostic factor.'
