abstract: Although 75 of endometrial cancers are treated at an early stage, 15 to
  20 of these recur. We performed an integrated analysis of genome-wide expression
  and copy-number data for primary endometrial carcinomas with extensive clinical
  and histopathological data to detect features predictive of recurrent disease. Unsupervised
  analysis of the expression data distinguished 2 major clusters with strikingly different
  phenotypes, including significant differences in disease-free survival. To identify
  possible mechanisms for these differences, we performed a global genomic survey
  of amplifications, deletions, and loss of heterozygosity, which identified 11 significantly
  amplified and 13 significantly deleted regions. Amplifications of 3q26.32 harboring
  the oncogene PIK3CA were associated with poor prognosis and segregated with the
  aggressive transcriptional cluster. Moreover, samples with PIK3CA amplification
  carried signatures associated with in vitro activation of PI3 kinase PI3K , a signature
  that was shared by aggressive tumors without PIK3CA amplification. Tumors with loss
  of PTEN expression or PIK3CA overexpression that did not have PIK3CA amplification
  also shared the PI3K activation signature, high protein expression of the PI3K pathway
  member STMN1, and an aggressive phenotype in test and validation datasets. However,
  mutations of PTEN or PIK3CA were not associated with the same expression profile
  or aggressive phenotype. STMN1 expression had independent prognostic value. The
  results affirm the utility of systematic characterization of the cancer genome in
  clinically annotated specimens and suggest the particular importance of the PI3K
  pathway in patients who have aggressive endometrial cancer.
