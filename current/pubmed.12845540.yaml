abstract: Glial tumors are the most common tumors of the nervous system, affecting
  individuals at any age. Since understanding of the molecular pathologies underlying
  human gliomas is still very poor, the treatment and therefore prognosis of this
  malignancy could not yet be improved. In order to determine whether different glioblastoma-associated
  genomic aberrations may serve as prognostic markers in combination with histopathological
  findings, 20 primary glioblastoma multiforme tumors were screened by comparative
  genomic hybridization, and the results were compared with histopathological and
  clinical features. All tumors showed genomic copy aberrations detected by comparative
  genomic hybridization. Regional and numerical increases in chromosome 7 copy number
  were the most frequently seen abnormality 10 20 tumors , followed by loss of chromosome
  10 8 20 . Both of these aberrations were associated with shorter surveillance time.
  Chromosome 12q amplification was detected in seven tumors. Loss of 17p, 1p, and
  19q in combination was seen in three cases. One of them was a giant cell GBM, whereas
  the remaining two cases were still alive. Combination of chromosome 1p and 19q deletions
  was also seen in a case with long surveillance. According to the preliminary findings
  of this study, in addition to the EGFR gene, amplification of other genes on chromosome
  7 and the deletion of PTEN gene and other cancer-related genes on chromosome 10
  appeared important to the development of glioblastoma multiforme and were associated
  with poor prognosis, whereas the combination of chromosome 1p and 19q deletions
  seems to be an informative molecular marker for better prognosis. The clinical features
  and genetic alterations of primary and secondary glioblastoma multiforme should
  be compared in large series to clarify the effective prognostic markers and further
  molecular analyses focused on chromosomes 7 and 10 will be very helpful for understanding
  the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of glioblastoma.
