abstract: Global studies of transcript structure and abundance in cancer cells enable
  the systematic discovery of aberrations that contribute to carcinogenesis, including
  gene fusions, alternative splice isoforms, and somatic mutations. We developed a
  systematic approach to characterize the spectrum of cancer-associated mRNA alterations
  through integration of transcriptomic and structural genomic data, and we applied
  this approach to generate new insights into melanoma biology. Using paired-end massively
  parallel sequencing of cDNA RNA-seq together with analyses of high-resolution chromosomal
  copy number data, we identified 11 novel melanoma gene fusions produced by underlying
  genomic rearrangements, as well as 12 novel readthrough transcripts. We mapped these
  chimeric transcripts to base-pair resolution and traced them to their genomic origins
  using matched chromosomal copy number information. We also used these data to discover
  and validate base-pair mutations that accumulated in these melanomas, revealing
  a surprisingly high rate of somatic mutation and lending support to the notion that
  point mutations constitute the major driver of melanoma progression. Taken together,
  these results may indicate new avenues for target discovery in melanoma, while also
  providing a template for large-scale transcriptome studies across many tumor types.
