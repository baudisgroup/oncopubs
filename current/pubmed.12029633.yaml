abstract: We carried out molecular cytogenetic characterization of 11 cell lines derived
  from hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs and 51 primary HCCs. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH revealed frequent amplification at 13q34, where we had detected amplification
  in several other types of tumor, including esophageal squamous cell carcinomas ESC
  . Previously, we suggested possible involvement of TFDP1, encoding a transcription
  factor DP-1, in the 13q34 amplification observed in a primary ESC. Therefore, we
  investigated amplifications and expression levels of 5 genes mapped on the amplified
  region, including TFDP1, for exploring amplification targets at 13q34 in HCCs. 3
  of those genes, TFDP1, CUL4A cullin 4A , and CDC16 cell division cycle 16 , showed
  distinct amplification and consequent over-expression in some cell lines. Moreover,
  each was amplified in 3 or 4 of the 51 primary HCCs, and all 3 were amplified in
  2 tumors, in which their expression patterns correlated with amplification patterns.
  To elucidate the functional role of TFDP1 in HCC, we examined expression levels
  of genes downstream of TFDP1 with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  PCR . Expression of cyclin E gene CCNE1 correlated closely with that of TFDP1 in
  not only cell lines, but also primary tumors. Treatment of HCC cells with the antisense
  oligonucleotide targeting TFDP1 resulted in down-regulation of CCNE1, suggesting
  that TFDP1 overexpression led to up-regulation of CCNE1 that encoded a positive
  regulator for cell cycle G1 S transition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that
  TFDP1, CUL4A, and CDC16 are probable targets of an amplification mechanism and therefore
  may be involved, together or separately, in development and or progression of some
  HCCs.
