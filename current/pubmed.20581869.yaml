abstract: Resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer is poorly understood. Evolutionary
  models of cancer predict that, following treatment, resistance emerges either because
  of outgrowth of an intrinsically resistant sub-clone or evolves in residual disease
  under the selective pressure of treatment. To investigate genetic evolution in high-grade
  serous HGS ovarian cancers, we first analysed cell line series derived from three
  cases of HGS carcinoma before and after platinum resistance had developed PEO1,
  PEO4 and PEO6 PEA1 and PEA2 and PEO14 and PEO23 . Analysis with 24-colour fluorescence
  in situ hybridisation and single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array comparative genomic
  hybridisation CGH showed mutually exclusive endoreduplication and loss of heterozygosity
  events in clones present at different time points in the same individual. This implies
  that platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease was not linearly related, but shared
  a common ancestor at an early stage of tumour development. Array CGH analysis of
  six paired pre- and post-neoadjuvant treatment HGS samples from the CTCR-OV01 clinical
  study did not show extensive copy number differences, suggesting that one clone
  was strongly dominant at presentation. These data show that cisplatin resistance
  in HGS carcinoma develops from pre-existing minor clones but that enrichment for
  these clones is not apparent during short-term chemotherapy treatment.
