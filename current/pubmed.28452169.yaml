abstract: A 70-year-old woman was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma of the occipital
  skin which was resected; however, multiple lung metastases were detected. Nivolumab
  therapy was initiated and partial response was obtained. However, the patient was
  diagnosed with grade 2 interstitial pneumonitis. Prednisolone administration was
  initiated and the interstitial pneumonitis shadow disappeared. However, then a right
  rib metastasis was noticed and given radiation therapy. After progressive disease
  was obtained, the metastatic lesion was resected, and no relapse occurred until
  skeletal muscle metastasis was found. According to whole-exome sequencing and gene
  expression profiling, the rib and skeletal muscle metastatic lesions showed an upregulated
  expression of programmed death-ligand 1 mRNA and a high single-nucleotide variant
  (SNV) number. The current melanoma case is representative of a patient who responded
  to nivolumab therapy, and showed typical immunological markers for responders such
  as high PD-L1 expression and high SNV.
