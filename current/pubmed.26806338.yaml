abstract: Ampullary carcinomas are highly malignant neoplasms that can have either
  intestinal or pancreatobiliary differentiation. To characterize somatic alterations
  in ampullary carcinomas, we performed whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy-number
  analysis on 60 ampullary carcinomas resected from clinically well-characterized
  Japanese and American patients. We next selected 92 genes and performed targeted
  sequencing to validate significantly mutated genes in an additional 112 cancers.
  The prevalence of driver gene mutations in carcinomas with the intestinal phenotype
  is different from those with the pancreatobiliary phenotype. We identified a characteristic
  significantly mutated driver gene (ELF3) as well as previously known driver genes
  (TP53, KRAS, APC, and others). Functional studies demonstrated that ELF3 silencing
  in normal human epithelial cells enhances their motility and invasion.  Copyright
