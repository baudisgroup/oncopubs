abstract: Neuroblastoma NB is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors and displays
  a broad variety of genomic alterations. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  A-CGH is a novel technology enabling the high-resolution detection of DNA copy number
  aberrations. In this article, we outline features of this new technology and approaches
  of data analysis. We focus on stage specific DNA copy number variations in neuroblastoma
  detected by cDNA array-based comparative genomic hybridization A-CGH . We also discuss
  hypothetic evolutionary models of neuroblastoma progression that can be derived
  from A-CGH data.
