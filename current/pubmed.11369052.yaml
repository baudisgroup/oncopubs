abstract: 'Well-differentiated liposarcomas WDLPS , especially those located in the
  retroperitoneum, may occasionally undergo dedifferentiation. Although this process
  is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, dedifferentiated liposarcomas
  rarely produces metastases. The case reported here is rather uncommon: A retroperitoneal
  WDLPS gave lung metastases that were diagnosed as highly malignant osteosarcomas.
  We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH , fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH , and Southern blot analyses to characterize the copy number changes and genetic
  aberrations occurring at different stages of the disease. In the primary tumor,
  the only detectable aberration was amplification of 12q13-q14, which was present
  only in a fraction of the cells and revealed by FISH analysis. High-level amplification
  of 12q13-q14, involving CDK4, MDM2, and HMGIC, was seen both in the relapse and
  the metastases. The second most common change, gain or high-level amplification
  of 1q22-q24, was detectable by CGH only in the osteogenic metastases, as was loss
  of the distal 2q. FISH analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity in the samples,
  and the percentage of cells showing aberrations was significantly higher in the
  metastatic samples. In particular, increased copy numbers of 789f2, a marker for
  1q21 amplification in sarcomas, was observed in more than 65 of the cells in the
  metastatic samples, but in less than 10 of the cells from the recurrent samples.
  These observations could indicate that 1q amplification, in particular, may be indicative
  of a more malignant phenotype and ability of metastasis in WDLPS, as has also been
  suggested by others.'
