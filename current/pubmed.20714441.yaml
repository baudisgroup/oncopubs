abstract: Our previous studies revealed that pregnancy associated breast cancer PABC
  had significantly reduced nuclear p63 expression in myoepithelia, while intense
  cytoplasmic p63 expression in associated epithelia. Our current study assessed these
  epithelia using immunohistochemistry with a panel of aggressiveness and invasiveness
  related markers and comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH with over 30,000
  DNA probes. These epithelia showed several unique alterations, including 1 immunohistochemical
  and morphological resemblance to invasive cancer, 2 significant gain in copy numbers
  of DNA coding genes for morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and 3 significant
  loss in copy numbers of DNA coding genes for tumor suppressors, cell adhesion, and
  macromolecular complex assembly or intra-cellular trafficking. Detected array-CGH
  alterations correlated well with in vivo expression of a number of corresponding
  proteins tested. These findings suggest that aberrant sub-cellular localization
  of p63 expression in normal or hyperplastic appearing epithelial cells may significant
  contribute to increased invasiveness and aggressiveness of these cells.
