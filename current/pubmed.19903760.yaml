abstract: 'Cancer progression in humans is difficult to infer because we do not routinely
  sample patients at multiple stages of their disease. However, heterogeneous breast
  tumors provide a unique opportunity to study human tumor progression because they
  still contain evidence of early and intermediate subpopulations in the form of the
  phylogenetic relationships. We have developed a method we call Sector-Ploidy-Profiling
  SPP to study the clonal composition of breast tumors. SPP involves macro-dissecting
  tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and profiling genomes
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Breast carcinomas display two classes
  of genomic structural variation: 1 monogenomic and 2 polygenomic. Monogenomic tumors
  appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with a highly stable chromosome
  structure. Polygenomic tumors contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which
  may occupy the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors,
  we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal subpopulations, rather
  than a series of gradual intermediates. By comparing multiple subpopulations from
  different anatomic locations, we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and
  the organization of tumor growth.'
