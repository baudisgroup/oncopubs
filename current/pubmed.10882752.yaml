abstract: The pathological entity of primitive neuroectodermal tumour medulloblastoma
  PNET MB comprises a very heterogeneous group of neoplasms on a clinical as well
  as on a molecular level. We evaluated the importance of DNA amplification in medulloblastomas
  and other primitive neuroectodermal tumours PNETs of the CNS.
