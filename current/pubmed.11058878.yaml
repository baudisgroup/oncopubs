abstract: Detailed knowledge of chromosomal aberrations in a specific tumor may facilitate
  the development of individually tailored chemotherapy, hormone or gene therapy.
  Unfortunately, karyotype analysis requires living cells and is complicated by the
  low number of good metaphase spreads obtained. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , however, is capable of detecting and mapping genome-wide amplifications and
  deletions using an equimolar mixture of normal and tumor cell DNA. We show here
  that even the few cells from a fine needle aspirate of a tumor are sufficient for
  a direct CGH assay, independent of DNA amplification. Ten primary breast cancers
  were analyzed by CGH. A fresh frozen fine needle aspirate and a formalin-fixed and
  paraffin-embedded section were used for each tumor. Metaphases from each CGH reaction
  were imaged, and a sum ratio profile was determined for every chromosome. The ratio
  profiles of DNA isolated from the 2 material sources were then compared. Fine needle
  aspirates and the paraffin-embedded material of a single tumor yielded the same
  fluorescence ratio profiles, albeit with slightly different confidence intervals.
  Different tumors showed a variety of aberrations. The most frequently observed changes
  were 1q , 8q , 14q-, 16p , 16q-, 17p-, 17q , 19q , 20q , 21q- and 22q-. The ability
  of CGH to assess chromosomal changes in breast cancer from fine needle aspirates
  could facilitate genetic evaluation of tumors prior to surgery.
