abstract: The MA11 cell line was established from malignant cells isolated from the
  bone marrow of a breast cancer patient. It metastasizes selectively to the brain
  in athymic mice. Since the genomic rearrangements of only a few breast cancer cell
  lines have been characterized completely, we analyzed MA11 cytogenetically. Because
  the G-banding analysis revealed a very complex karyotype with several markers and
  chromosomes with additional material of unknown origin, we used multicolor fluorescence
  in situ hybridization M-FISH , cross-species color banding RxFISH , comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , and chromosome-specific probes to better characterize
  the chromosome abnormalities. The use of these FISH-based screening techniques allowed
  us to detect previously unsuspected chromosomal changes and determine the identity
  of chromosomal markers. Multicolor FISH was especially useful to identify the rearranged
  chromosomes, whereas RxFISH, G-banding, and CGH were instrumental in determining
  breakpoint positions, although some uncertainties were removed only after hybridization
  with chromosome-specific probes. The combined analysis revealed a near-triploid
  karyotype with no less than 20 chromosomes demonstrating structural rearrangements.
  The resulting imbalances included several of those known to be common in primary
  breast carcinomas gain of 1q, 8q, and 20q and loss of 8p, 11q, and 13q , indicating
  that the MA11 cell line may serve as a good model to study breast carcinogenesis.
  The full cytogenetic characterization we present may guide future searches for the
  mechanism of organ-selective metastasis in this model system and, possibly, also
  in vivo.
