abstract: Most high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients benefit from first-line
  platinum-based chemotherapy, but progressively develop resistance during subsequent
  lines. Re-activating BRCA1 or MDR1 mutations can underlie platinum resistance in
  end-stage patients. However, little is known about resistance mechanisms occurring
  after a single line of platinum, when patients still qualify for other treatments.  In
  31 patients with primary platinum-sensitive HGSOC, we profiled tumours collected
  during debulking surgery before and after first-line chemotherapy using whole-exome
  sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism profiling.  Besides germline BRCA1/2
  mutations, we observed frequent loss-of-heterozygosity in homologous recombination
  (HR) genes and mutation spectra characteristic of HR-deficiency in all tumours.
  At relapse, tumours differed considerably from their primary counterparts. There
  was, however, no evidence of events reactivating the HR pathway, also not in tumours
  resistant to second-line platinum. Instead, a platinum score of 13 copy number regions,
  among other genes including MECOM, CCNE1 and ERBB2, correlated with platinum-free
  interval (PFI) after first-line therapy, whereas an increase of this score in recurrent
  tumours predicted the change in PFI during subsequent therapy.  Already after a
  single line of platinum, there is huge variability between primary and recurrent
  tumours, advocating that in HGSOC biopsies need to be collected at relapse to tailor
  treatment options to the underlying genetic profile. Nevertheless, all primary platinum-sensitive
  HGSOCs remained HR-deficient, irrespective of whether they became resistant to second-line
  platinum, further suggesting these tumours qualify for second-line Poly APD ribose
  polymerase (PARP) inhibitor treatment. Finally, chromosomal instability contributes
  to acquired resistance after a single line of platinum therapy.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015
