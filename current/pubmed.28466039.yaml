abstract: Cervical carcinoma is the second most common malignancy among women in both
  incidence and mortality. Although much is known about the etiology and treatment
  of cervical cancer, the role of genetic alterations in the multistep pathway of
  cervical tumorigenesis is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize
  the genomic changes in the cervical pre-cancerous lesions and tumors, induced by
  different types of human papillomaviruses. In this research was used the BlueGnome
  CytoChip oligo 2ï¿½× 105ï¿½K microarray for whole-genome oligo-array CGH. Microarray
  CGH analysis of 40 specimens was carried out-12 specimens from patients with early-stage
  squamous cell carcinomas; 19 specimens from patients with mild to moderate dysplasia
  and 9 with severe dysplasia. First we performed microarray CGH analysis of five
  DNA pools which contained the DNA from homogeneous groups of patients. The results
  revealed presence of micro chromosomal aberrations in chromosome region 14q11.2.
  According to the genome database these aberrations represent polymorphisms. Microarray
  analysis of DNA from 9 separate carcinoma lesions revealed a total of 26 aberrations
  in 14 chromosomes of nine patients. Our results showed the advantages of high-resolution
  chips in the clinical diagnosis of patients with cancerous and precancerous lesions
  caused by viral infection with HPV, but also highlight the need for extensive population
  studies revealing the molecular nature and clinical significance of different CNVs
  and the creation of detailed maps of variations in the Bulgarian population. This
  would facilitate extremely precise interpretation of specific genomic imbalances
  in the clinical aspect.
