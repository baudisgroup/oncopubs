abstract: Human papillomaviruses HPV are associated with a subset of head and neck
  squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC , particularly HPV16. This study analyzed the presence
  and genotype of high risk HPVs, viral DNA load and transcription of the E6 E7 mRNAs,
  in 231 consecutive HNSCC. Twelve out of 30 HPV16 DNA-positive tumors displayed high
  E6 E7 mRNAs levels and were localized in the oropharyngeal region. While HPV-free
  and non-transcriptionally active HPV-related patients showed similar 5-years survival
  rates, E6 E7 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This emphasizes
  the importance of considering the transcriptional status of HPV-positive tumors
  for patient stratification. A gene expression profiling analysis of these different
  types of tumors was carried out. The most significant differentially expressed gene
  was CDKN2A, a known biomarker for HPV-related cancer. Assessing both the expression
  level of the E6 E7 mRNAs and of CDKN2A in HNSCC is required to detect active HPV
  infection. Chromosomic alterations were investigated by Comparative Genomic Hybridation
  CGH analysis of tumors with transcriptionally active HPV and HPV-negative tumors.
  The loss of the chromosomal region 16q was found to be a major genetic event in
  HPV-positive lesions. A cluster of genes located in 16q21-24 displayed decreased
  expression levels, notably APP-BP1 that is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional
  activity of p53. In conclusion, this study highlights important criteria required
  to predict clinically active HPV infection, identifies new biological pathways implicated
  in HPV tumorigenesis and increases the understanding of HPV-HNSCC physiopathology
  that is required to develop new targets for therapy.
