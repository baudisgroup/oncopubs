abstract: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma and represents the most common primary malignancy of the spleen. Its precise
  molecular pathogenesis is still unknown and specific molecular markers for diagnosis
  or possible targets for causal therapies are lacking.  We performed whole exome
  sequencing (WES) and copy number analysis from laser-microdissected tumor cells
  of two primary SMZL discovery cases. Selected somatic single nucleotide variants
  (SNVs) were analyzed using pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing in an independent
  validation cohort.  Overall, 25 nonsynonymous somatic SNVs were identified, including
  known mutations in the NOTCH2 and MYD88 genes. Twenty-three of the mutations have
  not been associated with SMZL before. Many of these seem to be subclonal. Screening
  of 24 additional SMZL for mutations at the same positions found mutated in the WES
  approach revealed no recurrence of mutations for ZNF608 and PDE10A, whereas the
  MYD88 L265P missense mutation was identified in 15% of cases. An analysis of the
  NOTCH2 PEST domain and the whole coding region of the transcription factor SMYD1
  in eight cases identified no additional case with a NOTCH2 mutation, but two additional
  cases with SMYD1 alterations.  In this first WES approach from microdissected SMZL
  tissue we confirmed known mutations and discovered new somatic variants. Recurrence
  of MYD88 mutations in SMZL was validated, but NOTCH2 PEST domain mutations were
  relatively rare (10 % of cases). Recurrent mutations in the transcription factor
  SMYD1 have not been described in SMZL before and warrant further investigation.
