abstract: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia T-PLL is a rare aggressive lymphoma derived
  from mature T cells, which is, in most cases, characterized by the presence of an
  inv 14 q11q32 t 14 14 q11 q32 and a characteristic pattern of secondary chromosomal
  aberrations. DNA microarray technology was employed to compare the transcriptomes
  of eight immunomagnetically purified CD3 normal donor-derived peripheral blood cell
  samples, with five highly purified inv 14 t 14 14 -positive T-PLL blood samples.
  Between the two experimental groups, 734 genes were identified as differentially
  expressed, including functionally important genes involved in lymphomagenesis, cell
  cycle regulation, apoptosis and DNA repair. Notably, the differentially expressed
  genes were found to be significantly enriched in genomic regions affected by recurrent
  chromosomal imbalances. Upregulated genes clustered on chromosome arms 6p and 8q,
  and downregulated genes on 6q, 8p, 10p, 11q and 18p. High-resolution copy-number
  determination using single nucleotide polymorphism chip technology in 12 inv 14
  t 14 14 -positive T-PLL including those analyzed for gene expression, refined chromosomal
  breakpoints as well as regions of imbalances. In conclusion, combined transcriptional
  and molecular cytogenetic profiling identified novel specific chromosomal loci and
  genes that are likely to be involved in disease progression and suggests a gene
  dosage effect as a pathogenic mechanism in T-PLL.
