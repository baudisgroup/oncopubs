abstract: Although astrocytomas are the most common central nervous system tumours
  in all age groups, there is substantial evidence that tumours arising in young patients
  amp lt 25 years of age do not have the same genetic abnormalities that are characteristic
  of tumours in older patients. Furthermore, novel, consistent changes have not been
  identified in astrocytomas in children and young adults. We analysed 13 malignant
  astrocytomas from young patients using comparative genomic hybridisation. Regions
  of genomic imbalance were identified in 10 cases. The most common recurrent copy
  number aberrations were loss of 16p 54 of cases , 17p 38 , 19p 38 , and 22 38 and
  gain on 2q 38 , 12q 38 , 13 38 , 4q 31 , 5q 31 , and 8q 31 . Seven regions of high
  copy number amplification were observed at 8q21-22 three cases , 7q22-23 two cases
  , and 1p21-22, 2q22, 12q13-pter, 12q15-21, and 13q11-14 one case each . This study
  provides evidence of new characteristic chromosomal imbalances from which potential
  candidate genes involved in the development of malignant astrocytoma in children
  and young adults may be identified.
