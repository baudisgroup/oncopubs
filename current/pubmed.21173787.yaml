abstract: To identify transcriptional profiles predictive of the clinical benefit
  of cisplatin and fluorouracil CF chemotherapy to gastric cancer patients, endoscopic
  biopsy samples from 96 CF-treated metastatic gastric cancer patients were prospectively
  collected before therapy and analyzed using high-throughput transcriptional profiling
  and array comparative genomic hybridization. Transcriptional profiling identified
  917 genes that are correlated with poor patient survival after CF at P amp lt 0.05
  poor prognosis signature , in which protein synthesis and DNA replication recombination
  repair functional categories are enriched. A survival risk predictor was then constructed
  using genes, which are included in the poor prognosis signature and are contained
  within identified genomic amplicons. The combined expression of three genes-MYC,
  EGFR and FGFR2-was an independent predictor for overall survival of 27 CF-treated
  patients in the validation set adjusted P 0.017 , and also for survival of 40 chemotherapy-treated
  gastric cancer patients in a published data set adjusted P 0.026 . Thus, combined
  expression of MYC, EGFR and FGFR2 is predictive of poor survival in CF-treated metastatic
  gastric cancer patients.
