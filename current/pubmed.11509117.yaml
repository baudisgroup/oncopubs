abstract: In a cytogenetic and comparative genomic hybridization CGH study of 38 hepatoblastomas,
  we found gain of 1q in 17 tumors 44.7 , that of 2 2q in 14 36.8 , that of 20 20q
  in 9 23.7 and that of 8 8q in 8 21.0 , loss of 4q in 4 10.5 and no DNA copy changes
  with normal karyotype or no mitotic cells in 11 28.9 . Eleven tumors with 2 2q gain
  detected by CGH had a total chromosome 2 gain, a partial 2q gain, or a total chromosome
  2 gain with an augmented partial 2q region the common region for DNA copy gain was
  2q24. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analyses using probes covering
  the centromere of chromosome 2 or HOXD13 2q31 confirmed the CGH findings, and showed
  that the common region for gain in 2q was centromeric to HOXD13. Event-free survival
  EFS - standard error SE at 5 years was lowest in patients with 2q gain 37 - 15 ,
  highest in those with no DNA copy changes 82 - 12 , and intermediate in those with
  DNA copy changes other than 2q gain 74 - 13 P 0.0549 . Multivariate analysis showed
  that 2q gain was an independent factor predicting a poor outcome. These findings
  suggest the presence of a growth-promoting gene or an oncogene in the 2q24 chromosome
  band, and a tumor suppressor gene in terminal 4q, which have important roles in
  the development and progression of hepatoblastoma.
