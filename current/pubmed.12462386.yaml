abstract: Mucinous cancers of the breast are distinguished histologically by their
  abundant pools of mucin and low degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Relative to the
  more common breast cancers of no distinctive type ductal carcinoma , mucinous cancers
  have a relatively favorable prognosis. In a study of chromosomal changes in mucinous
  cancers, we evaluated the extent of loss of heterozygosity LOH at chromosomal regions
  commonly deleted in usual infiltrating ductal carcinoma, including markers on chromosomal
  arms 1p, 1q, 3p, 6q, 8p, 9p, 11p, 11q, 13q, 16q, 17p, and 17q. Remarkably, we found
  an average frequency of LOH of only 1.9 of these 12 chromosomal arms in 18 cases
  of mucinous carcinoma, compared to an average frequency of LOH of 6.4 of these same
  chromosomal arms in cases of infiltrating ductal cancer. In three of the 18 cases
  of mucinous carcinoma studied, including one case with regional lymph node metastases,
  no LOH was seen at any of the 12 chromosomal regions studied. We considered the
  possibility of other chromosomal loci being more commonly affected in mucinous cancers
  and conducted comparative genomic hybridization on six of the cases. These studies
  demonstrated a low overall frequency of genomic copy number changes mean of 3.1
  changes per case and failed to reveal any other chromosomal locus with frequent
  losses that had not been evaluated by microsatellite analysis. Together, these data
  indicate that mucinous cancers of the breast do not have the extensive genomic alterations
  that are typically found in more common variants of breast cancer. Thus, mucinous
  cancers most likely have less genetic instability than most other forms of breast
  cancer and the molecular pathogenesis of this form of breast cancer is likely to
  be substantially different than that of usual ductal breast cancer.
