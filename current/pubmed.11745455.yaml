abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to screen for changes in
  the number of DNA sequence copies in 30 primary colorectal cancers and 16 liver
  metastases, to identify regions that contain genes important for the development
  and progression of colorectal cancer. In primary colorectal cancer, we found frequent
  gains at 7p21 36.7 , 7q31-36 30 , 8q23-24 43.0 , 12p 30 , 14q24-32 33.3 , 16p 40.0
  , 20p 33.3 , 20q 63.3 and 21q 36.3 , while loss was often noted at 18q12-23 36.7
  . In metastatic tumors, there were significantly more gains and losses of DNA sequences
  than in primary tumors, with gains at 8q23-24 found in 62.5 of recurrences vs. 43.0
  of primary tumors , 15q21-26 37.5 vs. 20.0 , 19p 43.8 vs. 20.0 and 20q 81.3 vs.
  63.3 and losses at 18q12-23 50.0 vs. 36.7 . The pattern of genetic changes seen
  in metastatic tumors, with frequent gains at 8q23-24 and 20q and loss at 18q12-23,
  suggests the progression of colorectal cancer. We investigated a clinical follow-up
  study for all patients examined by CGH and directed our attention to the genetic
  changes consisting of gains at 8q and 20q. The incidence of liver metastases was
  higher in patients with primary colorectal cancer with these genetic changes. Gains
  at 8q and 20q might be useful to identify patients at high risk for developing liver
  metastases.
