abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect copy number changes
  of DNA sequences in the Ewing family of tumours ET . We analysed 20 samples from
  17 patients. Fifteen tumours 75 showed copy number changes. Gains of DNA sequences
  were much more frequent than losses, the majority of the gains affecting whole chromosomes
  or whole chromosome arms. Recurrent findings included copy number increases for
  chromosomes 8 seven out of 20 samples 35 , 1q five samples 25 and 12 five samples
  25 . The minimal common regions of these gains were the whole chromosomes 8 and
  12, and 1q21-22. High-level amplifications affected 8q13-24, 1q and 1q21-22, each
  once. Southern blot analysis of the specimen with high-level amplification at 1q21-22
  showed an amplification of FLG and SPRR3, both mapped to this region. All cases
  with a gain of chromosome 12 simultaneously showed a gain of chromosome 8. Comparison
  of CGH findings with cytogenetic analysis of the same tumours and previous cytogenetic
  reports of ET showed, in general, concordant results. In conclusion, our findings
  confirm that secondary changes, which may have prognostic significance in ET, are
  trisomy 8, trisomy 12 and a gain of DNA sequences in 1q.
