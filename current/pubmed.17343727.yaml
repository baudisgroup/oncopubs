abstract: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization aCGH is a rapidly evolving technology
  that still lacks complete standardization. Yet, it is of great importance to obtain
  robust and reproducible data to enable meaningful multiple hybridization comparisons.
  Special difficulties arise when aCGH is performed on archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
  FFPE tissue due to its variable DNA quality. Recently, we have developed an effective
  DNA quality test that predicts suitability of archival samples for BAC aCGH.
