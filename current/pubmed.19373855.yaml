abstract: We report genetic aberrations that activate the ERK MAP kinase pathway in
  100 of posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytomas, with a high frequency of gene fusions
  between KIAA1549 and BRAF among these tumours. These fusions were identified from
  analysis of focal copy number gains at 7q34, detected using Affymetrix 250K and
  6.0 SNP arrays. PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of five KIAA1549-BRAF
  fusion variants, along with a single fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1. The resulting
  fusion genes lack the auto-inhibitory domains of BRAF and RAF1, which are replaced
  in-frame by the beginning of KIAA1549 and SRGAP3, respectively, conferring constitutive
  kinase activity. An activating mutation of KRAS was identified in the single pilocytic
  astrocytoma without a BRAF or RAF1 fusion. Further fusions and activating mutations
  in BRAF were identified in 28 of grade II astrocytomas, highlighting the importance
  of the ERK MAP kinase pathway in the development of paediatric low-grade gliomas.
