abstract: Women with contralateral breast cancer (CBC) have significantly worse prognosis
  compared to women with unilateral cancer. A possible explanation of the poor prognosis
  of patients with CBC is that in a subset of patients, the second cancer is not a
  new primary tumor but a metastasis of the first cancer that has potentially obtained
  aggressive characteristics through selection of treatment. Exome and whole-genome
  sequencing of solid tumors has previously been used to investigate the clonal relationship
  between primary tumors and metastases in several diseases. In order to assess the
  relationship between the first and the second cancer, we performed exome sequencing
  to identify somatic mutations in both first and second cancers, and compared paired
  normal tissue of 25 patients with metachronous CBC. For three patients, we identified
  shared somatic mutations indicating a common clonal origin thereby demonstrating
  that the second tumor is a metastasis of the first cancer, rather than a new primary
  cancer. Accordingly, these patients all developed distant metastasis within 3ï¿½years
  of the second diagnosis, compared with 7 out of 22 patients with non-shared somatic
  profiles. Genomic profiling of both tumors help the clinicians distinguish between
  true CBCs and subsequent metastases.
