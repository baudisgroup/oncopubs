abstract: Despite similarities between tumor-initiating cells with stem-like properties
  TICs and normal neural stem cells, we hypothesized that there may be differences
  in their differentiation potentials. We now demonstrate that both bone morphogenetic
  protein BMP -mediated and ciliary neurotrophic factor CNTF -mediated Jak STAT-dependent
  astroglial differentiation is impaired due to EZH2-dependent epigenetic silencing
  of BMP receptor 1B BMPR1B in a subset of glioblastoma TICs. Forced expression of
  BMPR1B either by transgene expression or demethylation of the promoter restores
  their differentiation capabilities and induces loss of their tumorigenicity. We
  propose that deregulation of the BMP developmental pathway in a subset of glioblastoma
  TICs contributes to their tumorigenicity both by desensitizing TICs to normal differentiation
  cues and by converting otherwise cytostatic signals to proproliferative signals.
