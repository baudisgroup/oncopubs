abstract: Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a soft tissue sarcoma with poor prognosis,
  and little molecular evidence exists for its origin, initiation, and progression.
  The aim of this study was to elucidate candidate molecular pathways involved in
  tumor pathogenesis.  We employed high-throughput array comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) and cDNA-Mediated Annealing, Selection, Ligation, and Extension Assay to
  profile the genomic and expression signatures of primary and metastatic ASPS from
  17 tumors derived from 11 patients. We used an integrative bioinformatics approach
  to elucidate the molecular pathways associated with ASPS progression. FISH was performed
  to validate the presence of the t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) ASPL-TFE3 fusion and, hence,
  confirm the aCGH observations.  FISH analysis identified the ASPL-TFE3 fusion in
  all cases. aCGH revealed a higher number of numerical aberrations in metastatic
  tumors relative to primaries, but failed to identify consistent alterations in either
  group. Gene expression analysis highlighted 1,063 genes that were differentially
  expressed between the two groups. Gene set enrichment analysis identified 16 enriched
  gene sets (P < 0.1) associated with differentially expressed genes. Notable among
  these were several stem cell gene expression signatures and pathways related to
  differentiation. In particular, the paired box transcription factor PAX6 was upregulated
  in the primary tumors, along with several genes whose mouse orthologs have previously
  been implicated in Pax6 DNA binding during neural stem cell differentiation.  In
  addition to suggesting a tentative neural line of differentiation for ASPS, these
  results implicate transcriptional deregulation from fusion genes in the pathogenesis
  of ASPS.  ï¿½2014 AACR.
