abstract: Small-cell prostate carcinoma (SCPC) morphology predicts for a distinct
  clinical behavior, resistance to androgen ablation, and frequent but short responses
  to chemotherapy. We sought to develop model systems that reflect human SCPC and
  can improve our understanding of its biology.We developed a set of castration-resistant
  prostate carcinomas xenografts and examined their fidelity to their human tumors
  of origin. We compared the expression and genomic profiles of SCPC and large-cell
  neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) xenografts to those of typical prostate adenocarcinoma
  xenografts. Results were validated immunohistochemically in a panel of 60 human
  tumors.The reported SCPC and LCNEC xenografts retain high fidelity to their human
  tumors of origin and are characterized by a marked upregulation of UBE2C and other
  mitotic genes in the absence of androgen receptor (AR), retinoblastoma (RB1), and
  cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression. We confirmed these findings in a panel of samples
  of CRPC patients. In addition, array comparative genomic hybridization of the xenografts
  showed that the SCPC/LCNEC tumors display more copy number variations than the adenocarcinoma
  counterparts. Amplification of the UBE2C locus and microdeletions of RB1 were present
  in a subset, but none displayed AR nor CCND1 deletions. The AR, RB1, and CCND1 promoters
  showed no CpG methylation in the SCPC xenografts.Modeling human prostate carcinoma
  with xenografts allows in-depth and detailed studies of its underlying biology.
  The detailed clinical annotation of the donor tumors enables associations of anticipated
  relevance to be made. Future studies in the xenografts will address the functional
  significance of the findings.
