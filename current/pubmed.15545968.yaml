abstract: Host genomic abnormalities may determine the natural history of cervical
  squamous intraepithelial lesions SILs . We undertook comparative genomic hybridisation
  analysis of epithelium carefully microdissected from 70 cervical SILs, the largest
  series to date. In contrast to previous studies, we used frozen sections for optimal
  DNA quality and examined whether patterns of DNA copy number imbalance CNI are characteristic
  of SIL grade, human papillomavirus HPV status and postoperative recurrence. We identified
  more CNIs in cervical SIL than previously described, with more CNIs per case in
  high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion HG-SIL than in low-grade squamous intraepithelial
  lesion LG-SIL P 0.04 . While some CNIs were seen at similar frequencies in HG-SIL
  and LG-SIL, others, including gain on 1q, 3q and 16q, were found frequently in HG-SIL
  but not in LG-SIL. There were significantly more CNIs per case in HG-SILs showing
  loss of the HPV16 E2 gene a repressor of viral oncogene transcription P 0.026 and
  in HG-SILs that subsequently recurred P 0.04 . Our data are consistent with sequential
  acquisition of CNIs in cervical SIL progression. Higher frequency of CNI in association
  with E2 gene loss supports in vitro evidence that high-risk HPV integration is associated
  with genomic instability. Further investigation of the clinical value of specific
  host genomic abnormalities in cervical SIL is warranted.
