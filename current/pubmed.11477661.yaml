abstract: The incidence of adenocarcinoma arising at the esophagogastric junction
  EGJ is increasing at a rate greater than that for any other form of solid malignancy.
  Commensurate with this, the incidence of histologically similar tumors arising in
  the gastric body and antral mucosa is declining. The increased incidence of the
  proximal group of tumors may reflect, in part, the higher prevalence of Barrett
  esophagus. These epidemiological features suggest that histologically similar tumors
  arising at the EGJ and from the distal stomach are different, which may be reflected
  in the genetic abnormalities that characterize the two groups of tumors. The purpose
  of this study was to screen genomic DNA from adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and
  stomach for regions of chromosomal imbalance, using comparative genomic hybridization
  to determine whether tumors at the EGJ junctional tumors have a different profile
  compared with tumors of the distal stomach. Tumor samples were derived from a series
  of 48 gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas 20 junctional and 28 distal that were acquired
  prospectively from patients undergoing esophagogastrectomy. These tumors are characterized
  by several regions of chromosomal imbalance with no obvious correlation between
  most regions of abnormal copy number and tumor type. However, our study shows for
  the first time cytogenetic abnormalities 5p and 18q- that identify statistically
  significant differences P amp lt 0.02 and amp lt 0.05, respectively between junctional
  and distal gastric tumors. These differences are gain of 5p 55 11 20 of junctional
  tumors vs. 21 6 28 of distal gastric tumors and loss of 18q 25 5 20 cases of junctional
  tumors vs. 4 1 28 of distal tumors segregating with tumors of the EGJ. These abnormalities
  may distinguish distinct tumor subtypes that are recognized in epidemiological and
  clinical studies but that are otherwise histologically identical.
