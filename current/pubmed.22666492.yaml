abstract: Current treatment of paediatric hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is often inefficient
  due to advanced disease at diagnosis and resistance to common drugs. The aim of
  this study was to generate a cell line derived from a paediatric HCC in order to
  expand research in this field. We established the HC-AFW1 cell line from a liver
  neoplasm of a 4-year-old boy through culturing of primary tumor specimens. The cell
  line has been stable for over one year of culturing and has a doubling time of 40
  h. The tumour cells have an epithelial histology and express HCC-associated proteins
  such as Alpha-fetoprotein AFP , Glypican 3, E-cadherin, CD10, CD326, HepPar1 and
  Vimentin. Forty-nine amino acids in exon 3 of beta-Catenin that involve the phosphorylation
  sites of GSK3 were absent and beta-Catenin is detectable in the cell nuclei. Cytogenetic
  analysis revealed large anomalies in the chromosomal map. Several alterations of
  gene copy numbers were detected by genome-wide SNP array. Among the different drugs
  tested, cisplatin and irinotecan showed effective inhibition of tumour cell growth
  in a proliferation assay at concentrations below 5 microg ml. Subcutaneous xenotransplantation
  of HC-AFW1 cells into NOD SCID mice resulted in fast growing dedifferentiated tumours
  with high levels of serum AFP. Histological analyses of the primary tumour and xenografts
  included national and international expert pathological review. Consensus reading
  characterised the primary tumour and the HC-AFW1-derived tumours as HCC. HC-AFW1
  is the first cell line derived from a paediatric HCC without a background of viral
  hepatitis or cirrhosis and represents a valuable tool for investigating the biology
  of and therapeutic strategies for childhood HCC.
