abstract: To further characterise the genetic background of the two closely related
  B-lymphocytic malignancies hairy cell leukaemia HCL , and splenic marginal zone
  lymphoma SMZL we have identified characteristic copy number imbalances by comparative
  genomic hybridisation CGH . Based on these findings, areas of special interest were
  fine mapped, and relevant probes constructed for use in interphase-fluorescence
  in situ hybridisation FISH investigations. Thus, using the CGH data from 52 HCL
  and 61 SMZL patients, we identified the characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances
  for both diseases. These were a gain of 5q13-31 19 and loss of 7q22-q35 6 for HCL,
  and gain of 3q25 28 , loss of 7q31 16 , and gain of 12q15 16 for SMZL. A partial
  loss of 7q unusual for low-malignant B-cell diseases was found to be common to the
  two diseases. This loss was therefore fine mapped with BAC PAC clones. Fine mapping
  revealed that in SMZL the minimal lost region covers 11.4 Mb spanning from 7q31.33
  to 7q33 located between sequence tagged site STS -markers SHGC-3275 and D7S725.
  This area was distinct from the commonly deleted 7q region of myelodysplastic syndrome
  acute myeloid leukaemia MDS AML . A FISH probe specific for the 7q region was constructed.
  Using this probe in an interphase-FISH investigation we showed the minimal lost
  7q-region of HCL and SMZL to be one and the same. In one HCL case, this investigation
  furthermore showed the extent of the deleted region to be below the detection limit
  of CGH, whereas interphase-FISH screening of 36 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL
  cases showed no deletion of the 7q area. In conclusion, we have identified characteristic
  profiles of copy number imbalances in HCL and SMZL and fine mapped the minimal extent
  of a commonly lost 7q area of special interest. We hypothesise that this region
  may contain a gene s important for the pathology of HCL and SMZL.
