abstract: 'In this study, we examined nine cases of advanced Japanese prostate cancer
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH to detect chromosomal imbalances across
  the entire genome and to identify several new regions likely to contain genes important
  to the development and progression of this disease. These cases had been previously
  examined for numerical chromosomal aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH . By CGH, the following regions were found to be over-represented gains , with
  fluorescence ratio values higher than the threshold: 4p, 6p, 8q, 11q, 12q, 15q,
  16p, 17q, 20, and 21 amp gt 4 cases underrepresentation losses involved: 1q, 4q,
  5q, 6q, 13q, 14q, and 22 amp gt 4 cases . The shortest regions of overlap SRO of
  gains were noted at 8q24.1 through q24.3, 12q23, and 17q23 through q24 amp gt 5
  cases . The SRO of losses were seen at 5q14 through q21, 6q16.1 through q21, 13q21.3
  through q22, and 14q21 amp gt 5 cases . Notably, the gain of chromosomes 8 and 12
  by CGH was in agreement with the FISH data, suggesting that the gain of chromosomes
  8 and 12 may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. The genes on the
  SRO regions were also discussed in relation to oncogenes and bone metastases.'
