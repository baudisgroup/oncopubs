abstract: ' Microglandular adenosis MGA is a proliferative breast lesion, which has
  been proposed to be a potential precursor of triple-negative breast cancers. The
  aims of this study were to determine whether MGAs harbour genetic alterations and
  if any such genetic aberrations found in MGAs are similar to those found in matched
  invasive carcinomas.'
