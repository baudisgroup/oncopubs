abstract: Ewing sarcoma family tumors are aggressive sarcomas of childhood and adolescence
  with continuing poor outcomes. Decades of research on the characteristics of the
  often solitary-known oncogenic-genomic aberration in Ewing sarcoma family tumors,
  namely a TET-ETS fusion, have provided little advancement in the understanding of
  the molecular pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma or treatment thereof. In this study,
  the high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism technology was used to identify
  additional secondary copy-number alterations CNAs in Ewing sarcoma that might elucidate
  the aggressive biology of this sarcoma. We compared paired constitutional and tumor
  DNA samples. Commonly known genomic alterations including gain of 1q and chromosome
  8 were the most frequently detected changes in this study. In addition, deletions
  and loss of heterozygosity were identified in 10q, 11p, and 17p. Furthermore, tumor-specific
  CNAs were identified not only in genes previously known to be of interest, including
  CDKN2A, but also in genes not previously associated with Ewing sarcoma, including
  SOX6 and PTEN. Selected array-based findings were confirmed by fluorescence in situ
  hybridization, immunohistochemical studies, or sequencing. The results highlight
  an unexpected level of cytogenetic complexity associated with several of the samples,
  2 of which contained TP53 mutations. In summary, our high-resolution genome-wide
  copy-number data identify several novel CNAs associated with Ewing sarcoma, which
  are promising targets for novel therapeutic strategies in this aggressive sarcoma.
