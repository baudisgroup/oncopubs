abstract: Rectal cancer response to chemoradiation CRT varies from no response to
  a pathologic complete response pCR . Identifying predictive biomarkers of response
  would therefore be useful. We assessed whether chromosomal copy number alterations
  CNAs can assist in predicting pCR. Pretreatment tumor biopsies and paired normal
  surgical tissues from the proximal resection margin were collected from 95 rectal
  cancer patients treated with preoperative CRT and total mesorectal excision in a
  prospective Phase II study. Tumor and control DNA were extracted, and oligonucleotide
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was used to identify CNAs, which
  were correlated with pCR. Ingenuity pathway analysis IPA was then used to identify
  functionally relevant genes in aberrant regions. Finally, a predictive model for
  pCR was built using support vector machine SVM , and leave-one-out cross validation
  assessed the accuracy of aCGH. Chromosomal regions most commonly affected by gains
  were 20q11.21-q13.33, 13q11.32-23, 7p22.3-p22.2, and 8q23.3-q24.3, and losses were
  present at 18q11.32-q23, 17p13.3-q11.1, 10q23.1, and 4q32.1-q32.3. The 25 26 patients
  who achieved a pCR had significantly fewer high copy gains overall than non-pCR
  patients P 0.01 . Loss of chromosomal region 15q11.1-q26.3 was significantly associated
  with non-pCR P amp lt 0.00002 Q-bound amp lt 0.0391 , while loss of 12p13.31 was
  significantly associated with pCR P amp lt 0.0003 Q-bound amp lt 0.097 . IPA identified
  eight genes in the imbalanced chromosomal regions that associated with tumor response.
  SVM identified 58 probes that predict pCR with 76 sensitivity, 97 specificity, and
  positive and negative predictive values of 91 and 92 . Our data indicate that chromosomal
  CNAs can help identify rectal cancer patients more likely to develop a pCR to CRT.
