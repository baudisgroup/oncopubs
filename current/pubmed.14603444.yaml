abstract: We recently demonstrated that the prognosis for de novo CD5-positive CD5
  diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma DLBCL is markedly worse than that for CD5-negative
  CD5- DLBCL. Our findings also suggested that on the basis of its clinical features
  CD5 DLBCL may constitute a unique disease category. However, the genetic basis for
  these two categories has not been established. Therefore, we performed comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis CGH of 26 cases of CD5 DLBCL and 44 cases of CD5-
  DLBCL. Several identical changes in CD5 and CD5- DLBCLs were found, such as gains
  of 3q, 9p, 12q, 13q, and 18q and losses of 1p, 6q, 17p, and 19p. However, distinct
  differences between the two categories were also detected. These included gains
  of 11q21-q24 P 0.032 and 16p P 0.005 in CD5 DLBCL, and loss of 16p P 0.028 in CD5-
  DLBCL. A comparison with results reported for mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia, and Richters syndrome demonstrated that the CGH pattern of CD5 DLBCL was
  markedly different. This indicates that CD5 DLBCL constitutes a disease category
  distinct from that of CD5- DLBCL and other CD5 malignancies.
