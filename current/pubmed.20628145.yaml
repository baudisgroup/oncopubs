abstract: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL)
  are lymphoid malignancies with certain shared clinical, histologic, and molecular
  features. Primary cHLs and MLBCLs include variable numbers of malignant cells within
  an inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting that these tumors escape immune surveillance.
  Herein, we integrate high-resolution copy number data with transcriptional profiles
  and identify the immunoregulatory genes, PD-L1 and PD-L2, as key targets at the
  9p24.1 amplification peak in HL and MLBCL cell lines. We extend these findings to
  laser-capture microdissected primary Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells and primary MLBCLs
  and find that programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) ligand/9p24.1 amplification is restricted
  to nodular sclerosing HL, the cHL subtype most closely related to MLBCL. Using quantitative
  immunohistochemical methods, we document the association between 9p24.1 copy number
  and PD-1 ligand expression in primary tumors. In cHL and MLBCL, the extended 9p24.1
  amplification region also included the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) locus. Of note, JAK2
  amplification increased protein expression and activity, specifically induced PD-1
  ligand transcription and enhanced sensitivity to JAK2 inhibition. Therefore, 9p24.1
  amplification is a disease-specific structural alteration that increases both the
  gene dosage of PD-1 ligands and their induction by JAK2, defining the PD-1 pathway
  and JAK2 as complementary rational therapeutic targets.
