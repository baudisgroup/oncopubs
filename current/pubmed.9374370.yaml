abstract: Squamous cell carcinomas of the anus are rare neoplasias that account for
  about 3 of large bowel tumours. Infections with human papillomaviruses are frequently
  detected in these cancers, suggesting that pathogenic pathways in anal carcinomas
  and in carcinomas of the uterine cervix are similar. Little is known regarding recurrent
  chromosomal aberrations in this subgroup of squamous cell carcinomas. We have applied
  comparative genomic hybridization to identify chromosomal gains and losses in 23
  cases of anal carcinomas. A non-random copy number increase of chromosomes 17 and
  19, and chromosome arm 3q was observed. Consistent losses were mapped to chromosome
  arms 4p, 11q, 13q and 18q. A majority of the tumours were aneuploid, and most of
  them showed increased proliferative activity as determined by staining for Ki-67
  antigen. p53 expression was low or undetectable, and expression of p21 WAF-1 was
  increased in most tumours. Sixteen cancers were satisfactorily tested for the presence
  of HPV by consensus L1-primer polymerase chain reaction nine were HPV positive,
  of which eight were positive for HPV 16.
