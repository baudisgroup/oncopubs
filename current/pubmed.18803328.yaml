abstract: Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL comprises genetically distinct
  subtypes. However, 25 of cases still lack defined genetic hallmarks. To identify
  genomic aberrancies in childhood ALL patients nonclassifiable by conventional methods,
  we performed a single nucleotide polymorphisms SNP array-based genomic analysis
  of leukemic cells from 29 cases. The vast majority of cases analyzed 19 24, 79 showed
  genomic abnormalities at least one of them affected either genes involved in cell
  cycle regulation or in B-cell development. The most relevant abnormalities were
  CDKN2A 9p21 deletions 7 24, 29 , ETV6 TEL 12p13 deletions 3 24, 12 , and intrachromosomal
  amplifications of chromosome 21 iAMP21 3 24, 12 . To identify variation in expression
  of genes directly or indirectly affected by recurrent genomic alterations, we integrated
  genomic and gene expression data generated by microarray analyses of the same samples.
  SMAD1 emerged as a down-regulated gene in CDKN2A homozygous deleted cases compared
  with nondeleted. The JAG1 gene, encoding the Jagged 1 ligand of the Notch receptor,
  was among a list of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in ETV6-deleted
  cases. Our findings demonstrate that integration of genomic analysis and gene expression
  profiling can identify genetic lesions undetected by routine methods and potential
  novel pathways involved in B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis.
