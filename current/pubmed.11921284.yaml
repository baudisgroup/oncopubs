abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was used to analyze 41 adult fibrosarcomas
  from 34 patients. Thirty-one patients showed in their tumors DNA sequence copy number
  changes mean 11, range 3-25 . The minimal common regions for the most frequent gains
  were narrowed down to 12q21 18 cases 12q14-q15 and 14q22 16 cases each 4q22, 7q31,
  and 14q23-q24 15 cases each and 4q21, 4q23-q24, 8q22, and 12q22 14 cases each .
  Twenty-five high-level amplifications were observed in 12 samples. 12q21 and 18p
  were affected three times each and 1p21, 4q31.3, 7p21, 12q14-q15, Xp22.1-p22.2,
  and Xq22-q23 two times each. Losses were less frequent than gains. Early stages
  of adult fibrosarcomas were characterized by frequent gains of chromosomes 2, 4q,
  and 14q, whereas gains of chromosomes 7 and 8q were associated with progression.
  Gains of 12q were frequent in all of the developmental steps of this soft-tissue
  sarcoma. By investigation of several tumors of the same patient, a number of corresponding
  changes were always detected. Adult fibrosarcomas from patients who died during
  the observation time showed statistically significant more frequent gains of 8q,
  12q, 13q, and 15q compared to the fibrosarcomas of patients who are alive. Gains
  and high-level amplifications of 12q14-q22, which were the most frequent genomic
  imbalances, partly reflected an MDM2 amplification, indicating the importance of
  this region in the tumorigenesis of sarcomas. In adult fibrosarcomas, a gain of
  12q22 correlated significantly P 0.028 with a poor overall survival rate.
