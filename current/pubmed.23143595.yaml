abstract: Burkitt lymphoma is a mature aggressive B-cell lymphoma derived from germinal
  center B cells. Its cytogenetic hallmark is the Burkitt translocation t 8 14 q24
  q32 and its variants, which juxtapose the MYC oncogene with one of the three immunoglobulin
  loci. Consequently, MYC is deregulated, resulting in massive perturbation of gene
  expression. Nevertheless, MYC deregulation alone seems not to be sufficient to drive
  Burkitt lymphomagenesis. By whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing
  of four prototypical Burkitt lymphomas with immunoglobulin gene IG -MYC translocation,
  we identified seven recurrently mutated genes. One of these genes, ID3, mapped to
  a region of focal homozygous loss in Burkitt lymphoma. In an extended cohort, 36
  of 53 molecularly defined Burkitt lymphomas 68 carried potentially damaging mutations
  of ID3. These were strongly enriched at somatic hypermutation motifs. Only 6 of
  47 other B-cell lymphomas with the IG-MYC translocation 13 carried ID3 mutations.
  These findings suggest that cooperation between ID3 inactivation and IG-MYC translocation
  is a hallmark of Burkitt lymphomagenesis.
