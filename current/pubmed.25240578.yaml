abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC is nearly uniformly lethal, with a
  median overall survival in 2014 of only 6 months. The genetic progression of sporadic
  PDAC SPC is well established, with common somatic alterations in KRAS, p16 CDKN2A,
  TP53, and SMAD4 DPC4. Up to 10 of all PDAC cases occur in families with two or more
  affected first-degree relatives familial pancreatic cancer, FPC , but these cases
  do not appear to present at an obviously earlier age of onset. This is unusual because
  most familial cancer syndrome patients present at a substantially younger age than
  that of corresponding sporadic cases. Here we collated the reported age of onset
  for FPC and SPC from the literature. We then used an integrated approach including
  whole exomic sequencing, whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and high density
  SNP microarrays to study a cohort of FPC cell lines and corresponding germline samples.
  We show that the four major SPC driver genes are also consistently altered in FPC
  and that each of the four detection strategies was able to detect the mutations
  in these genes, with one exception. We conclude that FPC undergoes a similar somatic
  molecular pathogenesis as SPC, and that the same gene targets can be used for early
  detection and minimal residual disease testing in FPC patients.
