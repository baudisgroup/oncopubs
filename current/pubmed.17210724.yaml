abstract: In addition to RB1 gene mutations, retinoblastomas frequently show gains
  of 1q and 6p and losses of 16q. To identify suppressor genes on 16q, we analyzed
  22 short tandem repeat loci in 58 patients with known RB1 mutations. A subset of
  tumors was also investigated by conventional and matrix comparative genomic hybridization.
  In 40 of 58 69 tumors, we found no loss of heterozygosity LOH at any 16q marker.
  LOH was detected in 18 of 58 31 tumors, including five with allelic imbalance at
  some markers. In one tumor LOH was only observed at 16q24. As the parental origin
  of allele loss was unbiased, an imprinted locus is unlikely to be involved. Analysis
  of gene expression by microarray hybridization and quantitative RT real-time PCR
  did not identify a candidate suppressor in 16q24. Cadherin 13 CDH13 , CBFA2T3, and
  WFDC1, which are candidate suppressors in other tumor entities with 16q24 loss,
  did not show loss of expression. In addition, mutation and methylation analysis
  showed no somatic alteration of CDH13. Results in all tumors with chromosome 16
  alterations define a single minimal deleted region of 5.7 Mb in the telomeric part
  of 16q24 with the centromeric boundary defined by retention of heterozygosity for
  a single nucleotide variant in exon 10 of CDH13 Mb 82.7 . Interestingly, clinical
  presentation of tumors with and without 16q alterations was distinct. Specifically,
  almost all retinoblastomas with 16q24 loss showed diffuse intraocular seeding. This
  suggests that genetic alterations in the minimal deleted region are associated with
  impaired cell-to-cell adhesion.
