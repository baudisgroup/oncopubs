abstract: 'Carcinosarcomas are malignant tumors with a mixture of carcinomatous and
  differentiated sarcomatous elements. We investigate the morphology, immunohistochemistry,
  and comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 3 mixed squamous carcinoma and
  osteosarcoma of the lung. All patients were male and their ages were 72, 43, and
  58 years. The sizes of the neoplasms were 7, 5, and 5 cm in maximum diameter, respectively.
  Two patients died of the disease 9 and 14 months after surgery and one is alive
  6 months later. By light microscopy, all cases had both squamous and osteosarcomatous
  structures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for AE3AE1, p63, 34 E12, CAM 5.2 2
  3 cases , CK-7 2 3 cases , epithelial membrane antigen, E-cadherin, p53, and carcinogenic
  embryonic antigen in carcinomatous areas, and for vimentin and CD-68 in sarcomatous
  component. Areas of transition positive for both cytokeratins and vimentin were
  seen in all cases. A total of 55 copy number changes were detected with a median
  of 18 abnormalities per case: 48 gains, 6 losses, and 1 high-level amplification.
  Chromosome alterations in osteosarcomatous areas were similar to those found in
  lung metastatic osteosarcoma, comparable to those found in carcinomatous areas and
  to lung squamous carcinomas. Coincidences between carcinomatous areas and osteosarcomatous
  zones were found as gains in chromosomes 1q, 3q, 5p, 8q, and 12p. These findings
  provide arguments that favor a common origin for both types of cells, supported
  by the mixture of cells, the existence of undifferentiated cells positive to both
  cytokeratin and vimentin markers, and the CGH overlaps of chromosomal gains between
  carcinomatous and sarcomatous areas.'
