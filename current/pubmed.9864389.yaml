abstract: In order to investigate genomic imbalances, comparative genomic hybridization
  was applied to 20 malignant fibrous histiocytomas. Deletions were rare and found
  mainly in chromosomes 2q33-35, 4q32-qter, 8p, 9p21-pter, 12p and 19p, whereas, over-representations
  frequently affected chromosomes 3, 4q31, 5p, 6, 7, 14q22-ter, 18p, as well as, five
  distinct amplifications within the regions 12q12-15 and 15q24-qter. The total number
  of genetic imbalances per tumor was slightly increased in primary tumors when compared
  to relapses. No relationship was found between the patterns of gain and loss when
  compared to the histological subtype, tumor grading, the clinical outcome and the
  p53 mutation status.
