abstract: Colorectal carcinoma CRC remains the major cause of cancer death in humans.
  Although chromosomal structural anomaly is presumed to play an important role in
  the carcinogenesis of CRC, chromosomal copy number alterations CNA and loss of heterozygosity
  LOH have not yet been analyzed extensively at high resolution in CRC. Here we aim
  to identify recurrent CNA and LOH in human CRC with the use of single nucleotide
  polymorphism-typing microarrays, and to reveal their relevance to clinical outcome.
  Surgically resected CRC specimens and paired normal mucosa were obtained from a
  consecutive series of 94 patients with CRC, and both of them were subjected to genotyping
  with Affymetrix Mapping 50K arrays. CNA and LOH were inferred computationally on
  every single nucleotide polymorphism site by integrating the array data for paired
  specimens. Our large dataset reveals recurrent CNA in CRC at chromosomes 7, 8, 13,
  18, and 20, and recurrent LOH at chromosomes 1p, 4q, 5q, 8p, 11q, 14q, 15q, 17p,
  18, and 22. Frequent uniparental disomy was also identified in chromosomes 8p, 17p,
  and 18q. Very common CNA and LOH were present at narrow loci of amp lt 1 Mbp containing
  only a few genes. In addition, we revealed a number of novel CNA and LOH that were
  linked statistically to the prognosis of the patients. The precise and large-scale
  measurement of CNA and LOH in the CRC genome is efficient for pinpointing prognosis-related
  genome regions as well as providing a list of unknown genes that are likely to be
  involved in CRC development.
