abstract: Cytogenetic analysis of a lumbar soft tissue Ewing sarcoma ES in a 7-month-old
  female child showed a t 17 22 q21 q12 , a rare translocation leading to an EWSR1-ETV4
  chimeric transcript. These findings were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH techniques. The
  breakpoints were characterized by direct sequencing of the chimeric fusion gene.
  Tumor genotyping using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP array 6.0 Genechip identified deletions of both chromosomal regions involved
  in the translocation, resulting in partial deletion of ETV4, but an uninvolved EWSR1
  gene. The creation of a fusion between EWSR1 and an ETS family gene consecutive
  to a chromosomal translocation is characteristic of the Ewing family of tumors EFT
  . This is the first report of a deletion involving the two breakpoints in an EWS-ETS
  translocation. To date, only two cases of t 17 22 q21 q12 in Ewing sarcoma have
  been reported, with no associated deletion. Interestingly, both cases had also occurred
  in soft tissue tumors, which are less common than their bone-involving counterparts.
