abstract: Gastric cancers frequently show chromosomal alterations which can cause
  activation of oncogenes, and or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. In gastric
  cancer several chromosomal regions are described to be frequently lost, but for
  most of the regions, no tumour suppressor genes have been identified yet. The present
  study aimed to identify tumour suppressor genes inactivated by nonsense mutation
  and deletion in gastric cancer by means of GINI gene identification by nonsense
  mediated decay inhibition and whole genome copy number analysis.
