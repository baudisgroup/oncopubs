abstract: We studied DNA copy number changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using
  comparative genomic hybridization analysis on 20 primary tumors and on 12 recurrent
  tumors excised after chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Twenty-nine 91 of the cases showed
  abnormal copy number karyotypes. Chromosomal regions at X 41 , 1q 38 , 7 31 , 3
  24 , 6p 21 , 11 21 , 12 21 , and 18 21 were most frequently gained, and the most
  common losses involved 6q 38 , X 21 , 1p 14 , and 8p 10 . High-level amplifications
  were observed at 6p23-ter, 10p12-14, 17p1l.2, 18q21-ter, and Xq22-ter, all but 18q
  appearing only in the recurrent tumors. Gains median, 2 range, 0 to 10 were more
  frequent than losses median, 1 range, 0 to 7 P .0004 . The median number of aberrations
  found in the recurrent tumors 6.5 was greater than that in the primary tumors 2
  P .01 . The copy number changes found in the recurrent tumors were more random than
  those found in the primary tumors, which were mainly located in the most frequently
  affected regions. Our findings are in line with those observed using conventional
  cytogenetic analysis, but especially novel high-level amplifications were detected.
  Southern blot analysis showed BCL2 amplification, but not translocation t 14 18
  q32 q21 , in cases in which a gain at 18q was detected by comparative genomic hybridization,
  which strongly suggests that, in addition to translocation, gene amplification is
  another mechanism for the overexpression of the BCL2 protein.
