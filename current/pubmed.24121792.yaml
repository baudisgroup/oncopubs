abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with transitional
  cell carcinoma TCC being the predominant form. Here we report a genomic analysis
  of TCC by both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 99 individuals with TCC.
  Beyond confirming recurrent mutations in genes previously identified as being mutated
  in TCC, we identified additional altered genes and pathways that were implicated
  in TCC. Notably, we discovered frequent alterations in STAG2 and ESPL1, two genes
  involved in the sister chromatid cohesion and segregation SCCS process. Furthermore,
  we also detected a recurrent fusion involving FGFR3 and TACC3, another component
  of SCCS, by transcriptome sequencing of 42 DNA-sequenced tumors. Overall, 32 of
  the 99 tumors 32 harbored genetic alterations in the SCCS process. Our analysis
  provides evidence that genetic alterations affecting the SCCS process may be involved
  in bladder tumorigenesis and identifies a new therapeutic possibility for bladder
  cancer.
