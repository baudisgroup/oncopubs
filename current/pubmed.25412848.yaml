abstract: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare and aggressive histologic type of
  breast cancer, preferentially displaying a triple-negative phenotype. We sought
  to define the transcriptomic heterogeneity of metaplastic breast cancers on the
  basis of current gene expression microarray-based classifiers, and to determine
  whether these tumors display gene copy number profiles consistent with those of
  BRCA1-associated breast cancers. Twenty-eight consecutive triple-negative metaplastic
  breast carcinomas were reviewed, and the metaplastic component present in each frozen
  specimen was defined (ie, spindle cell, squamous, chondroid metaplasia). RNA and
  DNA extracted from frozen sections with tumor cell content >60% were subjected to
  gene expression (Illumina HumanHT-12 v4) and copy number profiling (Affymetrix SNP
  6.0), respectively. Using the best practice PAM50/claudin-low microarray-based classifier,
  all metaplastic breast carcinomas with spindle cell metaplasia were of claudin-low
  subtype, whereas those with squamous or chondroid metaplasia were preferentially
  of basal-like subtype. Triple-negative breast cancer subtyping using a dedicated
  website (http://cbc.mc.vanderbilt.edu/tnbc/) revealed that all metaplastic breast
  carcinomas with chondroid metaplasia were of mesenchymal-like subtype, spindle cell
  carcinomas preferentially of unstable or mesenchymal stem-like subtype, and those
  with squamous metaplasia were of multiple subtypes. None of the cases was classified
  as immunomodulatory or luminal androgen receptor subtype. Integrative clustering,
  combining gene expression and gene copy number data, revealed that metaplastic breast
  carcinomas with spindle cell and chondroid metaplasia were preferentially classified
  as of integrative clusters 4 and 9, respectively, whereas those with squamous metaplasia
  were classified into six different clusters. Eight of the 26 metaplastic breast
  cancers subjected to SNP6 analysis were classified as BRCA1-like. The diversity
  of histologic features of metaplastic breast carcinomas is reflected at the transcriptomic
  level, and an association between molecular subtypes and histology was observed.
  BRCA1-like genomic profiles were found only in a subset (31%) of metaplastic breast
  cancers, and were not associated with a specific molecular or histologic subtype.
