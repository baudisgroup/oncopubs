abstract: The identification of lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS in a patients specimen
  confers an appreciable increased risk of development of future invasive mammary
  carcinoma. However, the study of LCIS presents a challenge as it is usually only
  recognized in fixed specimens. Recent advances in high throughput genomics have
  made possible comprehensive copy number analysis of lesions such as this. Using
  array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH , we characterized eight cases of lobular
  carcinoma four invasive and four non-invasive from microdissected samples of archival
  specimens and validated our results by quantitative real-time PCR qRT-PCR . Immunohistochemistry
  IHC was performed on an independent set of 80 in situ ductal DCIS and lobular breast
  lesions to confirm our results. Amplification of the prolactin receptor gene PRLr
  was identified in 4 4 cases of LCIS by aCGH. We confirmed this amplification by
  qRT-PCR and demonstrated PRLr expression in 29 40 73 cases of lobular neoplasia
  by IHC. Amplification of PRLr was neither detected in 10 cases of DCIS nor in 5
  areas of normal breast tissue by qRT-PCR and only 14 40 35 cases of DCIS showed
  PRLr expression by IHC P 0.0008 . Our study suggests the prolactin receptor gene
  is a molecular target that may be important in the pathogenesis and progression
  of lobular neoplasia. Investigation of the status of this gene in cases of DCIS
  has indicated that it may not be as important in the progression of this type of
  breast cancer, supporting the view that lobular and ductal carcinomas may evolve
  along separate pathways.
