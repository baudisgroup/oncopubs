abstract: The prognosis of lung cancer remains poor and clinically applicable prognostic
  markers have not yet been satisfactory identified. Several chromosomal copy number
  alterations CNAs have been associated with metastasis, relapse, and survival of
  patients with lung cancer however, no study has focused exclusively on identifying
  CNAs at a gene level. The aim of this study was to identify genes whose CNAs are
  associated with survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
