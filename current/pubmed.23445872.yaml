abstract: Pediatric follicular lymphoma is a rare disease that differs genetically
  and clinically from its adult counterpart. With the exception of pediatric follicular
  lymphoma with IRF4-translocation, the genetic events associated with these lymphomas
  have not yet been defined. We applied array-comparative genomic hybridization and
  molecular inversion probe assay analyses to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues
  from 18 patients aged 18 years and under with IRF4 translocation negative follicular
  lymphoma. All evaluable cases lacked t 14 18 . Only 6 of 16 evaluable cases displayed
  chromosomal imbalances with gains or amplifications of 6pter-p24.3 including IRF4
  and deletion and copy number neutral-loss of heterozygosity in 1p36 including TNFRSF14
  being most frequent. Sequencing of TNFRSF14 located in the minimal region of loss
  in 1p36.32 showed nine mutations in 7 cases from our series. Two subsets of pediatric
  follicular lymphoma were delineated according to the presence of molecular alterations,
  one with genomic aberrations associated with higher grade and or diffuse large B-cell
  lymphoma component and more widespread disease, and another one lacking genetic
  alterations associated with more limited disease.
