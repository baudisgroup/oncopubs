abstract: Breast cancer subtypes exhibit different genomic aberration patterns with
  a tendency for high-level amplifications in distinct chromosomal regions. These
  genomic aberrations may drive carcinogenesis through the upregulation of proto-oncogenes.
  We have characterized DNA amplification at the human chromosomal region 13q34 in
  breast cancer.
