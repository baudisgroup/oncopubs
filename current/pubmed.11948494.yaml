abstract: Using comparative genomic hybridization, DNA copy number changes were studied
  in 14 pleomorphic liposarcomas and compared to those detected in high-grade areas
  of 9 dedifferentiated liposarcomas. A total of 251 gains and 84 losses were detected.
  The most frequent gains involved subregions of chromosomal arms 12q and 20q 70 each
  , 5p 57 , 6q and 9q 52 each , 1q, 7p and 17p 48 each , 1p 43 , 6p and 17q 39 each
  , 20p and 22q 35 each as well as 7q and 12p 30 each . The same subregions were also
  affected by 30 high level amplifications. The most frequent losses were found in
  subregions of chromosomal arms 13q 35 as well as 11q and 12p 30 each . Overall,
  gains of chromosomal material were more frequent than losses p amp lt 0.001 . There
  were significant differences in the frequency and distribution of recurrent chromosomal
  imbalances between pleomorphic liposarcomas and the dedifferentiated areas of dedifferentiated
  liposarcomas. Gains of chromosomal material detected predominantly in pleomorphic
  liposarcomas involved subbands 5p13-p15 p amp lt 0.010 , 1p21 p amp lt 0.019 , 1q21-q22
  p amp lt 0.040 and 7q22 p amp lt 0.049 . Conversely, high level amplifications within
  chromosomal subregion 12q13-q21 were only found in the dedifferentiated components
  of dedifferentiated liposarcomas p amp lt 0.001 . Overall, both gains and the less
  pronounced losses of chromosomal material were more frequent in pleomorphic than
  in dedifferentiated liposarcomas p amp lt 0.001 and p amp lt 0.025, respectively
  . These results show that pleomorphic liposarcomas display a considerable number
  of recurrent chromosomal imbalances that are essentially different from those present
  in high-grade areas of dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Therefore, genetic data are
  considered as a helpful diagnostic adjunct for the discrimination between these
  2 types of liposarcoma. The overall higher frequency of chromosomal imbalances in
  pleomorphic as compared to dedifferentiated liposarcomas could account for the more
  aggressive biological behavior of pleomorphic relative to dedifferentiated liposarcoma
  types.
