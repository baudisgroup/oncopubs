abstract: Endometrial stromal sarcomas ESS are very rare neoplasms constituting less
  than 0.5 of all malignant uterine tumors. The aim of the present study was to characterize
  the karyotypic abnormalities in these malignant mesenchymal tumors and to find specific
  chromosomal aberrations with eventual correlation with histologic grades.
