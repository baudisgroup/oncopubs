abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Genomics has substantially changed our approach to cancer research.
  Gene expression profiling, for example, has been utilized to delineate subtypes
  of cancer, and facilitated derivation of predictive and prognostic signatures. The
  emergence of technologies for the high resolution and genome-wide description of
  genetic and epigenetic features has enabled the identification of a multitude of
  causal DNA events in tumors. This has afforded the potential for large scale integration
  of genome and transcriptome data generated from a variety of technology platforms
  to acquire a better understanding of cancer. RESULTS: Here we show how multi-dimensional
  genomics data analysis would enable the deciphering of mechanisms that disrupt regulatory
  signaling cascades and downstream effects. Since not all gene expression changes
  observed in a tumor are causal to cancer development, we demonstrate an approach
  based on multiple concerted disruption MCD analysis of genes that facilitates the
  rational deduction of aberrant genes and pathways, which otherwise would be overlooked
  in single genomic dimension investigations. CONCLUSIONS: Notably, this is the first
  comprehensive study of breast cancer cells by parallel integrative genome wide analyses
  of DNA copy number, LOH, and DNA methylation status to interpret changes in gene
  expression pattern. Our findings demonstrate the power of a multi-dimensional approach
  to elucidate events which would escape conventional single dimensional analysis
  and as such, reduce the cohort sample size for cancer gene discovery.'
