abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to investigate changes in
  DNA copy numbers in 25 paraffin-embedded samples of pancreatic endocrine tumors
  from 23 patients. Insulin was the dominant hormone in 12, glucagon in 7, somatostatin
  in 1, and pancreatic polypeptide in 2 tumors. One to 15 mean, 8.1 changes in DNA
  copy numbers were observed in 22 of the 25 tumors. The most recurrent aberration,
  found in 68 of the tumors, involved gains in chromosome 7 with a minimal overlapping
  region at 7q11.2. Other frequent gains included chromosomes 19 60 and 14 56 . Chromosome
  arm 20q was amplified in 48 of the cases with the minimal overlapping region of
  20q11.1-13.1. The two most frequent DNA losses were found at 11q21-22 in 32 and
  at 11p13-15 in 24 of the cases. The amplified chromosomal regions contain several
  candidate genes that may be involved in islet cell tumorigenesis. The regions with
  most frequent losses are likely to contain still uncharacterized tumor suppressor
  genes. Wiley-Liss, Inc.
