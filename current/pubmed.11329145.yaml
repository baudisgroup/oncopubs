abstract: Oligo-astrocytic tumours OAs histologically show both oligodendroglial and
  astrocytic differentiation. Unequivocal criteria for delineation of OAs from pure
  oligodendroglial Os and astrocytic As tumours and for grading of OAs are lacking.
  Molecular genetic analysis may allow for a better characterization of OAs and thereby
  guide prognostic and therapeutic decisions. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  was performed on 39 gliomas with variable phenotypic expression of histological
  features characteristic of both astrocytic and oligodendroglial differentiation.
  The results show that OAs are genetically more heterogeneous than Os. In addition
  to the amp quot -1p -19q amp quot and amp quot 7 -10 amp quot subtypes that have
  been previously recognized, two additional genetic subtypes, amp quot intermediate
  amp quot and amp quot other amp quot , were identified in the present study. amp
  quot Intermediate amp quot OAs likely represent progression from amp quot -1p -19q
  amp quot tumours. The amp quot other amp quot subtype appears to represent an additional,
  heretofore unrecognized, genetic pathway s . Application of rigorously amp quot
  strict amp quot histopathological criteria, as opposed to amp quot relaxed amp quot
  criteria, for the selection of oligo-astrocytic tumours resulted in a higher percentage
  of amp quot -1p -19q amp quot tumours, but some amp quot -1p -19q amp quot tumours
  might be missed. The results suggest that molecular genetic analysis is a useful
  and valid additional tool for the classification of gliomas, particularly for the
  significant subset of tumours in which subjective histopathological criteria are
  insufficient for an unequivocal distinction between Os, As, and mixed OAs.
