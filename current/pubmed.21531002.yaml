abstract: Centrosome abnormalities occur frequently in various tumors and can cause
  chromosomal instability and eventually promote cancer development. We investigated
  the chromosome aberrations associated with centrosome abnormalities in 30 cases
  of breast cancer, combining immunohistochemical staining and comparative genomic
  hybridization. Except for some common chromosome alterations including gains of
  1q, 8q, 17q, 20q, and Xq and losses of 8p, 11q, 13q, 14q, 16q, 17p, 22q, and Xp
  that have also been seen more frequently in other studies, we discovered some new
  changes that have rarely been reported, including gains at 2p, 5p, 10p, 15q, 16p,
  18q, 21q, and 22q and losses at 6p, 8p23, 11p13-pter, 13q34, and 14q32-qter. We
  also identified some changes such as gains of 17q, 20q, and Xq and losses of 17p,
  13q, and 14q harboring candidate genes. We also explored the expression of centrosome
  protein in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Our findings provide a
  new way to explore the molecular mechanisms of breast tumorigenesis and accordingly
  potential new targets for therapy for this disease.
