abstract: Sporadic basal-like cancers BLC are a distinct class of human breast cancers
  that are phenotypically similar to BRCA1-associated cancers. Like BRCA1-deficient
  tumors, most BLC lack markers of a normal inactive X chromosome Xi . Duplication
  of the active X chromosome and loss of Xi characterized almost half of BLC cases
  tested. Others contained biparental but nonheterochromatinized X chromosomes or
  gains of X chromosomal DNA. These abnormalities did not lead to a global increase
  in X chromosome transcription but were associated with overexpression of a small
  subset of X chromosomal genes. Other, equally aneuploid, but non-BLC rarely displayed
  these X chromosome abnormalities. These results suggest that X chromosome abnormalities
  contribute to the pathogenesis of BLC, both inherited and sporadic.
