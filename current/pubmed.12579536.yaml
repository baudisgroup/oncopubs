abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular relationship between
  multiple tumour nodules in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC within individual patients
  and to evaluate their clonality, which may bear prognostic significance. In 25 HCC
  nodules from 11 patients with multiple HCCs, the clonal relationships of the nodules
  within individual patients were determined using DNA fingerprinting with loss of
  heterozygosity LOH assay, comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and hepatitis
  B virus HBV integration pattern. Both LOH assay and CGH indicated that in four 36
  of the 11 patients, the multiple HCCs had different clonalities and hence were of
  multicentric origin, whereas in the remaining seven 64 patients, the multiple HCCs
  had similar clonal relationships and were intrahepatic metastases. In selected cases,
  the HBV integration pattern helped to confirm the clonality results. Gross appearance,
  size, location, and histology of the tumours could not accurately predict their
  clonal origin in every case. Assessment of DNA alterations allows precise determination
  of the clonality of multiple HCCs within one patient. Of these molecular methods,
  LOH analysis can be used to evaluate tumour clonality in most patients even before
  surgical resection, since this assay can be readily applied routinely to either
  liver biopsies or fine needle aspirates.
