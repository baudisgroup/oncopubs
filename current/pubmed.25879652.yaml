abstract: 'Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC) are relatively rare malignant tumors
  associated with a poor prognosis. Recent studies using genome-wide sequencing technologies
  have mainly focused on identifying new driver mutations. There is nevertheless a
  need to investigate the spectrum of copy number aberrations in order to identify
  potential target genes in the altered chromosomal regions. The aim of this study
  was to characterize the patterns of chromosomal copy-number alterations (CNAs) in
  ICC.  53 patients having ICC with frozen material were selected. In 47 cases, DNA
  hybridization has been performed on a genomewide SNP array. A procedure with a segmentation
  step and a calling step classified genomic regions into copy-number aberration states.
  We identified the exclusively amplified and deleted recurrent genomic areas. These
  areas are those showing the highest estimated propensity level for copy loss (resp.
  copy gain) together with the lowest level for copy gain (resp. copy loss). We investigated
  ICC clustering. We analyzed the relationships between CNAs and clinico-pathological
  characteristics.  The overall genomic profile of ICC showed many alterations with
  higher rates for the deletions. Exclusively deleted genomic areas were 1p, 3p and
  14q. The main exclusively amplified genomic areas were 1q, 7p, 7q and 8q. Based
  on the exclusively deleted/amplified genomic areas, a clustering analysis identified
  three tumors groups: the first group characterized by copy loss of 1p and copy gain
  of 7p, the second group characterized by 1p and 3p copy losses without 7p copy gain,
  the last group characterized mainly by very few CNAs. From univariate analyses,
  the number of tumors, the size of the largest tumor and the stage were significantly
  associated with shorter time recurrence. We found no relationship between the number
  of altered cytobands or tumor groups and time to recurrence.  This study describes
  the spectrum of chromosomal aberrations across the whole genome. Some of the recurrent
  exclusive CNAs harbor candidate target genes. Despite the absence of correlation
  between CNAs and clinico-pathological characteristics, the co-occurence of 7p gain
  and 1p loss in a subgroup of patients may suggest a differential activation of EGFR
  and its downstream pathways, which may have a potential effect on targeted therapies.'
