abstract: Neuroblastoma has successfully served as a model system for the identification
  of neuroectoderm-derived oncogenes. However, in spite of various efforts, only a
  few clinically useful prognostic markers have been found. Here, we present a framework,
  which integrates DNA, RNA and tissue data to identify and prioritize genetic events
  that represent clinically relevant new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers
  for neuroblastoma.
