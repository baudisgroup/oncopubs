abstract: Structural rearrangements form a major class of somatic variation in cancer
  genomes. Local chromosome shattering, termed chromothripsis, is a mechanism proposed
  to be the cause of clustered chromosomal rearrangements and was recently described
  to occur in a small percentage of tumors. The significance of these clusters for
  tumor development or metastatic spread is largely unclear.
