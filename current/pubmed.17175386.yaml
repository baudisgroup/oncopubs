abstract: Fibrosarcoma of bone is a rare malignant tumor accounting for less than
  5 of all primary malignant bone neoplasms. There is very limited knowledge regarding
  the molecular genetics of this tumor, and there are no cytogenetic data available.
  In the present study, a fibrosarcoma deriving from the left iliac bone of a 10-year-old
  girl was characterized using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  , and whole genome tiling resolution array comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . Cytogenetic and FISH analyses revealed a ring chromosome 6 as the sole acquired
  aberration, a finding corroborated by array CGH. The ring formation, however, did
  not result in any gain of genetic material. Nor did the breakpoints in 6p25 and
  6q14 seem to affect any known gene loci in such a way that the ring formation could
  have resulted in the creation of a fusion gene or in the exchange of regulatory
  sequences. Thus, a reasonable interpretation of the pathogenetic significance of
  the ring formation would be that it resulted in the loss of one or more putative
  tumor suppressor gene loci distal to the two breakpoints.
