abstract: Mucinous carcinomas are a rare entity accounting for up to 2 of all breast
  cancers, which have been shown to display a gene expression profile distinct from
  that of invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type IDC-NSTs . Here, we have defined
  the genomic aberrations that are characteristic of this special type of breast cancer
  and have investigated whether mucinous carcinomas might constitute a genomic entity
  distinct from IDC-NSTs. Thirty-five pure and 11 mixed mucinous breast carcinomas
  were assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against oestrogen receptor
  ER , progesterone receptor, HER2, Ki67, cyclin D1, cortactin, Bcl-2, p53, E-cadherin,
  basal markers, neuroendocrine markers, and WT1. Fifteen pure mucinous carcinomas
  and 30 grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs were microdissected and subjected to high-resolution
  microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . In addition, the distinct
  components of seven mixed mucinous carcinomas were microdissected separately and
  subjected to aCGH. Pure mucinous carcinomas consistently expressed ER 100 , lacked
  HER2 expression 97.1 , and showed a relatively low level of genetic instability.
  Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that pure mucinous carcinomas
  were homogeneous and preferentially clustered together, separately from IDC-NSTs.
  They less frequently harboured gains of 1q and 16p and losses of 16q and 22q than
  grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs, and no pure mucinous carcinoma displayed concurrent
  1q gain and 16q loss, a hallmark genetic feature of low-grade IDC-NSTs. Finally,
  both components of all but one mixed mucinous carcinoma displayed similar patterns
  of genetic aberrations and preferentially clustered together with pure mucinous
  carcinomas on unsupervised clustering analysis. Our results demonstrate that mucinous
  carcinomas are more homogeneous between themselves at the genetic level than IDC-NSTs.
  Both components of mixed mucinous tumours are remarkably similar at the molecular
  level to pure mucinous cancers, suggesting that mixed mucinous carcinomas may be
  best classified as variants of mucinous cancers rather than of IDC-NSTs.
