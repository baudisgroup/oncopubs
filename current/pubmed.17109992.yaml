abstract: Genomic alterations have been identified in lung cancer tissues and reported
  in numerous studies. To analyze genomic aberrations in lung cancer patients, we
  used array comparative genomic hybridization array CGH in 14 squamous cell lung
  carcinoma SqC tissues. Copy number gain and loss in chromosomal regions were detected,
  and the corresponding genes were confirmed by real time PCR. Several frequently
  altered loci, including gain of 3q 36 of samples , were found. The most frequently
  identified losses were found at 14q32.33 21 of samples . The relative degree of
  chromosomal change was analyzed using log2 ratios. High-level DNA amplifications
  amp gt 0.8 log2 ratio were detected at 20 regions in 1p, 2q, 3q, 4q, 6q, 7p, 8q,
  9p, 10q, 12q, 14q and 19p. We found that the fold change levels were highest at
  EVI1 3q26.2 , LPP 3q27-28 and FHF-1 3q28 gene loci. Our results show that array
  CGH is a useful tool for identification of gene alteration in lung cancer, and that
  the above-mentioned genes might represent potential candidate genes for pathogenesis
  and diagnosis of lung cancer.
