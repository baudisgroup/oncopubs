abstract: In a study of 109 colorectal cancers, DNA copy number aberrations were identified
  by comparative genomic hybridization using a DNA microarray covering the entire
  genome at an average interval of less than 1 Mbase. Four patterns were revealed
  by unsupervised clustering analysis, one of them associated with significantly better
  prognosis than the others. This group contained tumours with short, dispersed, and
  relatively few regions of copy number gain or loss. The good prognosis of this group
  was not attributable to the presence of tumours showing microsatellite instability
  MSI-H . Supervised methods were employed to determine those genomic regions where
  copy number alterations correlate significantly with multiple indices of aggressive
  growth lymphatic spread, recurrence, and early death . Multivariate analysis identified
  DNA copy number loss at 18q12.2, harbouring a single gene, BRUNOL4 that encodes
  the Bruno-like 4 splicing factor, as an independent prognostic indicator. The data
  show that the different patterns of DNA copy number alterations in primary tumours
  reveal prognostic information and can aid identification of novel prognosis-associated
  genes.
