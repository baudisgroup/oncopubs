abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme GBM displays multiple amplicons and
  homozygous deletions that involve relevant pathogenic genes and other genes whose
  role remains unknown. METHODOLOGY: Single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP -arrays were
  used to determine the frequency of recurrent amplicons and homozygous deletions
  in GBM n 46 , and to evaluate the impact of copy number alterations CNA on mRNA
  levels of the genes involved. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recurrent amplicons were detected
  for chromosomes 7 50 , 12 22 , 1 11 , 4 9 , 11 4 , and 17 4 , whereas homozygous
  deletions involved chromosomes 9p21 52 and 10q 22 . Most genes that displayed a
  high correlation between DNA CNA and mRNA levels were coded in the amplified chromosomes.
  For some amplicons the impact of DNA CNA on mRNA expression was restricted to a
  single gene e.g., EGFR at 7p11.2 , while for others it involved multiple genes e.g.,
  11 and 5 genes at 12q14.1-q15 and 4q12, respectively . Despite homozygous del 9p21
  and del 10q23.31 included multiple genes, association between these DNA CNA and
  RNA expression was restricted to the MTAP gene. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results
  showed a high frequency of amplicons and homozygous deletions in GBM with variable
  impact on the expression of the genes involved, and they contributed to the identification
  of other potentially relevant genes.'
