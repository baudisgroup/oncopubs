abstract: "A number of genetic variants have been associated with cancer occurrence,
  however it may be the acquired somatic mutations (SMs) that drive cancer development.
  This study investigates the potential SMs and related genetic variants associated
  with the occurrence and development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
  We identified several SMs in NOTCH1 from whole-exome sequencing and validated them
  in a 13-year cohort of 128 HNSCC patients using a high-resolution melting analysis
  and resequencing. Patients who have NOTCH1 SMs show higher 5-year relapse-free recurrence
  (Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x890.0013) and lower survival proportion (Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x890.0447)
  when the risk-associated SMs were analysed by Cox proportional hazard models. Interestingly,
  the NOTCH1 gene rs139994842 that shares linkage with SMs is associated with HNSCC
  risk (ORâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x893.46), increasing when SMs in NOTCH1 are involved (ORâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x897.74),
  and furthermore when there are SMs in conjunction to betel quid chewing (ORâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x8932.11),
  which is a related independent environmental risk factor after adjusting for substances
  use (alcohol, betel quid, cigarettes) and age. The findings indicate that betel
  quid chewing is highly associated with NOTCH1 SMs (especially with changes in EGF-like
  domains), and that rs139994842 may potentially serve as an early predictive and
  prognostic biomarker for the occurrence and development of HNSCC."
