abstract: Chromosomal abnormalities, such as 13q deletions, are emerging as important
  prognostic factors in multiple myeloma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  using specific DNA probes is the technique most widely used for the determination
  of genomic aberrations in this disease. The utility of comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH for molecular diagnostics in plasma cell malignancies has not been systematically
  analysed. We investigated tumour samples of patients with multiple myeloma n 43
  or plasma cell leukaemia n 3 using CGH and FISH with five DNA probes localized to
  chromosome bands 1p22, 6q21, 11q22-q23, 13q14 and 17p13. By CGH, the most frequent
  genomic changes were gains on chromosomes 1q, 9q and 11q, as well as losses on chromosomes
  13q, 6q, Xp and Xq. By FISH, trisomy 11q was identified at a similar frequency to
  the 13q deletion 42 . Compared with FISH data, the sensitivity of CGH was 80.7 and
  the specificity was 97.5 . Thirty-two aberrations found by FISH were not identified
  by CGH, mostly as a result of the proportion of cells carrying the respective aberrations,
  or because of the limited spatial resolution of CGH. Our data indicate that, for
  clinical molecular diagnostics in multiple myeloma, FISH with a disease-specific
  DNA probe set is superior to CGH analysis.
