abstract: There is strong evidence that ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS represents a
  precursor lesion of invasive breast cancer. In order to analyse specific chromosomal
  alterations of DCIS, 38 paraffin-embedded specimens of DCIS and six associated invasive
  carcinomas were examined by means of comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Losses
  of 16q material were seen almost exclusively in well- and intermediately-differentiated
  DCIS. These two subgroups differed in the average number of genetic imbalances,
  2.5 and 5.5 respectively. Additionally, a higher frequency of gains of 1q and losses
  of 11q material was seen in intermediately-differentiated in contrast to well-differentiated
  DCIS. Poorly-differentiated DCIS displayed a higher frequency of amplifications
  17q12, 11q13 and a higher average rate of genetic imbalances 7.1 . Analysis of adjacent
  invasive breast carcinoma revealed a genetic pattern almost identical to the one
  seen in the DCIS counterpart. These data characterize DCIS as a genetically far-advanced,
  heterogeneous lesion and as a direct precursor of invasive breast cancer.
