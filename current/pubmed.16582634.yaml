abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common tumor arising in the central
  nervous system. Patients with these tumors have limited treatment options and their
  disease is invariably fatal. Molecularly targeted agents offer the potential to
  improve patient treatment, however the use of these will require a fuller understanding
  of the genetic changes in these complex tumors. In this study, we identify copy
  number changes in a series of glioblastoma multiforme tumors and cell lines by applying
  high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization. Molecular cytogenetic
  characterization of the cell lines revealed that copy number changes define translocation
  breakpoints. We focused on chromosome 6 and further characterized three regions
  of copy number change associated with translocations including a discrete deletion
  involving IGF2R, PARK2, PACRG and QKI and an unbalanced translocation involving
  POLH, GTPBP2 and PTPRZ1.
