abstract: Copy number variations CNVs have been shown to contribute substantially
  to disease susceptibility in several inherited diseases including cancer. We conducted
  a genome-wide search for CNVs in blood-derived DNA from 79 individuals 62 melanoma
  patients and 17 spouse controls of 30 high-risk melanoma-prone families without
  known segregating mutations using genome-wide comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH tiling arrays. We identified a duplicated region on chromosome 4q13 in germline
  DNA of all melanoma patients in a melanoma-prone family with three affected siblings.
  We confirmed the duplication using quantitative PCR and a custom-made CGH array
  design spanning the 4q13 region. The duplicated region contains 10 genes, most of
  which encode CXC chemokines. Among them, CXCL1 melanoma growth-stimulating activity  and
  IL8 interleukin 8 have been shown to stimulate melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo.
  Our data suggest that the alteration of CXC chemokine genes may confer susceptibility
  to melanoma.
