abstract: Bladder carcinogenesis is believed to follow two alternative pathways driven
  by the loss of chromosome 9 and the gain of chromosome 7, albeit other nonrandom
  copy number alterations CNAs were identified. However, confirmation studies are
  needed since many aspects of this model remain unclear and considerable heterogeneity
  among cases has emerged. One of the purposes of this study was to evaluate the performance
  of a targeted test UroVysion assay widely used for the detection of Transitional
  Cell Carcinoma TCC of the bladder, in two different types of material derived from
  the same tumor. We compared the results of UroVysion test performed on Freshly Isolated
  interphasic Nuclei FIN and on Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded FFPE tissues from
  22 TCCs and we didnt find substantial differences. A second goal was to assess the
  concordance between array-CGH profiles and the targeted chromosomal profiles of
  UroVysion assay on an additional set of 10 TCCs, in order to evaluate whether UroVysion
  is an adequately sensitive method for the identification of selected aneuploidies
  and nonrandom CNAs in TCCs. Our results confirmed the importance of global genomic
  screening methods, that is array based CGH, to comprehensively determine the genomic
  profiles of large series of TCCs tumors. However, this technique has yet some limitations,
  such as not being able to detect low level mosaicism, or not detecting any change
  in the number of copies for a kind of compensatory effect due to the presence of
  high cellular heterogeneity. Thus, it is still advisable to use complementary techniques
  such as array-CGH and FISH, as the former is able to detect alterations at the genome
  level not excluding any chromosome, but the latter is able to maintain the individual
  data at the level of single cells, even if it focuses on few genomic regions.
