abstract: 'Estimates suggest that up to 30 of colorectal cancers CRC may develop due
  to an increased genetic risk. The mean age at diagnosis for CRC is about 70 years.
  Time of disease onset 20 years younger than the mean age is assumed to be indicative
  of genetic susceptibility. We have compared high resolution tumor genome copy number
  variation CNV Roche NimbleGen, 385 000 oligo CGH array in microsatellite stable
  MSS tumors from two age groups, including 23 young at onset patients without known
  hereditary syndromes and with a median age of 44 years range: 28-53 and 17 elderly
  patients with median age 79 years range: 69-87 . Our aim was to identify differences
  in the tumor genomes between these groups and pinpoint potential susceptibility
  loci. Integration analysis of CNV and genome wide mRNA expression data, available
  for the same tumors, was performed to identify a restricted candidate gene list.'
