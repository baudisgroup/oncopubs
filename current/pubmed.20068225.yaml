abstract: Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs including
  polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis show an
  inherent tendency for transformation into leukemia MPN-blast phase , which is hypothesized
  to be accompanied by acquisition of additional genomic lesions. We, therefore, examined
  chromosomal abnormalities by high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism SNP
  array in 88 MPN patients, as well as 71 cases with MPN-blast phase, and correlated
  these findings with their clinical parameters. Frequent genomic alterations were
  found in MPN after leukemic transformation with up to 3-fold more genomic changes
  per sample compared with samples in chronic phase P amp lt .001 . We identified
  commonly altered regions involved in disease progression including not only established
  targets ETV6, TP53, and RUNX1 but also new candidate genes on 7q, 16q, 19p, and
  21q. Moreover, trisomy 8 or amplification of 8q24 MYC was almost exclusively detected
  in JAK2V617F - cases with MPN-blast phase. Remarkably, copy number-neutral loss
  of heterozygosity CNN-LOH on either 7q or 9p including homozygous JAK2V617F was
  related to decreased survival after leukemic transformation P .01 and P .016, respectively
  . Our high-density SNP-array analysis of MPN genomes in the chronic compared with
  leukemic stage identified novel target genes and provided prognostic insights associated
  with the evolution to leukemia.
