abstract: Brain tumors are the second most common childhood cancer. We used high-resolution
  array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to analyze losses and gains of genetic
  material from 24 medulloblastomas. The bacterial artificial chromosome clones were
  ordered on the array, allowing for an average resolution of approximately 420 kilobases.
  The advantage of this high resolution is that the breakpoints associated with subregional
  chromosome copy number aberrations can be accurately defined, which in turn allows
  candidate genes within these regions to be readily defined. In this analysis, we
  confirmed the frequent involvement of loss of 17p and gain of 17q, although we have
  now established the position of the breakpoint that consistently lies in the chr17:18318880-19046234
  region of the chromosome. Other frequent losses were seen on 8p, 10q, 16q, and 20p,
  and frequent gains were seen on 2p, 4p, 7, and 19. In addition, the fine-resolution
  mapping provided by aCGH made it possible to define small chromosome deletions in
  1q23.3-q24.2, 2q13.12-q13.2, 6q25-qter, 8p23.1, 10q25.1, and 12q13.12-q13.2. Overall,
  amplification events were rare, the most common involving MYC 16 , on 8q, although
  isolated events were seen in 10p11 and 3q.
