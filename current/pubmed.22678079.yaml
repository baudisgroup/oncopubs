abstract: 'While surgery is the usual treatment for localized well-differentiated
  and dedifferentiated liposarcomas WDLPS DDLPS , the therapeutic options for patients
  with advanced disease are limited. The classical antimitotic treatments are most
  often inefficient. The establishment of genetically characterized cell lines is
  therefore crucial for providing in vitro models for novel targeted therapies. We
  have used spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome
  painting and locus-specific probes, and array-comparative genomic hybridization
  to identify the chromosomal and molecular alterations of a novel cell line established
  from a recurring sclerosing WDLPS. The karyotype was hypertriploid and showed multiple
  structural anomalies. All cells retained the presence of a giant marker chromosome
  that had been previously identified in the primary cell cultures. This giant chromosome
  contained high-level amplification of chromosomal regions 12q13-21 and lacked the
  alpha-satellite centromeric sequences associated with WDLPS DDLPS. The 12q amplicon
  was large, containing 370 amplified genes. The DNA copy number ranged from 3 to
  57. The highest levels of amplification were observed at 12q14.3 for GNS, WIF1,
  and HMGA2. We analyzed the mRNA expression status by real-time reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction for six genes from this amplicon: MDM2, HMGA2, CDK4, TSPAN31,
  WIF1, and YEATS4. mRNA overexpression was correlated with genomic amplification.
  A second amplicon originating from 10p11-14 was also present in the giant marker
  chromosome. The 10p amplicon contained 62 genes, including oncogenes such as MLLT10,
  previously described in chimeric fusion with MLL in leukemias, NEBL, and BMI1.'
