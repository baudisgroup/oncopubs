abstract: Multifocal tumors developed either as independent tumors or as intrahepatic
  metastases, are very common in primary liver cancer. However, their molecular pathogenesis
  remains elusive. Herein, a patient with synchronous two hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC, designated as HCC-A and HCC-B) and one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC),
  as well as two postoperative recurrent tumors, was enrolled. Multiregional whole-exome
  sequencing was applied to these tumors to delineate the clonality and heterogeneity.
  The three primary tumors showed almost no overlaps in mutations and copy number
  variations. Within each tumor, multiregional sequencing data showed varied intratumoral
  heterogeneity (21.6% in HCC-A, 20.4% in HCC-B, 53.2% in ICC). The mutational profile
  of two recurrent tumors showed obvious similarity with HCC-A (86.7% and 86.6% respectively),
  rather than others, indicating that they originated from HCC-A. The evolutionary
  history of the two recurrent tumors indicated that intrahepatic micro-metastasis
  could be an early event during HCC progression. Notably, FAT4 was the only gene
  mutated in two primary HCCs and the recurrences. Mutation prevalence screen and
  functional experiments showed that FAT4, harboring somatic coding mutations in 26.7%
  of HCC, could potently inhibit growth and invasion of HCC cells. In HCC patients,
  both FAT4 expression and FAT4 mutational status significantly correlated with patient
  prognosis. Together, our findings suggest that spatial and temporal dissection of
  genomic alterations during the progression of multifocal liver cancer may help to
  elucidate the basis for its dismal prognosis. FAT4 acts as a putative tumor suppressor
  that is frequently inactivated in human HCC.
