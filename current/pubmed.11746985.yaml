abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect chromosomal changes
  during metastasis formation of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas HNSCCs . In
  total, 92 tumors of 54 patients were investigated. In 34 of these, the metastases
  were compared to the corresponding primary tumors. The group of metastatic tumors
  was also compared with 20 nonmetastatic tumors. Gain of 3q was the earliest genetic
  marker for invasion and metastasis and also correlated with poor prognosis. Additional
  metastasis-associated lesions were gains on 11q13, 7q11.2, 1q21-q22, and losses
  on 8p, 11p14, 11q14-qter, 10p12, 10q, and 14q. The incidence of the chromosomal
  changes was used to evaluate their significance and temporal order of appearance
  during tumor dissemination, thus leading to an extended progression model of HNSCC.
  In the clonality analysis, three different methods revealed a mean concordance of
  64 and 68 between pairs of primaries and metastases, respectively. Using different
  similarity scores, the correct metastasis was identified from the pool of all metastatic
  lesions in 19-26 of the 34 cases. The study supplements previous genetic results
  on HNSCC pathogenesis and provides criteria for multiple tumor analysis.
