abstract: 'To obtain a comprehensive genomic profile of presenting multiple myeloma
  cases we performed high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism mapping array
  analysis in 114 samples alongside 258 samples analyzed by U133 Plus 2.0 expression
  array Affymetrix . We examined DNA copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity
  LOH to define the spectrum of minimally deleted regions in which relevant genes
  of interest can be found. The most frequent deletions are located at 1p 30 , 6q
  33 , 8p 25 , 12p 15 , 13q 59 , 14q 39 , 16q 35 , 17p 7 , 20 12 , and 22 18 . In
  addition, copy number-neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy, was also prevalent on
  1q 8 , 16q 9 , and X 20 , and was associated with regions of gain and loss. Based
  on fluorescence in situ hybridization and expression quartile analysis, genes of
  prognostic importance were found to be located at 1p FAF1, CDKN2C , 1q ANP32E ,
  and 17p TP53 . In addition, we identified common homozygously deleted genes that
  have functions relevant to myeloma biology. Taken together, these analyses indicate
  that the crucial pathways in myeloma pathogenesis include the nuclear factor- B
  pathway, apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation, Wnt signaling, and histone modifications.
