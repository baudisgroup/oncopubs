abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a molecular cytogenetic technique
  that provides an overview on chromosomal imbalances within the whole tumor cell
  genome. This method has yet not been applied in effusion cytology. We performed
  CGH analysis in malignant effusions, fine needle aspirates, and imprint smears from
  eight ovarian adenocarcinomas, three breast carcinomas, one colon adenocarcinoma,
  and three malignant mesotheliomas. In part, CGH analysis from fresh frozen tissue
  and classic karyotyping served as controls. In this series, 14 15 cytologic specimens
  were suitable for extraction of high molecular weight DNA sufficient for reliable
  CGH analysis. CGH profiles from cytologic material were equal or even more significant
  in comparison with corresponding fresh frozen tumor samples. We conclude that CGH
  analysis from cytologic specimens may support the primary cytologic diagnosis of
  malignancy, especially in the differential diagnosis of benign proliferating mesothelium,
  malignant mesothelioma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma. CGH analysis of metastatic
  lesions may provide information on the site of the primary tumors and detects cytogenetic
  imbalances affecting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in tumor progression
  and metastatic spread.
