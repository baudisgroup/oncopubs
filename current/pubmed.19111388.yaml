abstract: Topoisomerase IIalpha is a nuclear enzyme that regulates the tertiary structure
  of DNA. The influence of topoisomerase IIalpha gene TOP2A or protein alterations
  on disease progression and treatment response in colorectal cancer CRC is unknown.
  The study investigated the clinical relevance of topoisomerase IIalpha in CRC using
  in vivo and in vitro models. Differentially expressed genes in early and late-stage
  CRC were identified by array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Cellular location
  of gene amplifications was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  . Topoisomerase IIalpha levels, proliferation index, and HER2 expression were examined
  in 228 colorectal tumors by immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of topoisomerase
  IIalpha in vitro was achieved by liposome-based transfection. Cell growth inhibition
  and apoptosis were quantified using the crystal violet assay and flow cytometry,
  respectively, in response to drug treatment. Amplification of TOP2A was identified
  in 3 7.7 tumors using array CGH and confirmed using FISH. At the protein level,
  topoisomerase IIalpha staining was observed in 157 69 tumors, and both staining
  and intensity levels were associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype p values
  0.04 and 0.005, respectively . Using logistic regression analysis, topoisomerase
  IIalpha remained significantly associated with advanced tumor stage when corrected
  for tumor proliferation p 0.007 and differentiation p 0.001 . No association was
  identified between topoisomerase IIalpha and HER2. In vitro, overexpression of topoisomerase
  IIalpha was associated with resistance to irinotecan p 0.001 and etoposide chemotherapy
  p 0.03 , an effect mediated by inhibition of apoptosis. Topoisomerase IIalpha overexpression
  is significantly associated with alterations in tumor behavior and response to drug
  treatment in CRC. Our results suggest that gene amplification may represent an important
  mechanism underlying these changes.
