abstract: 2-18 of ductal carcinoma-No Special Type NST are reported to express basal
  cell keratin 14 and such tumours may have a different metastatic pattern and prognosis.
  We performed immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins 19 luminal and 14 basal on 92
  ductal carcinoma-NST. Those tumours showing CK14 expression were further characterized
  by immunohistochemistry for myoepithelial cell phenotype and analysed by comparative
  genomic hybridization. The 7 cases of ductal carcinoma-NST exhibiting a basal cell
  phenotype were all grade III tumours and showed a molecular cytogenetic profile
  similar to more conventional myoepithelial cell carcinomas. Therefore it appears
  that grade III invasive ductal carcinomas contain a subset of tumours with specific
  morphological and cytogenetic characteristics, and probably prognosis for the patient.
