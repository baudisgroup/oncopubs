abstract: The clinical behavior of invasive cervical carcinoma of clinical stage IB
  varies considerably in tumors presenting without regional lymph node metastases.
  The early identification of patients at higher risk for poor outcome may prove useful
  because these patients would benefit from aggressive adjuvant treatments. In this
  study, comparative genomic hybridization was applied to evaluate whether genomic
  aberrations have prognostic significance in cervical carcinoma. Genomic alterations
  were evaluated in 62 cervical carcinomas of clinical stage IB. DNA sequence losses
  were most prevalent at chromosomes 4q 53 , 3p 52 , 13q 45 , 4p 44 , Xq 44 , 5q 40
  , 18q 37 , and 6q 35 . Several genomic alterations were associated with poor clinical
  outcome or metastasis. The total number of DNA aberrations tumor P amp lt 0.02 and
  the number of DNA sequence losses tumor P amp lt 0.04 were associated with disease-specific
  survival. 9p deletions were significantly more frequent in carcinomas with lymph
  node metastasis than in node-negative tumors P amp lt 0.03 . Losses of chromosome
  11p P amp lt 0.0001 and 18q P amp lt 0.01 were associated with poor prognosis in
  cervical carcinomas without lymph node metastasis. These data suggest that inactivation
  of tumor suppressor genes on chromosomes 9p, 11p, and 18q may play a role in the
  progression of cervical carcinoma.
