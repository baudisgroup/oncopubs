abstract: HL60RG, a subline of human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, has a increased
  growth rate than their parental cells. To gain information of the mechanisms involved
  in the increased growth rate of HL60RG, we performed a multiplex fluorescence in
  situ hybridization M-FISH , standard cytogenetics analysis G-banding and genome
  scan using 10K SNP mapping array on both cell types. Characteristic genomic alterations
  in HL60RG cells were identified including uniparental disomy UPD of chromosome 1,
  and hemizygous deletion in 10p and 11p. However, no such defects were observed in
  HL60 cells. Changes in gene expression in HL60RG cells were determined using expression
  arrays Affymetrix GeneChip, HU133A . Candidate genes associated with the rapid growth
  of HL60RG cells were identified. Two tumor necrosis factor receptors, TNFRSF1B type
  II tumor necrosis factor- receptor and TNFRSF8 also known as a tumor marker CD30
  , which are adjacently located on chromosome 1 showed opposing changes in gene expression
  in HL60RG cells-over-expression of TNFRSF8 and repression of TNFRSF1B. Differences
  in the DNA methylation status in the transcriptional regulatory regions of both
  genes between HL60 and HL60RG was detected by a methylation-specific PCR assay.
  In conclusion, alterations in chromosome and gene expression in HL60RG may be associated
  with increased growth rate.
