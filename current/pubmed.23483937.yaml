abstract: Uterine Leiomyomas (ULs) are the most common benign tumours affecting women
  of reproductive age. ULs represent a major problem in public health, as they are
  the main indication for hysterectomy. Approximately 40-50% of ULs have non-random
  cytogenetic abnormalities, and half of ULs may have copy number alterations (CNAs).
  Gene expression microarrays studies have demonstrated that cell proliferation genes
  act in response to growth factors and steroids. However, only a few genes mapping
  to CNAs regions were found to be associated with ULs.  We applied an integrative
  analysis using genomic and transcriptomic data to identify the pathways and molecular
  markers associated with ULs. Fifty-one fresh frozen specimens were evaluated by
  array CGH (JISTIC) and gene expression microarrays (SAM). The CONEXIC algorithm
  was applied to integrate the data.  The integrated analysis identified the top 30
  significant genes (P<0.01), which comprised genes associated with cancer, whereas
  the protein-protein interaction analysis indicated a strong association between
  FANCA and BRCA1. Functional in silico analysis revealed target molecules for drugs
  involved in cell proliferation, including FGFR1 and IGFBP5. Transcriptional and
  protein analyses showed that FGFR1 (P = 0.006 and P<0.01, respectively) and IGFBP5
  (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.006, respectively) were up-regulated in the tumours when compared
  with the adjacent normal myometrium.  The integrative genomic and transcriptomic
  approach indicated that FGFR1 and IGFBP5 amplification, as well as the consequent
  up-regulation of the protein products, plays an important role in the aetiology
  of ULs and thus provides data for potential drug therapies development to target
  genes associated with cellular proliferation in ULs.
