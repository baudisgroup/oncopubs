abstract: High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization arrayCGH profiling
  was performed on 75 primary tumors and 29 cell lines to gain further insight into
  the genetic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma and to refine genomic subclassification.
  Using a novel data-mining strategy, three major and two minor genomic subclasses
  were delineated. Eighty-three percent of tumors could be assigned to the three major
  genomic subclasses, corresponding to the three known clinically and biologically
  relevant subsets in neuroblastoma. The remaining subclasses represented 1 tumors
  with no few copy number alterations or an atypical pattern of aberrations and 2
  tumors with 11q13 amplification. Inspection of individual arrayCGH profiles showed
  that recurrent genomic imbalances were not exclusively associated with a specific
  subclass. Of particular notice were tumors with numerical imbalances typically observed
  in subtype 1 neuroblastoma, in association with genomic features of subtype 2A or
  2B. A search for prognostically relevant genomic alterations disclosed 1q gain as
  a predictive marker for therapy failure within the group of subtype 2A and 2B tumors.
  In cell lines, a high incidence of 6q loss was observed, with a 3.87-5.32 Mb region
  of common loss within 6q25.1-6q25.2. Our study clearly illustrates the importance
  of genomic profiling in relation to tumor behavior in neuroblastoma. We propose
  that genome-wide assessment of copy number alterations should ideally be included
  in the genetic workup of neuroblastoma. Further multicentric studies on large tumor
  series are warranted in order to improve therapeutic stratification in conjunction
  with other features such as age at diagnosis, tumor stage, and gene expression signatures.
