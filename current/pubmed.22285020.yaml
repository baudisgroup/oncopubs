abstract: Secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma is a malignant chondroid tumor arising
  in a benign precursor, either an osteochondroma or an enchondroma. Multiple osteochondromas
  syndrome MO is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder associated with bony growths
  in the form of osteochondromas that occasionally undergo malignant transformation
  to secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. We describe the genetic examination of
  three secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas that had arisen synchronously from osteochondromas
  in a patient with MO by chromosome banding, high resolution chromosomal comparative
  genomic hybridization, and mutation analysis of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes. In two
  of the tumors the third was not genetically informative , very similar chromosome
  abnormalities were found, indicating that they must somehow be part of the same
  neoplastic process in spite of being anatomically distinct.
