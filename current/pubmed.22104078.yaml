abstract: Follicular lymphoma FL cases with a t 14 18 q32 q21 and minimal or no additional
  karyotypic alterations, such as copy number gains and losses and or chromosomal
  rearrangements, may exhibit pathologic features and a clinical behavior similar
  to those with more complex karyotypes. This study sought to investigate whether
  the copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity cnLOH profiles of these minimally evolved
  t 14 18 q32 q21 -positive follicular lymphoma MEV-FL cases are similar to or different
  from the majority of FL cases with more karyotypic alterations. Affymetrix SNP 6.0
  array analysis was applied to the tumor genomes of 23 MEV-FL biopsy samples to assess
  for the presence of cnLOH. These cases carried either a single or no chromosomal
  abnormality in addition to t 14 18 q32 q21 as determined by karyotyping. We found
  that, although these MEV-FL cases had simple karyotypes, they showed very similar
  cnLOH profiles as compared to cytogenetically complex cases. The most frequent regions
  affected by cnLOH were 1p 17 , 6p 17 , 12q 13 and 16p 13 . Our study suggests that
  cnLOH alterations may serve as important contributors to the pathological and clinical
  manifestations of FL.
