abstract: To shed light into the molecular bases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia lacking known fusion transcripts, i.e. BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1,
  and MLL rearrangements (B-NEG ALL) and the differences between children, adolescents/young
  adults (AYA) and adults, we analyzed 168 B-NEG ALLs by genome-wide technologies.
  This approach showed that B-NEG cases carry 10.5 mutations and 9.1 copy-number aberrations/sample.
  The most frequently mutated druggable pathways were those pertaining to RAS/RTK
  (26.8%) and JAK/STAT (12.5%) signaling. In particular, FLT3 and JAK/STAT mutations
  were detected mainly in AYA and adults, while KRAS and NRAS mutations were more
  frequent in children. RAS/RTK mutations negatively affected the outcome of AYA and
  adults, but not that of children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT
  mutations had a shorter survival. In vitro experiments showed that FLT3 inhibitors
  reduced significantly the proliferation of FLT3-mutated primary B-NEG ALL cells.
  Likewise, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors reduced the proliferation of primary cells harboring
  RAS and IL7R mutations. These results refine the genetic landscape of B-NEG ALL
  and suggest that the different distribution of lesions and their prognostic impact
  might sustain the diverse outcome between children, adults and partly AYA - whose
  genomic scenario is similar to adults - and open the way to targeted therapeutic
  strategies.
