abstract: 'As data on the genomic alterations in hepatoblastoma HB are limited, 34
  HB tumors and three HB cell lines were screened for DNA copy number changes by comparative
  genomic hybridization. The average number of chromosomal imbalances per tumor was
  2.3 - 0.5 mean - SEM with gains sevenfold more frequent than losses. The most frequent
  gains of chromosomal material in HB tumors were on 2q 44 , 1q 41 , 2p 29 , 20 24
  , 22q 18 , 8q 15 , 8p and 12q 9 each , as well as 7q, 12p, and 17 6 each and the
  only recurrent loss was on 4q in 12 of cases. Highly amplified sequences were identified
  in four tumors and mapped to 2q24 in two cases, to 8q in two cases once to 8q11.2-q13
  and once to 8q11.2-q21.3 as well as to 10q24-q26 in one case. In one cell line,
  highly amplified DNA sequences were mapped to 7p and 8q. Comparison to previously
  published data on this series of HB revealed that the number of chromosomal imbalances
  was significantly higher in HB tumors with loss of heterozygosity on 11p P 0.03
  , whereas in five of 10 HB biopsies without chromosomal imbalances, beta-catenin
  gene mutations were found. HB patients were divided into a good no evidence of disease
  and a poor died of disease outcome group according to their clinical course after
  standard therapy. Two alterations were found to be significantly associated with
  poor outcome: gain on 8q P 0.007 and gain on 20 P 0.009 . In summary, our analysis
  allowed the identification of gains on chromosomes 1q and 2 as hallmark DNA copy
  number changes in HB with 2q24 as a critical chromosomal band. Furthermore, this
  study provided evidence that gains on 8q and 20 play a role as markers of prognostic
  significance in HB.'
