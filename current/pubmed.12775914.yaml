abstract: In order to explore whether specific cytogenetic abnormalities can be used
  to stratify tumors with a distinctly different clinical course, we performed comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH of tumors from patients who were diagnosed with metastatic
  disease after an interval of less than 2 years or who remained free from distant
  metastases for more than 10 years. All patients presented with distant metastases
  after mastectomy indicating that none of the patients in this study was cured and
  free of remaining tumor cells. Tumors in the group of short-term survivors showed
  a higher average number of chromosomal copy alterations compared to the long-term
  survivors. Of note, the number of sub-chromosomal high-level copy number increases
  amplifications was significantly increased in the group of short-term survivors.
  In both short- and long-term survivors recurrent chromosomal gains were mapped to
  chromosomes 1q, 4q, 8q, and 5p. Copy number changes that were more frequent in the
  group of short-term survivors included gains of chromosome 3q, 9p, 11p and 11q and
  loss of 17p. Our results indicate that low- and high grade malignant breast adenocarcinomas
  are characterized by a specific pattern of chromosomal copy number changes. Furthermore,
  immunohistochemical evaluation of the expression levels of Ki-67, p27KIP1, p21WAF1,
  p53, cyclin A and cyclin E revealed a correlation between increased proliferative
  activity and poor outcome.
