abstract: Isodicentric 17q is the most commonly reported chromosomal abnormality in
  medulloblastomas. Its frequency suggests that genes disrupted in medulloblastoma
  formation may play a role in tumorigenesis. We have previously identified two chromosome
  17 breakpoint at a 1 Mb resolution. Our aims were to accurately map the position
  of these breakpoints and to identify mechanisms of gene disruption at this site.
  CGH with a custom tiling path genomic BAC array of chromosome 17 enriched with fosmids
  at the breakpoint regions was used to analyze a series of 45 medulloblastomas and
  three medulloblastoma-derived cell lines. In total, 17 of 45 medulloblastomas had
  an isodicentric 17q. Two breakpoint regions were identified and their positions
  were mapped. The array identified a more complex arrangement at the breakpoint than
  has been reported previously using lower resolution BAC arrays. The patterns observed
  indicated that dicentric chromosome formation occurs both via nonallelic homologous
  recombination between palindromically arranged low copy repeats the previously accepted
  mechanism and by recombination between nonidentical sequences. In addition, novel
  alternative structural alterations, a homozygous deletion and a duplication, were
  identified within the chromosome breakpoint region in two cases. At the resolution
  of the array, these structural alterations spanned the same genes as cases with
  dicentric 17q formation, implying that the disruption of genes at the chromosome
  breakpoint itself may be of greater biological significance than has previously
  been suspected.
