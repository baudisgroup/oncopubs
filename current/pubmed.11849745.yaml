abstract: Neuroblastomas are heterogeneous tumors. Their clinical behavior varies
  from spontaneous regression to malignant progression. To investigate the cytogenetic
  heterogeneity of infantile neuroblastomas, we employed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . To characterize chromosomal imbalances in 35 infantile neuroblastomas, we
  performed CGH and compared our results with those of other clinical and biological
  studies. The most frequent genetic imbalances were found in chromosome 17 43 , including
  whole chromosome 17 gains in eight patients 23 and 17q gains in seven patients 20
  . A 1p loss and a 2p gain were detected in six patients each 17 . Losses of 11q
  and 14q were detected in two patients 6 and one 3 patient, respectively. The number
  of gains of 17q were significantly higher in DNA diploid tumors than in aneuploid
  tumors P 0.006 . Conversely, whole chromosome 17 gains were not found in DNA diploid
  tumors and or MYCN amplification. Interestingly, nine of 17 tumors that were histologically
  evaluated showed a spontaneous regression and did not demonstrate any partial chromosomal
  abnormalities i.e. 17q gain, 1p loss, 2p gain, 11q loss and 14q loss . These results
  suggest that a gene on chromosome 17q is associated with neuroblastoma progression.
  Finally, our observations indicate that the chromosomal imbalances observed in infantile
  neuroblastomas are different from those observed in older patients.
