abstract: Information on the clonal relationship between tumor nodules in patients
  diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma HCC holds prognostic significance in the
  prediction of recurrence and postoperative treatment. Here, we investigated the
  clonal relationships in 11 focal nodules from 5 patients with HCC by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and spectral karyotyping. CGH analysis indicated tumor
  nodules in 5 100 of 5 cases to share similar patterns of genomic imbalances, suggesting
  nodules to be clonally related. This clonal relationship was further substantiated
  in 2 cases, where spectral karyotyping analysis indicated identical structural rearrangements
  between focal tumors. Few studies have attempted to differentiate multicentric growth
  from intrahepatic dissemination in HCC using CGH analysis however, data interpretation
  remained subjective. In this study, we have extended our data to include published
  CGH findings on 57 nodules derived from 19 HCC cases. Simulation of CGH findings
  by unsupervised 2-way hierarchical clustering indicated tumor nodules in 20 83.3
  of 24 cases to cluster concordantly, signifying a high incidence of clonal similarity.
  In sum, bioinformatic analysis of genomic profiles may represent a reliable research
  tool in analyzing clonal relationships among tumor nodules.
