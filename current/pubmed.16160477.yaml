abstract: Atypical lipomatous tumor well-differentiated liposarcoma ALT-WDLPS and
  dedifferentiated liposarcoma DDLPS may be difficult to distinguish from benign adipose
  tumors and from poorly differentiated sarcomas, respectively. Genetically, they
  are characterized by amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes on chromosome 12q13-15.
  We examined a series of 559 soft tissue tumors 44 ALT-WDLPS, 61 DDLPS, 49 benign
  adipose tumors, and 405 non-ALT-WDLPS DDLPS sarcomas for MDM2 and CDK4 expression
  using immunohistochemistry. MDM2 and CDK4 immunoexpressions were compared with gene
  amplification status as assessed by quantitative PCR and or comparative genomic
  hybridization in 241 neoplasms. Most ALT-WDLPS DDLPS expressed MDM2 97 and CDK4
  92 as opposed to few benign adipose tumors MDM2, 5 CDK4, 2 and a limited number
  of non-ALT-WDLSP DDLPS sarcomas MDM2, 19 CDK4, 6 . The sensitivity and specificity
  of MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings in identifying ALT-WDLPS DDLPS among other soft
  tissue tumors were 97 and 92 , and 83 and 95 , respectively. MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings
  were particularly useful to separate ALT-WDLPS from the large group of differentiated
  adipose tumors, and to distinguish DDLPS from poorly differentiated sarcomas. A
  strong correlation was observed between MDM2 and CDK4 stainings and gene amplification
  status. In conclusion, MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings, which correlate with gene
  amplification, are helpful adjuncts to differentiate ALT-WDLPS from benign adipose
  tumors and to separate DDLPS from poorly differentiated sarcomas.
