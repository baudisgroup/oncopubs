abstract: Only limited data are available on comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC . They concern mainly B virus related HCC. Therefore,
  we used CGH to detect chromosomal imbalances in 16 non-B virus related HCC in alcoholic
  cirrhosis in 7 cases HA1 to HA7 , in C virus cirrhosis in 7 cases HC1 to HC7 , in
  non-cirrhotic liver in 2 cases NC1, NC2 , and in 9 non-malignant cirrhotic tissues.
  The most frequent imbalances in HCC were gains of whole chromosomes or chromosomal
  regions 7 or 7q 10 16, 62 , 1q 9 16, 56 , 5 or 5q 9 16, 56 , 8q 8 16, 50 , 6p 6
  16, 37 , 15q 5 16, 31 , 20 or 20q 5 16, 31 , and losses of 17p 6 16, 37 , and 8p
  5 16, 31 . High-level gains were identified in HCC on 1q 2 16 , 3q 1 16 , 7q 1 16
  , and 8q 3 16 . No chromosomal imbalances were detected in any of the cirrhotic
  tissues. Most of the gains, losses, and amplifications detected in this CGH study
  corresponded well to those identified in previous studies, except for gains of whole
  chromosome 5 or 7 and or of chromosome arms 5q or 7q and losses on 4q. Our results
  suggest that other chromosomal regions are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis.
