abstract: Prostate cancer is known for its highly heterogeneous histological appearance.
  Data concerning the cytogenetic content of areas with different histology are sparse.
  We have genetically evaluated 10 prostatic adenocarcinomas with intermediate histopathological
  grades Gleason score 7 that showed two distinctive growth patterns with different
  pathologies, that is, Gleason grades 3 and 4 G3 and G4 . The G3 and G4 tumor specimens
  were taken from spatially separated regions within the cancer mass. Array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was performed to obtain genotypes from the
  10 pairs of G3 and G4 cancer areas. The cancer DNAs were retrieved from formalin-fixed
  and paraffin-embedded tissues allowing optimal recognition and selection of target
  cells. A genome-wide 2,400-element BAC array that provided high-resolution detection
  of both deletions and amplifications was used. In the 20 G3 and G4 areas, 252 genomic
  aberrations 88 gains, 164 deletions were noted, of which 86 were concurrent in G3
  and G4 areas 34 overlap . Ninety-five of the 252 alterations were defined by a single
  BAC clone 54 gains, 41 deletions . Overlapping changes were more frequent for deletions
  46 than for gains 13 . Frequent coinciding deletions amp gt or 20 of tumors were
  seen on 8p 60 , 6q 30 , 1p 20 , 2q 20 , proximal 8q 20 , 10q 20 , 13q 20 , 16q 20
  , and 18q 20 . A frequent overlapping gain amp gt or 20 of tumors was detected on
  distal 13q 20 . The patterns of imbalance could be found to coincide in the G3 and
  G4 areas of the majority of cancers. Array-based CGH can be used as a tool for the
  evaluation of genetic patterns in prostate cancer.
