abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis of DNA extracted from a diffuse
  lymphoma with a large cell component DLLC that displayed double minute chromosomes
  upon conventional karyotypic analysis indicated overt amplification of DNA sequences
  derived from the 2p13-15 region. Southern blot analysis of this tumor DNA with a
  cDNA probe for the proto-oncogene REL, previously mapped to 2p14-15, indicated a
  greater than 35-fold amplification of REL. To determine the incidence of REL amplification
  and possible clinical or histologic association with DLLC, a panel of 111 tumor
  DNAs from DLLC specimens was screened for REL amplification by Southern blot analysis.
  A copy number of amp gt or 4 was noted in 26 cases 23 . Southern blot analysis of
  these 26 tumor DNAs with a cDNA probe for TGFA, mapped to 2p13, indicated lack of
  coamplification except in one case. Another member of the Rel NF-kappa B family
  of transcriptional activators, RELA p65 mapped to 11q13, was amplified in five cases
  as determined by Southern blot analysis using a cDNA probe. Nineteen of the 26 DLLC
  73 with REL amplification were primary extranodal lymphomas. As a group, the tumors
  with REL amplification demonstrated an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations
  previously associated with tumor progression, suggesting an oncogenic effect of
  amplified REL in B-lymphoid cells that already contained a transforming genetic
  lesion. Thus, REL amplification is a frequent event in DLLC, and probably constitutes
  a progression-associated marker of primary extranodal lymphomas. This study shows
  the usefulness of the CGH technique in identifying chromosomal regions overrepresented
  in tumors that can point to amplified genes and may be correlated with clinical
  features of the disease.
