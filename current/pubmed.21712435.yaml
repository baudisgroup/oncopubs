abstract: A positive family history, germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes,
  tumours with high microsatellite instability, and loss of mismatch repair protein
  expression are the hallmarks of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer Lynch
  syndrome . However, in 10-15 of cases of suspected Lynch syndrome, no disease-causing
  mechanism can be detected.
