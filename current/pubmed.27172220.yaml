abstract: Copy number alterations (CNA) are one of the driving mechanisms of glioma
  tumorigenesis, and are currently used as important biomarkers in the routine setting.
  Therefore, we performed CNA profiling of 65 astrocytomas of distinct malignant grades
  (WHO grade I to IV) of Brazilian origin, using array-CGH, microsatellite instability
  analysis (MSI), and investigated their correlation with TERT and IDH1 mutational
  status and clinic-pathological features. Furthermore, in silico analysis using the
  Oncomine database was performed to validate our findings and extend the findings
  to gene expression level. We found that the number of genomic alterations increases
  in accordance with glioma grade. In glioblastomas (GBM) the most common alterations
  were gene amplifications (PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, EGFR, and MET) and deletions (CDKN2A
  and PTEN). Log-rank analysis correlated EGFR amplification and/or chr7 gain with
  better survival of the patients. MSI was observed in 11% of GBMs. A total of 69%
  of GBMs presented TERT mutation, whereas IDH1 mutation was most frequent in diffuse
  (85.7%) and anaplastic (100%) astrocytomas. The combination of 1p19q deletion, TERT
  and IDH1 mutational status separate tumor groups that showed distinct age of diagnosis
  and outcome. In silico validation pointed to less explored genes that may be worthy
  of future investigation, such as CDK2, DMRTA1 and MTAP Herein, using an extensive
  integrated analysis, we indicated potentially important genes, not extensively studied
  in gliomas, that could be further explored to assess their biological and clinical
  impact in astrocytomas.  Copyright ï¿½ 2016 Author et al.
