abstract: Pediatric undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas USTS are a diagnostically
  challenging group of neoplasms. Recently, a subcategory of USTS with primitive round
  cell morphology and a t 4 19 q35 q13 rearrangement has been defined. The present
  study applied high-throughput array comparative genomic hybridization together with
  spectral karyotyping, four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , and reverse
  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR to a series of three pediatric USTS.
  Two of these had primitive round cell morphology with CD99 positivity the third
  had a spindled and myxoid appearance. By genomic analyses, both primitive round
  cell sarcomas had t 4 19 q35 q13 corrected rearrangements in addition to several
  imbalances throughout the genome. Four-color FISH and in silico analyses of the
  breakpoint region at 19q13 identified the potential involvement of the candidate
  oncogene CIC. By RT-PCR, fusion transcripts involving CIC 19q13 and DUX4 4q35 were
  confirmed to be present in both primitive round cell sarcomas, further defining
  the breakpoints seen by genomic analysis. Described here are two tumors belonging
  to the rare category of CIC-DUX4-positive primitive sarcomas, with detailed cytogenetic
  and genomic information regarding this novel subclass of pediatric malignancy. Molecular
  and cytogenetic techniques for the detection of the CIC-DUX4 fusion gene are described,
  to aid in recognition and diagnosis.
