abstract: 'Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare tumor arising from the basal layer of
  the olfactory epithelium in the superior recesses of the nasal cavity. The rarity
  of this tumor, and the difficulties in culturing tumor cells has limited the generation
  of conventional cytogenetic data, whereas consistent results have been obtained
  by recent molecular methods. We report the results of an array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis (a-CGH) obtained on 11 samples from 10 subjects:
  8 primary and 3 relapsed tumors. In one patient, both the primary and relapsed tumors
  were available. Our results on chromosome imbalances highlight the highly heterogeneous
  presentation: six of eleven samples showed multiple numerical changes and very few
  structural ones, while four samples showed an opposite pattern; one sample out of
  eleven showed no imbalances. We did not reach firm evidence of any recurrent specific
  imbalances either at level of entire chromosomes or chromosome segments. A review
  of the literature indicates a number of recurrent gains, and losses, mostly not
  confirmed by our results. Gain of chromosome 19 was the only correspondence with
  literature data concerning an entire chromosome, and most segmental gains and losses
  found in our cohort of patients were different from those indicated in the literature:
  the only similarities concerned the gain of 20q13 and the loss of segments of chromosomes
