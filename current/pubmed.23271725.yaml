abstract: Genetic changes during tumorigenesis are usually acquired sequentially.
  However, a recent study showed that in 2 to 3 of all cancers a single catastrophic
  event, termed chromothripsis, can lead to massive genomic rearrangements confined
  to one or a few chromosomes. To explore whether the degree of genomic instability
  and chromothripsis influences prognosis in cancer, we retrospectively applied array-comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH to 20 malignant melanomas that showed, despite comparable
  conventional clinical and pathologic parameters, a profoundly different clinical
  course. We compared 10 patients who died of malignant melanoma 3.7 years median,
  range 0.9-7.6 years after diagnosis with 10 patients who survived malignant melanoma
  and had a median disease-free survival of 14.8 years range 12.5-16.7 years P 0.00001
  . We observed a striking association between the degree of chromosomal instability,
  both numerical and structural, and outcome. Malignant melanomas associated with
  good prognosis showed only few chromosomal imbalances mean 1.6 alterations per case
  , predominantly whole chromosome or chromosome arm gains and losses, whereas malignant
  melanomas with poor prognosis harbored significantly more chromosomal aberrations
  13.9 per case P 0.008 . Array-based CGH showed that these aberrations were mostly
  focal events, culminating in two cases in a pattern consistent with the phenomenon
  of chromothripsis, which was confirmed by paired-end sequencing. This is the first
  description of chromothripsis in primary malignant melanomas. Our study therefore
  links focal copy number alterations and chromothripsis with poor outcome in patients
  with malignant melanomas P 0.0002 and provides a genetic approach to predict outcome
  in malignant melanomas.
