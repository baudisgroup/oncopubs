abstract: We screened 124 genes that are amplified in human hepatocellular carcinoma
  HCC using a mouse hepatoblast model and identified 18 tumor-promoting genes, including
  CCND1 and its neighbor on 11q13.3, FGF19. Although it is widely assumed that CCND1
  is the main driving oncogene of this common amplicon 15 frequency in HCC , both
  forward-transformation assays and RNAi-mediated inhibition in human HCC cells established
  that FGF19 is an equally important driver gene in HCC. Furthermore, clonal growth
  and tumorigenicity of HCC cells harboring the 11q13.3 amplicon were selectively
  inhibited by RNAi-mediated knockdown of CCND1 or FGF19, as well as by an anti-FGF19
  antibody. These results show that 11q13.3 amplification could be an effective biomarker
  for patients most likely to respond to anti-FGF19 therapy.
