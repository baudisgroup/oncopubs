abstract: Many common human mesenchymal tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal
  tumor GIST , rhabdomyosarcoma RMS and leiomyosarcoma LMS , feature myogenic differentiation.
  Here we report that intragenic deletion of the dystrophin-encoding and muscular
  dystrophy-associated DMD gene is a frequent mechanism by which myogenic tumors progress
  to high-grade, lethal sarcomas. Dystrophin is expressed in the non-neoplastic and
  benign counterparts of GIST, RMS and LMS tumors, and DMD deletions inactivate larger
  dystrophin isoforms, including 427-kDa dystrophin, while preserving the expression
  of an essential 71-kDa isoform. Dystrophin inhibits myogenic sarcoma cell migration,
  invasion, anchorage independence and invadopodia formation, and dystrophin inactivation
  was found in 96 , 100 and 62 of metastatic GIST, embryonal RMS and LMS samples,
  respectively. These findings validate dystrophin as a tumor suppressor and likely
  anti-metastatic factor, suggesting that therapies in development for muscular dystrophies
  may also have relevance in the treatment of cancer.
