abstract: The available evidence suggests that the lethality of glioblastoma is driven
  by small subpopulations of cells that self-renew and exhibit tumorigenicity. It
  remains unclear whether tumorigenicity exists as a static property of a few cells
  or as a dynamically acquired property. We used tumor-sphere and xenograft formation
  as assays for tumorigenicity and examined subclones isolated from established and
  primary glioblastoma lines. Our results indicate that glioblastoma tumorigenicity
  is largely deterministic, yet the property can be acquired spontaneously at low
  frequencies. Further, these dynamic transitions are governed by epigenetic reprogramming
  through the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD depletion increases trimethylation
  of histone 3 lysine 4 at the avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC)
  locus, which elevates MYC expression. MYC, in turn, regulates oligodendrocyte lineage
  transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2), and
  POU class 3 homeobox 2 (POU3F2), a core set of transcription factors required for
  reprogramming glioblastoma cells into stem-like states. Our model suggests epigenetic
  regulation of key transcription factors governs transitions between tumorigenic
  states and provides a framework for glioblastoma therapeutic development.
