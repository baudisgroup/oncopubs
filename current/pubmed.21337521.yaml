abstract: The telomeric amplicon at 8p12 is common in oestrogen receptor-positive
  ER breast cancers. Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 primary breast tumours
  revealed that ZNF703 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was amplified
  predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to correlate with
  increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a distinct expression
  signature and poor clinical outcome. ZNF703 transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, behaving
  as a classical oncogene, and regulated proliferation in human luminal breast cancer
  cell lines and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. Manipulation of ZNF703
  expression in the luminal MCF7 cell line modified the effects of TGF on proliferation.
  Overexpression of ZNF703 in normal human breast epithelial cells enhanced the frequency
  of in vitro colony-forming cells from luminal progenitors. Taken together, these
  data strongly point to ZNF703 as a novel oncogene in Luminal B breast cancer.
