abstract: Chromosomal abnormalities are important in the diagnosis and prognosis of
  patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML . The purpose of this study was to identify
  DNA copy number variations in karyotypically normal AML patients and their correlation
  with immunophenotypes. Conventional comparative genomic hybridization CGH and immunophenotyping
  were performed in 46 untreated AML patients aged 7-68 years. Among the 86 Indian
  patients who had AML, 40 46.5 showed an abnormal karyotype and 46 53.4 showed no
  chromosome aberrations. The karyotypically abnormal AML patients were excluded from
  the study. Out of the 46 patients without chromosomal aberrations, 24 52.2 showed
  DNA copy number variations including losses and gains. The DNA copy number variations
  involved chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 16, 17 gains and 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10,
  11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21 losses . The aberrant immunophenotype was noticed in 13 of
  these 24 54 cases. The hidden chromosome rearrangements in karyotypically normal
  AML, which could not be detected by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in
  situ hybridization, were detected by CGH. These genetic changes have an important
  role in the prognosis of the disease. The DNA copy number changes might also be
  involved in the aberrant immunophenotypes in our study.
