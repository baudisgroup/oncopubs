abstract: Adverse soft tissue reactions in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip
  replacement are associated with cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) particles released
  from the implant. Exposing the patients to long periods of increased metal ions
  concentrations resulting from the wear of these implants poses an increased risk
  of genotoxicity/mutagenicity. A variable proportion of patients develop periprosthetic
  soft-tissue masses or pseudotumors at the site of the implant. There is a concern
  that exposure to increased metal ions could increase the risk of cancer. In order
  to investigate whether the periprosthetic soft-tissue mass harbours any cancer-
  related genetic alterations, we studied DNA isolated from periprosthetic tissues
  of 20 patients with MoM hip replacement, for copy number alterations and mutations
  in hotspot regions of 50 cancer genes using aCGH and amplicon-based next generation
  sequencing. Our results showed copy number gains at 12q14.3 and 21q21.1in tumour
  from patient diagnosed with liposarcoma. Copy number alterations in periprosthetic
  tissues were seen in three other patients, one had a region of gain at 9q24.1 affecting
  JAK2 and INSL6, and two patients had region of gain at 6p21.1, affecting RUNX2.
  Mutation analysis showed V1578del mutation in NOTCH1 in two patients. The copy number
  alterations and mutations seen in periprosthetic soft-tissue masses are earlier
  reported in either haematological malignancies or in osteoblast related bone dysplasia.
  The presence of genetic anomalies was associated with longer in-situ time of the
  implant. Our findings warrant the need of similar studies in larger patient cohorts
  to evaluate the risk of development of neoplastic alterations in periprosthetic
  tissues of patients with MoM hip replacement.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier B.V.
