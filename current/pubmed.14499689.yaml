abstract: Desmoid tumors are benign neoplasms of the fibromatosis group. Data on their
  acquired chromosomal changes are sparse and, therefore, we wanted to ascertain what
  genomic losses and gains these tumors may have incurred. DNA was extracted from
  a total of 26 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded desmoid tumors followed by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization I-FISH
  analyses. Ten of 12 informative tumors were normal by CGH the two abnormal ones
  had loss of chromosome 6 and loss of 6q and gain of chromosome 20, respectively.
  I-FISH analyses with an alpha-satellite probe specific for chromosome 8 of 26 desmoids,
  including one tumor that by karyotyping had i 8 q10 , showed no evident abnormalities.
  An explanation for the relatively high frequency of genomically normal tumors by
  CGH seen in this study may be sought in the fact that as many as 10 of the 12 informative
  tumors were abdominal desmoids, a subset of tumors also previously found to exhibit
  genomic changes only rarely. It is therefore possible that abdominal desmoids might
  be non-neoplastic tumors or neoplastic tumors with genetic changes too small to
  be discovered by CGH, whereas desmoid tumors from other locations exhibit detectable
  genomic changes at a significantly higher frequency.
