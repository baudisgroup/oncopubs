abstract: We performed a comparative genomic hybridization study on 25 lung adenocarcinoma
  samples from younger patients amp lt 41 y of age and compared the results with a
  previous comparative genomic hybridization analysis of lung adenocarcinoma samples
  from older patients 50-81 y of age . Twenty of the 25 tumor samples from younger
  patients had DNA copy number changes. Gains, losses, and high-level amplifications
  were seen more frequently in the specimens from the younger group. The most striking
  difference between the two groups was the high frequency of gains and or high-level
  amplifications in the long arm of chromosome 20 in the samples from the younger
  patients 14 25, 56 compared with that in the samples from the older patients 2 24,
  8 , P amp lt .001 . Gains in the long arm of chromosome 22 and of the chromosomal
  band 11q13 were also detected significantly more often in the younger group. No
  correlation was found between DNA copy number changes and clinical parameters. Our
  results suggest that amplification of genes in the long arm of chromosome 20 may
  be important in the tumorigenesis of lung adenocarcinoma in young adults. Several
  candidate genes have already been described in the long arm of chromosome 20, particularly
  in breast cancer.
