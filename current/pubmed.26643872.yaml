abstract: Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma accounting
  for 20% of all adult sarcomas. Due to absence of clinically effective treatment
  options in inoperable situations and resistance to chemotherapeutics, a critical
  need exists to identify novel therapeutic targets. We analyzed LPS genomic landscape
  using SNP arrays, whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing to uncover
  the genomic information for development of specific anti-cancer targets. SNP array
  analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel
  genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R). Carboxypeptidase M (CPM),
  recurrently amplified gene in well-differentiated/de-differentiated LPS was noted
  as a putative oncogene involved in the EGFR pathway. Notable deletions were found
  at chromosome 1p (RUNX3, ARID1A), chromosome 11q (ATM, CHEK1) and chromosome 13q14.2
  (MIR15A, MIR16-1). Significantly and recurrently mutated genes (false discovery
  rate < 0.05) included PLEC (27%), MXRA5 (21%), FAT3 (24%), NF1 (20%), MDC1 (10%),
  TP53 (7%) and CHEK2 (6%). Further, in vitro and in vivo functional studies provided
  evidence for the tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in different
  subtypes of LPS. Pathway analysis of recurrent mutations demonstrated signaling
  through MAPK, JAK-STAT, Wnt, ErbB, axon guidance, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and
  cell cycle pathways were involved in liposarcomagenesis. Interestingly, we also
  found mutational and copy number heterogeneity within a primary LPS tumor signifying
  the importance of multi-region sequencing for cancer-genome guided therapy. In summary,
  these findings provide insight into the genomic complexity of LPS and highlight
  potential druggable pathways for targeted therapeutic approach.
