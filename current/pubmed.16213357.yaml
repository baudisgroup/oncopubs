abstract: The t 14 18 q32.3 q21 , hallmark of follicular lymphoma FL , is less frequently
  observed in Asian patients than in Westerners. Little is known about additional
  chromosomal aberrations in Asian FL patients. We applied comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to screen for genomic imbalances in 32 biopsy samples from 23 Japanese patients
  with nodal FL. The t 14 18 was assessed with polymerase chain reaction PCR using
  primers for the major MBR , 3MBR, minor mcr , 5mcr, and intermediate breakpoint
  cluster regions icr . In 17 of 23 patients, CGH analyses detected genomic imbalances.
  Gains frequently affected chromosomes 18p 6 of 23 , X 5 of 23 , 5 4 of 23 , 12 4
  of 23 , 2 3 of 23 , and 16 3 of 23 . The only recurrent loss affected chromosome
  6q 2 of 23 . A t 14 18 was detected in 13 of 23 patients 56.5 . Breakpoints were
  located in the MBR 10 patients , in the 3MBR, in the mcr, and in the icr 1 patient
  each . The frequency of aberrations detected by CGH as well as relapse-free survival
  were not distinctly different between patients with and without a t 14 18 . In summary,
  no significant difference in the overall frequency of aberrations compared with
  Westerners was found. Despite the extended primer set used, the frequency of PCR-detected
  t 14 18 remained low. Additional studies are required to assess the reasons for
  geographic variation in FL.
