abstract: 'Tumor samples of 53 patients with t 11 14 -positive mantle cell lymphomas
  MCLs were analyzed by matrix-based comparative genomic hybridization matrix-CGH
  using a dedicated DNA array. In 49 cases, genomic aberrations were identified. In
  comparison to chromosomal CGH, a 50 higher number of aberrations was found and the
  high specificity of matrix-CGH was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH analyses. The 11q gains and 13q34 deletions, which have not been described
  as frequent genomic aberrations in MCL, were identified by matrix-CGH in 15 and
  26 cases, respectively. For several genomic aberrations, novel consensus regions
  were defined: 8p21 size of the consensus region, 2.4 megabase pairs Mbp candidate
  genes: TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF10C, TNFRSF10D 10p13 2.7 Mbp BMI1 11q13 1.4 Mbp RELA 11q13
  5.2 Mbp CCND1 13q14 0.4 Mbp RFP2, BCMSUN and 13q34 6.9 Mbp . In univariate analyses
  correlating genomic aberrations and clinical course, 8p- and 13q14- deletions were
  associated with an inferior overall survival. These data provide a basis for further
  studies focusing on the identification of pathogenetically or clinically relevant
  genes in MCL.'
