abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Gastric cancer is a major gastrointestinal malignancy for which
  targeted therapies are emerging as treatment options. This study sought to identify
  the most prevalent molecular targets in gastric cancer and to elucidate systematic
  patterns of exclusivity and co-occurrence among these targets, through comprehensive
  genomic analysis of a large panel of gastric cancers. DESIGN: Using high-resolution
  single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, copy number alterations were profiled in
  a panel of 233 gastric cancers 193 primary tumours, 40 cell lines and 98 primary
  matched gastric non-malignant samples. For selected alterations, their impact on
  gene expression and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: 22 recurrent focal
  alterations 13 amplifications and nine deletions were identified. These included
  both known targets FGFR2, ERBB2 and also novel genes in gastric cancer KLF5, GATA6
  . Receptor tyrosine kinase RTK RAS alterations were found to be frequent in gastric
  cancer. This study also demonstrates, for the first time, that these alterations
  occur in a mutually exclusive fashion, with KRAS gene amplifications highlighting
  a clinically relevant but previously underappreciated gastric cancer subgroup. FGFR2-amplified
  gastric cancers were also shown to be sensitive to dovitinib, an orally bioavailable
  FGFR VEGFR targeting agent, potentially representing a subtype-specific therapy
  for FGFR2-amplified gastric cancers. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the existence
  of five distinct gastric cancer patient subgroups, defined by the signature genomic
  alterations FGFR2 9 of tumours , KRAS 9 , EGFR 8 , ERBB2 7 and MET 4 . Collectively,
  these subgroups suggest that at least 37 of gastric cancer patients may be potentially
  treatable by RTK RAS directed therapies.'
