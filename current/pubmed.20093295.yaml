abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia with an isodicentric
  X chromosome idic X q13 occur in elderly women and frequently display ringed sideroblasts.
  Because of the rarity of idic X q13 , little is known about its formation, whether
  a fusion gene is generated, and patterns of additional aberrations. We here present
  an SNP array study of 14 idic X -positive myeloid malignancies, collected through
  an international collaborative effort. The breakpoints clustered in two regions
  of segmental duplications and were not in a gene, making dosage effects from the
  concurrent gain of Xpter-q13 and loss of Xq13-qter, rather than a fusion gene, the
  most likely pathogenetic outcome. Methylation analysis revealed involvement of the
  inactive X chromosomes in five cases and of the active in two. The ABCB7 gene, mutated
  in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and spinocerebellar ataxia, is in the deleted region,
  suggesting that loss of this gene underlies the frequent presence of ringed sideroblasts.
  Additional genetic abnormalities were present in 12 14 86 , including partial uniparental
  disomies for 9p one case and 4q two cases associated with homozygous mutations of
  JAK2 and TET2, respectively. In total, TET2 mutations were seen in 4 11 36 analyzed
  cases, thus constituting a common secondary event in idic X -positive malignancies.
