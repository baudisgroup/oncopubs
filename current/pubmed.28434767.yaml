abstract: Infants with an immobile arm may be easily overlooked in primary care settings.
  Differential diagnoses include injuries, infections, neuropathies, ischemia and
  rarely, neoplasms. We report the case of a one-year-old boy with weakness in his
  left arm after minor trauma with a diagnosis of brachial plexus palsy initially.
  After rehabilitation for 2months, his weakness progressed to unsteady gait and quadriparesis.
  MRI revealed a huge solid tumor in the left supraclavicular fossa, which also involved
  the left brachial plexus, upper thoracic cavity, and left paravertebral space with
  invasion into the spinal canal. Microscopically, the medium-large polygonal tumor
  cells had an eccentric eosinophilic cytoplasm and immunostaining showed a loss of
  nuclear INI1 expression. Array comparative genomic hybridization of the tumor tissue
  confirmed a segmental deletion at chromosome region 22q11.23 involving the SMARCB1
  gene. The final diagnosis was cervical paravertebral malignant rhabdoid tumor with
  intraspinal epidural and intradural invasion, a rare case of extrarenal extracranial
  rhabdoid tumor (ERRT). The intraspinal part of the tumor was resected followed by
  interval-compressed chemotherapy with vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide alternating
  with ifosfamide-etoposide (VDC/IE). The tumor showed very good partial response
  to four cycles of chemotherapy with gradual recovery of neurological symptoms. ERRT
  is a very rare and aggressive tumor that mainly occurs in infants and children and
  may manifest with vague neurological symptoms when it involves the spinal cord and/or
  peripheral nerves. A neoplasm such as ERRT originating from or involving the brachial
  plexus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an immobile arm in
  infancy.
