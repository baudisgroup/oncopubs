abstract: Genomic rearrangements are thought to occur progressively during tumor development.
  Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving massive chromosome
  rearrangements in a one-step catastrophic event termed chromothripsis. We report
  the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma SHH-MB
  brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation Li-Fraumeni syndrome ,
  uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with
  microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients
  reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs.
  Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation
  and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic
  DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic
  TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia. These findings connect
  p53 status and chromothripsis in specific tumor types, providing a genetic basis
  for understanding particularly aggressive subtypes of cancer.
