abstract: Gastric carcinogenesis is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection,
  but the underlying genetic mechanisms are largely unknown. The aim of this study
  was to correlate chromosomal aberrations in gastric cancer to H. pylori status and
  its different strains, as well as to histological type and other clinico-pathological
  variables. DNA from 46 gastric cancers male female 35 11, age 27-85 years was extracted
  from formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded material and tested for chromosomal gains
  and losses by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Chromosomal aberrations with
  frequencies of 20 or higher were considered to be non-random changes associated
  with gastric cancer. The mean number of chromosomal events per tumour was 9.7 range
  0-27 , with a mean of 3.2 gains range 0-16 and 6.5 losses range 0-15 . Gains were
  most frequently found at chromosomes 8q and 13q 24 and 26 , respectively . Losses
  were predominantly found on chromosome arms 2q, 9p, 12q, 14q, 15q, 16p, 16q, 17p,
  17q, 19p, 19q, and 22q 22 , 30 , 43 , 22 , 33 , 50 , 28 , 50 , 39 , 33 , 39 , and
  37 , respectively . Common regions of overlap narrowed down to 2q11-14, 8q23, 9p21,
  12q24, 13q21-22, 14q24 and 15q11-15. The mean number of gains was higher in tumours
  with metastases than in localized tumours 4.1 vs. 1.9, p 0.04 . Tumours with a loss
  at 17p showed a higher number of losses than tumours without a 17p loss 9. 5 vs.
  4.7 on average, p amp lt 0.001 . Neither H. pylori status , n 25 -, n 21 nor H.
  pylori strain was correlated to the total number of events or to any specific chromosomal
  aberration, nor were there differences between intestinal n 30 and diffuse n 15
  cancers or any other clinico-pathological variable tested. In conclusion, a complex
  of chromosomal aberrations is involved in gastric cancer, but their pattern does
  not depend on H. pylori status or strain, nor on the histological type of the tumour.
  The exact biological meaning of these aberrations in carcinogenesis needs further
  clarification.
