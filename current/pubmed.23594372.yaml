abstract: Copy number alterations are frequently found in colorectal cancer CRC ,
  and recurrent gains or losses are likely to correspond to regions harbouring genes
  that promote or impede carcinogenesis respectively. Gain of chromosome 13q is common
  in CRC but, because the region of gain is frequently large, identification of the
  driver gene s has hitherto proved difficult. We used array comparative genomic hybridization
  to analyse 124 primary CRCs, demonstrating that 13q34 is a region of gain in 35
  of CRCs, with focal gains in 4 and amplification in a further 1.6 of cases. To reduce
  the number of potential driver genes to consider, it was necessary to refine the
  boundaries of the narrowest copy number changes seen in this series and hence define
  the minimal copy region MCR . This was performed using molecular copy-number counting,
  identifying IRS2 as the only complete gene, and therefore the likely driver oncogene,
  within the refined MCR. Analysis of available colorectal neoplasia data sets confirmed
  IRS2 gene gain as a common event. Furthermore, IRS2 protein and mRNA expression
  in colorectal neoplasia was assessed and was positively correlated with progression
  from normal through adenoma to carcinoma. In functional in vitro experiments, we
  demonstrate that deregulated expression of IRS2 activates the oncogenic PI3 kinase
  pathway and increases cell adhesion, both characteristics of invasive CRC cells.
  Together, these data identify IRS2 as a likely driver oncogene in the prevalent
  13q34 region of gain amplification and suggest that IRS2 over-expression may provide
  an additional mechanism of PI3 kinase pathway activation in CRC.
