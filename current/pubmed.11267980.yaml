abstract: We have studied the occurrence and association of 11q deletions with other
  chromosomal imbalances in Stage 4 neuroblastomas. To this purpose we have performed
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis on 50 Stage 4 neuroblastomas and
  these data were analyzed together with those from 33 previously published cases.
  We observed a high incidence of 11q deletion in Stage 4 neuroblastoma without MYCN
  amplification 59 whereas 11q loss was only observed in 15 of neuroblastomas with
  MYCN-amplification p 0.0002 or 11 of cases with 1p deletion detected by CGH p 0.0001
  . In addition, 11q loss showed significant positive correlation with 3p loss p 0.0002
  . Event-free survival was poor and not significantly different for patients with
  or without 11q deletion. Our study provides further evidence that Stage 4 neuroblastomas
  with 11q deletions represent a distinct genetic subgroup that typically shows no
  MYCN-amplification nor 1p deletion. Moreover, it shows that neuroblastomas with
  11q deletion also often present 3p deletion. This genetic subgroup shows a similar
  poor prognosis as MYCN amplified 4 neuroblastomas.
