abstract: Inactivation of the CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus has been reported in the most frequent
  subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas CTCLs , mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome
  SS and CD30 cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. To investigate whether genetic
  or epigenetic inactivation of CDKN2A-CDKN2B is more specifically observed in certain
  CTCL subtypes with clinical impact, we used array-comparative genomic hybridization,
  quantitative PCR, interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization and methylation analyses
  of p14 ARF p16 INK4A and p15 INK4B promoters. We studied 67 samples from 58 patients
  with either transformed mycosis fungoides n 24 , SS n 16 or CD30 cutaneous anaplastic
  large cell lymphoma n 18 . We observed combined CDKN2A-CDKN2B deletion in both transformed
  mycosis fungoides n 17, 71 and SS patients n 7, 44 , but, surprisingly, in only
  one CD30 cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma case. Interphase fluorescent in
  situ hybridization showed 9p21 loss in 17 out of 19 cases, with 9p21 deletion indicating
  either hemizygous n 4 or homozygous n 2 deletion, with mixed patterns in most patients
  n 11 . The limited size of 9p21 deletion was found to account for false-negative
  detection by either BAC arrays n 9 or fluorescent in situ hybridization n 2 , especially
  in patients with Sezary syndrome n 6 . Methylation was found to be restricted to
  the p15 INK4B gene promoter in patients with or without 9p21 deletion and did not
  correlate with prognosis. In contrast, CDKN2A-CDKN2B genetic loss was strongly associated
  with a shorter survival in CTCL patients P 0.002 and more specifically at 24 months
  in transformed mycosis fungoides and SS patients P 0.02 . As immunohistochemistry
  for p16 INK4A protein was not found to be informative, the genetic status of the
  CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus would be relevant in assessing patients with epidermotropic
  CTCLs in order to identify those cases where the disease was more aggressive.
