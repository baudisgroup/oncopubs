abstract: We have sequenced 463 presenting cases of myeloma entered into the UK Myeloma
  XI study using whole exome sequencing. Here we identify mutations induced as a consequence
  of misdirected AID in the partner oncogenes of IGH translocations, which are activating
  and associated with impaired clinical outcome. An APOBEC mutational signature is
  seen in 3.8% of cases and is linked to the translocation-mediated deregulation of
  MAF and MAFB, a known poor prognostic factor. Patients with this signature have
  an increased mutational load and a poor prognosis. Loss of MAF or MAFB expression
  results in decreased APOBEC3B and APOBEC4 expression, indicating a transcriptional
  control mechanism. Kataegis, a further mutational pattern associated with APOBEC
  deregulation, is seen at the sites of the MYC translocation. The APOBEC mutational
  signature seen in myeloma is, therefore, associated with poor prognosis primary
  and secondary translocations and the molecular mechanisms involved in generating
  them.
