abstract: "Patients with breast cancer have an increased risk of developing subsequent
  breast cancers. It is important to distinguish whether these tumours are de novo
  or recurrences of the primary tumour in order to guide the appropriate therapy.
  Our aim was to investigate the use of DNA methylation profiling and array comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine whether the second tumour is clonally
  related to the first tumour.  Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting was
  used to screen promoter methylation in a panel of 13 genes reported as methylated
  in breast cancer (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, CDH13, RARÎ², BRCA1, CDH1,
  CDKN2A, TP73, and GSTP1) in 29 tumour pairs (16 ipsilateral and 13 contralateral).
  Using the methylation profile of these genes, we employed a Bayesian and an empirical
  statistical approach to estimate clonal relationship. Copy number alterations were
  analysed using aCGH on the same set of tumour pairs.  There is a higher probability
  of the second tumour being recurrent in ipsilateral tumours compared with contralateral
  tumours (38Â % versus 8Â %; pâ\x80\x89<0.05) based on the methylation profile. Using
  previously reported recurrence rates as Bayesian prior probabilities, we classified
  69Â % of ipsilateral and 15Â % of contralateral tumours as recurrent. The inferred
  clonal relationship results of the tumour pairs were generally concordant between
  methylation profiling and aCGH.  Our results show that DNA methylation profiling
  as well as aCGH have potential as diagnostic tools in improving the clinical decisions
  to differentiate recurrences from a second de novo tumour."
