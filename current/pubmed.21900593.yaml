abstract: Cetuximab, an antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor,
  is an effective clinical therapy for patients with colorectal, head and neck, and
  non-small cell lung cancer, particularly for those with KRAS and BRAF wild-type
  cancers. Treatment in all patients is limited eventually by the development of acquired
  resistance, but little is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we show that
  activation of ERBB2 signaling in cell lines, either through ERBB2 amplification
  or through heregulin up-regulation, leads to persistent extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1 2 signaling and consequently to cetuximab resistance. Inhibition of ERBB2
  or disruption of ERBB2 ERBB3 heterodimerization restores cetuximab sensitivity in
  vitro and in vivo. A subset of colorectal cancer patients who exhibit either de
  novo or acquired resistance to cetuximab-based therapy has ERBB2 amplification or
  high levels of circulating heregulin. Collectively, these findings identify two
  distinct resistance mechanisms, both of which promote aberrant ERBB2 signaling,
  that mediate cetuximab resistance. Moreover, these results suggest that ERBB2 inhibitors,
  in combination with cetuximab, represent a rational therapeutic strategy that should
  be assessed in patients with cetuximab-resistant cancers.
