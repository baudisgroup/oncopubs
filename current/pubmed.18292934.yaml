abstract: Neuroblastomas are biologically and clinically heterogeneous tumours that
  most often occur sporadically in children at median age of 2 years. The PHOX2B gene
  is implicated in the development of the autonomic nervous system and has been found
  to be infrequently mutated in sporadic neuroblastoma tumours and in some patients
  with hereditary neuroblastoma. We have screened a selected series of 36 paediatric
  tumours with presumed genetic predisposition, 34 of them neuroblastomas, for mutations
  in PHOX2B. A constitutional heterozygous missense mutation was found in a boy who
  developed bilateral adrenal tumours and stage 4 disease during infancy. The second
  allele of the PHOX2B locus was lost in the tumour DNA. Histopathological evaluation
  of the tumours suggested growth of two primary tumours, one with diploid DNA content
  and the other with tetraploid DNA content, i.e. a case of neuroblastoma stage 4M
  multifocal tumour . However, array CGH comparative genomic hybridization data performed
  on both tumour masses from the patient instead supported a model where a common
  malignant precursor gave rise to the diploid tumour and subsequently the tetraploid
  tumour have progressed from the common precursor or by metastasis from the diploid
  tumour with additional genetic changes. The whole genome dosage analysis showed
  that the remaining alleles of PHOX2B had been lost in both tumours together with
  a specific 17q gain pattern. The tetraploid tumour had these features together with
  additional whole chromosomal loss of chromosomes 3, 9, 14 and 15. Based on the data
  presented here we suggest that loss of PHOX2B and 17q gain are early events in neuroblastoma
  tumourigenesis. We also propose investigators to re-analyze the rare cases of multifocal
  neuroblastomas with the array CGH technique for better understanding of the origin
  of these tumours.
