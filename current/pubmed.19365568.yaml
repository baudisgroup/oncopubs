abstract: Although paediatric high grade gliomas resemble their adult counterparts
  in many ways, there appear to be distinct clinical and biological differences. One
  important factor hampering the development of new targeted therapies is the relative
  lack of cell lines derived from childhood glioma patients, as it is unclear whether
  the well-established adult lines commonly used are representative of the underlying
  molecular genetics of childhood tumours. We have carried out a detailed molecular
  and phenotypic characterisation of a series of paediatric high grade glioma cell
  lines in comparison to routinely used adult lines.
