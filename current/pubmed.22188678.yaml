abstract: In a cancer cell the number of copies of a locus may vary due to amplification
  and deletion and these variations are denoted as copy number alterations CNAs .
  We focus on the disparity of CNAs in tumour samples, which were compared to those
  in blood in order to identify the directional loss of heterozygosity.
