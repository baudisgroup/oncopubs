abstract: Carcinoma of uterine cervix is the second most common cancers among women
  worldwide. Combined radiation and chemotherapy is the choice of treatment for advanced
  stages of the disease. The prognosis is poor, with a five-year survival rate ranging
  from about 20-65 , depending on stage of the disease. Therefore, genetic characterization
  is essential for understanding the biology and clinical heterogeneity in cervical
  cancer CC .
