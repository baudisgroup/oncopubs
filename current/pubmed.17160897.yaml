abstract: Segmental copy-number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are associated
  with developmental disorders and susceptibility to diseases. More importantly, CNVs
  may represent a major genetic component of our phenotypic diversity. In this study,
  using a whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization assay, we identified
  3,654 autosomal segmental CNVs, 800 of which appeared at a frequency of at least
  3%. Of these frequent CNVs, 77% are novel. In the 95 individuals analyzed, the two
  most diverse genomes differed by at least 9 Mb in size or varied by at least 266
  loci in content. Approximately 68% of the 800 polymorphic regions overlap with genes,
  which may reflect human diversity in senses (smell, hearing, taste, and sight),
  rhesus phenotype, metabolism, and disease susceptibility. Intriguingly, 14 polymorphic
  regions harbor 21 of the known human microRNAs, raising the possibility of the contribution
  of microRNAs to phenotypic diversity in humans. This in-depth survey of CNVs across
  the human genome provides a valuable baseline for studies involving human genetics.
