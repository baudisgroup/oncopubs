abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to screen 83 lung adenocarcinomas
  of 60 patients for chromosomal imbalances. The most common alteration was DNA overrepresentation
  on chromosome 1q, with a peak incidence at 1q22-q23 in 73 of the primary tumours,
  followed by DNA overrepresentation on chromosomes 8q and 20q, and deletions on chromosomes
  3p, 4q, 6q, 9p, 9q, and 13q, in at least 60 . The generation of a difference histogram
  of metastasizing versus non-metastasizing tumours and a case-by-case histogram for
  the comparison of 23 paired samples of primary tumours and corresponding metastases
  suggested that deletions on chromosomes 3p12-p14, 3p22-p24, 4p13-15.1, 4q21-qter,
  6q21-qter, 8p, 10q, 14q21, 17p12-p13, 20p12, and 21q, and overrepresentations on
  chromosomes 1q21-q25, 7q11.2, 9q34, 11q12-q13, 14q11-q13, and 17q25 are associated
  with the metastatic phenotype. In contrast, losses on chromosome 19 and gains on
  3p, 4q, 5p, and 6q were preferentially found in non-metastasizing tumours. The analysis
  of the paired samples revealed considerable chromosomal instability, but indicated
  a clonal relationship in each case. The primary tumours often showed additional
  deletions, suggesting that loss of function mutations are critical in the initial
  phase of tumour dissemination, whereas the metastases preferentially acquired DNA
  gains, probably modulating the metastatic phenotype. The primary data from this
  study ratio profiles, clinicopathological parameters, histograms are also available
  at http: amba.charite.de cgh.'
