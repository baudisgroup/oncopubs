abstract: A case of acute myeloid leukemia M-3 with complex karyotypic aberrations
  and double minute dmin chromosomes is presented. The patient had no history of prior
  exposure to mutagenic or carcinogenic agents or of other malignancies. She died
  from CNS involvement six weeks after the initial diagnosis. We used comparative
  genomic hybridization to identify the amplified sequences presumed to represent
  the dmin of the leukemic cells the tumor normal ratios indicated increased signal
  intensity at 8q24. This localization prompted investigation by semi-quantitative
  PCR that revealed amplification of the MYC oncogene. The extent of chromosome aberrations
  and the oncogene amplification, both linked with poor prognosis, may relate to the
  rapid course of this patients disease.
