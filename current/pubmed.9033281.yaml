abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was used to search for previously unknown
  gains and losses of DNA sequences along all chromosome arms in 29 chondrosarcoma
  specimens obtained from 23 patients. Extensive genetic aberrations, with a mean
  of 6 changes per tumor range, 1 to 24 , were detected in 21 of the 29 samples analyzed
  72 . The majority of these changes were gains of whole chromosomes or whole chromosome
  arms. Gains of DNA sequence copy number were most frequent at 20q 38 , 17p 38 ,
  20p 31 , 1cen-q24 28 , and 14q23-qter 28 . High-level amplifications of small chromosome
  regions were sporadic, detected in only 17 of the samples. The only recurrent high-level
  amplification, seen in two tumors 7 , affected the minimal common region 12cen-q15.
  Other amplifications, each encountered only once, involved 1p33-p35, 2p23-pter,
  4p, 6p22-pter, 18q12-q22, 19p13.2, 19q13.2, and 20q13.1. Losses of DNA sequences
  were rare and were most commonly observed at 6cen-q22 17 and 9p 17 .
