abstract: This study was aimed at understanding the functional and clinicopathological
  significance of MAPK15 alteration in gastric cancer. Genome-wide copy number alterations
  (CNAs) were first investigated in 40 gastric cancers using Agilent aCGH-244K or
  aCGH-400K, and copy number gains of MAPK15 found in aCGH were validated in another
  set of 48 gastric cancer tissues. The expression of MAPK15 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry
  in concurrent lesions of normal, adenoma, and carcinoma from additional 45 gastric
  cancer patients. The effects of MAPK15 on cell cycle, c-Jun phosphorylation, and
  mRNA stability were analyzed in gastric cancer cells. Copy number gains of MAPK15
  were found in 15 (17%) of 88 tumor tissues. The mRNA levels of MAPK15 were relatively
  high in the gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer cells with higher copy number
  gains than those without. Knockdown of MAPK15 using siRNA in gastric cancer cells
  significantly suppressed cell proliferation and resulted in cell cycle arrest at
  G1-S phase. Reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and c-Jun half-life were observed in MAPK15-knockdowned
  cells. In addition, transient transfection of MAPK15 into AGS gastric cancer cells
  with low copy number resulted in an increase of c-Jun phosphorylation and stability.
  The overexpression of MAPK15 occurred at a high frequency in carcinomas (37%) compared
  to concurrent normal tissues (2%) and adenomas (21%). In conclusion, the present
  study suggests that MAPK15 overexpression may contribute to the malignant transformation
  of gastric mucosa by prolonging the stability of c-Jun. And, patients with copy
  number gain of MAPK15 in normal or premalignant tissues of stomach may have a chance
  to progress to invasive cancer.
