abstract: The differentiation between malignant and benign adrenocortical tumors is
  often difficult, and better markers are required. Because the genetic background
  of adrenocortical tumors is poorly characterized, we used comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to screen for DNA sequence copy number changes in 8 sporadic primary adrenocortical
  cancers and 14 adenomas. There was a strong relationship between the number of genetic
  aberrations detected using CGH and both tumor size and malignancy. No alterations
  were seen in the smaller adenomas amp lt 5 cm , whereas the two largest adenomas
  5 cm each and seven of the eight cancers 7-20 cm showed an increased number of genetic
  alterations. The presence of genetic aberrations detected using CGH was associated
  with an aneuploid DNA pattern. In the cancers, losses most often involved the chromosomal
  regions 2, 11q, and 17p four of eight tumors , whereas gains took place at chromosomes
  4 and 5 four of eight tumors . In conclusion, our data indicate that genetic changes
  may help to define the malignant potential of adrenocortical tumors. Furthermore,
  the CGH results implicate several chromosomal regions that may contain genes with
  an important role in the development of adrenocortical cancers.
