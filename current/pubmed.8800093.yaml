abstract: The cellular origin of the sarcomatous component of gliosarcomas is controversial.
  It is not clear if the sarcoma arises in transition from the glial cells that comprise
  the gliomatous component or independently arises from non-neoplastic mesenchymal
  cells of the tumor stroma. Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH along with
  cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analysis, and polymerase
  chain reaction PCR analysis of microsatellite allelic imbalance, we have evaluated
  the genetic alterations in the gliomatous and sarcomatous components of five gliosarcomas.
  The glial element was grade 4 fibrillary astrocytoma glioblastoma multiforme in
  all five tumors. The sarcoma elements were fibroblastic without osseous, chondroid,
  or angiosarcomatous differentiation. Gain of chromosome 7, loss of chromosome 10,
  deletions of the chromosome 9 p-arm, and alterations of chromosome 3 were frequently
  observed, demonstrating that gliosarcomas can be genetically classified as belonging
  to the spectrum of glioblastomas. Furthermore, the sarcomatous and gliomatous portions
  of each gliosarcoma investigated were similar with respect to both the presence
  and absence of specific genetic alterations. This observation supports the hypothesis
  that the sarcomatous component of a gliosarcoma either arises from the same common
  precursor cell as the gliomatous portion, or it arises from the gliomatous portion
  itself.
