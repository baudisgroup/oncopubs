abstract: 'Very little is known concerning the cytogenetic and molecular genetic changes
  of low-grade central osteosarcoma, a rare form of osteosarcoma. In the present study,
  we used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to screen for DNA sequence copy number
  aberrations in 10 samples from 6 patients: 7 typical low-grade central osteosarcomas,
  one low-grade Grade II central osteosarcoma, and two high-grade III and IV local
  recurrences of a low-grade central osteosarcoma Nine samples had aberrations. Six
  typical low-grade central osteosarcoma samples had a single DNA sequence copy number
  change per tumor. Three samples from more advanced tumors a Grade II low-grade central
  osteosarcoma and local recurrences of Grade III and IV had a mean of five changes
  per tumor. Recurrent changes affected these minimal common regions: 12q13-q14 three
  tumors , 12p two tumors , and 6p21.1-p21.3 two tumors . Nine samples were analyzed
  for CDK4 and MDM2 expression and SAS amplification. One sample with a gain of chromosome
  12 had a very strong expression of MDM2, strong expression of CDK4, and amplification
  of SAS. One sample with a gain of 12q13-q14 had strong expression of CDK4 and MDM2.
  Strong expression of CDK4 was found in two additional tumors one had a gain of 12q13-q21,
  and the other had no changes in chromosome 12 by CGH. No alterations were detected
  in the CDK4, MDM2, and SAS panel in three other samples with no changes in chromosome
  12 by CGH. In conclusion, the low number of DNA sequence copy number alterations
  reflects the relatively low malignancy of low-grade central osteosarcoma. This simplicity
  differs from the complex aberrations seen in conventional high-grade osteosarcomas.'
