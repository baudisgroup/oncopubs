abstract: Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer FNMTC is associated with earlier onset
  and more aggressive behavior than its sporadic counterpart. Although candidate chromosomal
  loci have been proposed for isolated families with variants of FNMTC, the etiology
  of most cases is unknown. We aimed to identify loci linked to FNMTC susceptibility
  using single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP array-based linkage analysis in a broad
  sampling of affected families.
