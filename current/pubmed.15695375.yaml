abstract: Genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in 64 acute myeloid
  leukemias has revealed that approximately 20 exhibited large regions of homozygosity
  that could not be accounted for by visible chromosomal abnormalities in the karyotype.
  Further analysis confirmed that these patterns were due to partial uniparental disomy
  UPD . Remission bone marrow was available from five patients showing UPD in their
  leukemias, and in all cases the homozygosity was found to be restricted to the leukemic
  clone. Two examples of UPD11p were shown to be of different parental origin as indicated
  by the methylation pattern of the H19 gene. Furthermore, a previously identified
  homozygous mutation in the CEBPA gene coincided with a large-scale UPD on chromosome
  19. These cryptic chromosomal abnormalities, which seem to be nonrandom, have the
  characteristics of somatic recombination events and may define an important new
  subclass of leukemia.
