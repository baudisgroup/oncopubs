abstract: Primary fallopian tube carcinoma PFTC is a rare and highly aggressive tumor.
  Twelve cases of PFTC stages IA to IV were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization.
  The most consistent DNA gain was mapped to chromosome arm 3q in 11 of 12 cases.
  In six cases, the gain of 3q was present as a high level copy number increase amplification
  with a consensus region mapped to 3q26.2-qter. In the 12 cases, other frequent gains
  were located on chromosome arms 1q in 11 cases , 2q in 10 , 7q in 9 , 8q in 9 ,
  5p in 8 , 6p in 7 , 12p in 7 , and 14q in 6 . Frequent copy number losses occurred
  on chromosome arms 16q in 8 cases , 22q in7 , 6q in 6 . 8p in 6 , 18q in 6 , Xq
  in 6 , 1p in 5 , and 17p in 5 . All chromosomes were involved in chromosomal aberrations
  and the average number of copy alterations per case was 19.7. None of the 12 carcinomas
  revealed the presence of human papillomavirus HPV genomes. All of the cases exhibited
  crude aneuploidy. Strong p53 immunoreactivity could be observed in 10 of 12 cases
  while p21 WAF1 expression was low or undetectable. These results indicate that PFTC
  is a genomically highly unstable cancer, an observation that is in agreement with
  the poor prognosis associated with this tumor. A high frequency of 3q-gains has
  also been observed in HPV-related carcinomas of the uterine cervix. However, none
  of the PFTC was HPV related, suggesting that the 3q-gain is independent from HPV
  DNA.
