abstract: Single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays allow for genome-wide profiling of
  copy-number alterations and copy-neutral runs of homozygosity at high resolution.
  To identify novel genetic lesions in myeloproliferative neoplasms, a large series
  of 151 clinically well characterized patients was analyzed in our study. Copy-number
  alterations were rare in essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. In contrast,
  approximately one third of myelofibrosis patients exhibited small genomic losses
  less than 5 Mb . In 2 secondary myelofibrosis cases the tumor suppressor gene NF1
  in 17q11.2 was affected. Sequencing analyses revealed a mutation in the remaining
  NF1 allele of one patient. In terms of copy-neutral aberrations, no chromosomes
  other than 9p were recurrently affected. In conclusion, novel genomic aberrations
  were identified in our study, in particular in patients with myelofibrosis. Further
  analyses on single-gene level are necessary to uncover the mechanisms that are involved
  in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
