abstract: A comparative genomic hybridization CGH approach provides identification
  of genomic gains and losses in a tumor specimen in a single experiment. Only 11
  embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas E-RMS have previously been subjected to CGH. The underlying
  genetic events in this histologic subtype are not well defined. In this investigation,
  12 E-RMS specimens from 10 patients entered into Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study
  IRS I-IV and two local patients were analyzed by CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH . Gains of chromosomes or chromosomal regions 2 50 , 7 42 , 8 67 , 11 42 ,
  12 58 , 13q21 33 , and 20 33 and losses of 1p35-36.3 42 , 6 33 , 9q22 33 , 14q21-32
  25 , and 17 25 were most prominent. Chromosomal regions 1p35-36.3 and 9q22 represent
  novel regions of loss. Importantly, loss of 9q22 corresponds to the locus of a putative
  tumor suppressor gene PTCH , which has been shown to play a role in rhabdomyosarcoma
  in a mouse model of Gorlin syndrome. Loss of 1p36 corresponds to the locus for PAX7,
  a paired box containing gene characteristically altered in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.
  Moreover, loss of 1p36 is prominent in another common pediatric soft tissue tumor,
  neuroblastoma. Gains of 2, 7, 8, 12, and 13 and loss of 14 were seen in the sole
  prior E-RMS CGH series thus, these data provide important confirmatory results.
  In contrast to this previous study, however loss, not gain, of chromosome 17 was
  observed in the current study. Chromosome 17 loss correlates well with previous
  descriptions of frequent allelic loss of 17p TP53 in E-RMS. In summary, CGH and
  FISH analyses of 12 E-RMS specimens revealed novel genomic imbalances that may be
  useful in directing further molecular studies for the determination of E-RMS critically
  involved genes.
