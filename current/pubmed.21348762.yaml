abstract: Medulloblastoma MB is one of the most aggressive pediatric brain tumor.
  We report genome-wide pooled-analysis of classic MB variant of patients over 3 years
  of age at diagnosis. We combined array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH results
  from experimental analysis 31 cases with two public databases 55 cases in a final
  evaluation of 86 MBs. The most common chromosome structural aberrations were gains
  of 17q 45.3 , 1q 22.1 , and losses of 8p 15.1 , 10q 19.8 , 17p 37.2 , and 16q 16.3
  . Isochromome 17q was observed in 29.1 MBs. A significant association between poor
  patients survival and losses of 9q p amp lt 0.0023 , 10q p amp lt 0.012 , and 16q
  p amp lt 0.036 was observed. Univariate analysis showed association of 9q loss p
  amp lt 0.008 and 16q loss p  0.05 with adverse overall survival OS . Chromosome
  6 monosomy was a protective event although statistically borderline p  0.066 . After
  adjusting for confounding factors, a poor OS was found for patients whose tumor
  has 9q loss hazard ratio HR  3.97 p amp lt 0.006 or 16q loss HR  2.41 p  0.038 .
  Our results highlight the importance of genomic studies in different MB histological
  variants and indicate a genotype-phenotype correlation.
