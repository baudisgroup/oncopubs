abstract: Using high-resolution oligonucleotide comparative genomic hybridization
  arrays, we evaluated chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 breast cancers,
  selected on the basis of highly similar pathologic and molecular features characteristic
  of the amp quot basal-like amp quot phenotype. Each of these cancers showed numerous
  gains and losses, reflecting multiple chromosomal rearrangements during the development
  of these high-grade cancers. Chromosomal losses were particularly prevalent on chromosomal
  arms 5q, 8p, 9q, 12q, 17p, 19p, and Xq, and gains were commonly seen on chromosomal
  arms 1q, 8q, and 17q. The regions of high-level amplification copy number change
  more than eightfold on 4q12, 8q23.3, 19p12, and 19q13.2 were particularly remarkable.
  These regions included candidate oncogenes cKIT, JUND, and AKT2, and immunohistochemistry
  confirmed that these particular genes were highly expressed in the cancers harboring
  the specific amplifications. Each of these amplifications was observed only in individual
  cases, however, and no particular chromosomal alteration appeared to generally characterize
  this group of cancers. Thus, genomic changes among breast cancers with basal-like
  features appear to be very heterogeneous. Distinct high-level amplifications may
  provide new targets for treating some of these cancers, but copy number changes
  do not reveal a distinctive genomic fingerprint for this proposed class of breast
  cancers.
