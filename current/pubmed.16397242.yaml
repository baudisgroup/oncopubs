abstract: Spermatocytic seminomas are solid tumors found solely in the testis of predominantly
  elderly individuals. We investigated these tumors using a genome-wide analysis for
  structural and numerical chromosomal changes through conventional karyotyping, spectral
  karyotyping, and array comparative genomic hybridization using a 32 K genomic tiling-path
  resolution BAC platform confirmed by in situ hybridization . Our panel of five spermatocytic
  seminomas showed a specific pattern of chromosomal imbalances, mainly numerical
  in nature range, 3-24 per tumor . Gain of chromosome 9 was the only consistent anomaly,
  which in one case also involved amplification of the 9p21.3-pter region. Parallel
  chromosome level expression profiling as well as microarray expression analyses
  Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 was also done. Unsupervised cluster analysis showed that
  a profile containing transcriptional data on 373 genes difference of amp gt or 3.0-fold
  is suitable for distinguishing these tumors from seminomas dysgerminomas. The diagnostic
  markers SSX2-4 and POU5F1 OCT3 OCT4 , previously identified by us, were among the
  top discriminatory genes, thereby validating the experimental set-up. In addition,
  novel discriminatory markers suitable for diagnostic purposes were identified, including
  Deleted in Azospermia DAZ . Although the seminomas dysgerminomas were characterized
  by expression of stem cell-specific genes e.g., POU5F1, PROM1 CD133, and ZFP42 ,
  spermatocytic seminomas expressed multiple cancer testis antigens, including TSP50
  and CTCFL BORIS , as well as genes known to be expressed specifically during prophase
  meiosis I TCFL5, CLGN, and LDHc . This is consistent with different cells of origin,
  the primordial germ cell and primary spermatocyte, respectively. Based on the region
  of amplification defined on 9p and the associated expression plus confirmatory immunohistochemistry,
  DMRT1 a male-specific transcriptional regulator was identified as a likely candidate
  gene for involvement in the development of spermatocytic seminomas.
