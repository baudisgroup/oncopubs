abstract: We have analyzed 26 tumors from 12 patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Primary tumors and their lymph node metastases
  from five Dukes C patients as well as primary tumors and their liver metastases
  from seven Dukes D patients were used to assess the extent of genetic differences
  between primary and secondary colorectal carcinomas from the same patients, to calculate
  the degree of clonal divergence and genetic heterogeneity in metastatic colorectal
  cancer, and to determine the differences in genetic imbalances between Dukes C and
  D stage tumors. We show that the same genetic aberrations were frequently found
  in the primary tumors and their metastases. However, metastases often contained
  genetic aberrations not found in the corresponding primary tumors. The comparison
  of Dukes stages C and D revealed genetic aberrations common to both. However, reduced
  copy number of chromosome arm 17p 5 5 vs. 0 7 P 0.001 was significantly associated
  with Dukes stage C and lymph node metastases, while increased copy number of chromosome
  arms 6p 6 7 vs. 0 5 P 0.007 and 17q 5 7 vs. 0 5 P 0.027 was associated more with
  Dukes stage D and liver metastases. Our results established a repertoire of chromosomal
  alterations associated with metastatic colorectal cancer and suggest that Dukes
  C lymph node metastasis tumors are not always simply an earlier stage of Dukes D
  liver metastasis tumors and, thus, in some instances at least, they are distinct
  forms of the disease.
