abstract: To search for new copy number alterations CNAs in acute promyelocytic leukemia
  APL , we analyzed DNA from leukemic blasts of 93 acute promyelocytic leukemia APL
  patients with Genome-Wide SNP 6.0 arrays SNP-A . We identified 259 CNAs consisting
  of 170 heterozygous deletions, 82 amplifications, and 7 regions of copy number neutral
  loss of heterozygosity. One of the most common CNAs was a deletion on chromosomal
  subband 1q31.3 in 13 of 93 14 patients encompassing the coding regions for the microRNAs
  mir181a1 b1. In multivariable analysis with the covariates age, white blood cell
  count, platelet count, and FLT3-ITD FLT3 D835 mutations we found that after adjustment
  for patients age P amp lt 0.0001 , patients with 2 or more CNAs detected by SNP-A
  had a higher risk of death hazard ratio 5.942, P 0.0015 than patients with 0 or
  1 CNA. Deletions of 1q31.3 were associated with a higher number of CNAs median 2
  vs. 8, P amp lt 0.0001 and were a strong independent prognostic factor for an increased
  risk of relapse hazard ratio 28.9, P 0.0031 . This study presents a comprehensive
  assessment of new CNAs as pathomechanistically relevant targets and possible prognostic
  factors which could refine risk stratification of APL.
