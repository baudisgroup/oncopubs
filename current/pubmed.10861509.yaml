abstract: 'Invasive breast carcinomas are characterized by a complex pattern of chromosomal
  alterations. We applied comparative genomic hybridization CGH to analyze 105 primary
  breast carcinomas using histograms to indicate the incidence of DNA imbalances of
  tumor subgroups and difference histograms to compare invasive ductal carcinomas
  IDC with lobular carcinomas ILC , well and poorly differentiated carcinomas G1 G3
  and estrogen receptor-positive and -negative tumors ER ER - . Only single imbalances
  showed a higher incidence in ILC compared with IDC, i.e., gains on chromosomes 4
  and 5q13-q23 as well as deletions on chromosomes 6q, 11q14-qter, 12p12-pter, 16q,
  17p, 18q, 19, and 22q. Of these, particularly gains of 4 and losses at 16q21-q23,
  and 18q12-q21 were statistically significant. For most loci, IDC showed more alterations
  providing a genetic correlate to the fact that ductal carcinoma overall is associated
  with a worse prognosis than ILC. Of these, many imbalances showing statistical significance
  were also observed in G3 and ER - tumors, i.e., deletions at 2q35-q37, 3p12-p14,
  4p15-p16, 5q, 7p15, 8p22-p23, 10q, 11p, 14q21-q31, 15q, and gains at 2p, 3q21-qter,
  6p, 8q21-qter, 10p, 18p11-q11, and 20q, suggesting that they contribute to a more
  aggressive tumor phenotype. By contrast, gains on chromosome 5q13-q23 as well as
  deletions at 6q, 16q and 22q were more prevalent in G1 and ER tumors. The ratio
  profiles of all cases as well as histograms are accessible at our CGH online tumor
  database at http: amba.charite.de cgh. Our results highlight distinct chromosomal
  subregions for cancer-associated genes. In addition, these imbalances may serve
  as markers for a genetic classification of invasive breast cancer.'
