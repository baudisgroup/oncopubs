abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is genetically characterized by 11q13 translocations
  leading to the overexpression of CCND1, and additional secondary genomic alterations
  that may be important in the progression of this disease. We have analyzed 22 MCL
  cases and 10 MCL cell lines using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization
  M-FISH , FISH, and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The 19 cases with abnormal
  karyotype showed the t 11 14 q13 q32 translocation and, additionally, 89 of cases
  showed both numerical n 58 and structural n 77 aberrations. All but one MCL cell
  line showed t 11 14 and structural and numerical alterations in highly complex karyotypes.
  Besides 11 and 14, the most commonly rearranged chromosomes were 1, 8, and 10 in
  the tumors and 1, 8, and 9 in the cell lines. No recurrent translocations other
  than the t 11 14 were identified. However, we identified 17 recurrent breakpoints,
  the most frequent being 1p22 and 8p11, each observed in four cases and two cell
  lines. Interestingly, five tumors and four cell lines displayed a complex t 11 14
  , cryptic in one case and two cell lines, preferentially involving chromosome 8.
  In typical MCL, ATM gene deletions were significantly associated with a high number
  of structural and numerical alterations. In conclusion, MCL does not have recurrent
  translocations other than t 11 14 , but shows recurrent chromosomal breakpoints.
  Furthermore, most MCL harbor complex karyotypes with a high number of both structural
  and numerical alterations affecting several common breakpoints, leading to various
  balanced and unbalanced translocations.
