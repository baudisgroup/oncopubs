abstract: Here we report the genetic characterization of immortalized prostate epithelial
  cells before and after conversion to tumorigenicity using molecular cytogenetics
  and microarray technology. We were particularly interested to analyze the consequences
  of acquired chromosomal aneuploidies with respect to modifications of gene expression
  profiles. Compared with nontumorigenic but immortalized prostate epithelium, prostate
  tumor cell lines showed high levels of chromosomal rearrangements that led to gains
  of 1p, 5, 11q, 12p, 16q, and 20q and losses of 1pter, 11p, 17, 20p, 21, 22, and
  Y. Of 5700 unique targets on a 6.5K cDNA microarray, approximately 3 were subject
  to modification in expression levels these included GRO-1, -2, IAP-1,- 2, MMP-9,
  and cyclin D1, which showed increased expression, and TRAIL, BRCA1, and CTNNA, which
  showed decreased expression. Thirty of expression changes occurred in regions the
  genomic copy number of which remained balanced. Of the remainder, 42 of down-regulated
  and 51 of up-regulated genes mapped to regions present in decreased or increased
  genomic copy numbers, respectively. A relative gain or loss of a chromosome or chromosomal
  arm usually resulted in a statistically significant increase or decrease, respectively,
  in the average expression level of all of the genes on the chromosome. However,
  of these genes, very few e.g., 5 of 101 genes on chromosome 11q , and in some instances
  only two genes MMP-9 and PROCR on chromosome 20q , were overexpressed by amp gt
  or 1.7-fold when scored individually. Cluster analysis by gene function suggests
  that prostate tumorigenesis in these cell line models involves alterations in gene
  expression that may favor invasion, prevent apoptosis, and promote growth.
