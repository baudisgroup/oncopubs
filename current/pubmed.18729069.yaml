abstract: 'Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of different immune-privileged sites
  IP-DLBCLs share many clinical and biological features, such as a relatively poor
  prognosis, preferential dissemination to other immune-privileged sites, and deletion
  of the HLA region, which suggests that IP-DLBCL represents a separate entity. To
  further investigate the nature of IP-DLBCL, we investigated site-specific genomic
  aberrations in 16 testicular, nine central nervous system CNS , and 15 nodal DLBCLs
  using array CGH. We also determined minimal common regions of gain and loss. Using
  robust algorithms including multiple testing procedures and the ACE-it script, which
  is specifically designed for this task, the array CGH data were combined with gene
  expression data to explore pathways deregulated by chromosomal aberrations. Loss
  of 6p21.32-p25.3, including the HLA genes, was associated with both types of IP-DLBCL,
  whereas gain of 2p16.1-p25.3 was associated with nodal DLBCL. Gain of 12q15-q21.1
  and 12q24.32-q24.33 was associated with CNS DLBCL and gain of 19q13.12-q13.43 with
  testicular DLBCL. Analysis of candidate genes in site-specific regions and minimal
  common regions revealed two major groups of genes: one involved in the immune response,
  including regulation of HLA expression, and the other involved in apoptosis, including
  the p53 pathway. Many of these genes were also involved in homozygous deletions
  or high-level gains. The presence of both shared and site-specific aberrations in
  CNS and testicular DLBCLs underlines the concept of IP-DLBCL but also indicates
  that IP-DLBCLs of the CNS and testis do not form a single entity. The observed aberrations
  emphasize the importance of the deregulation of anti-tumour immune response and
  apoptosis pathways.'
