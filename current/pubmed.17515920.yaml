abstract: Highly rearranged and mutated cancer genomes present major challenges in
  the identification of pathogenetic events driving the neoplastic transformation
  process. Here we engineered lymphoma-prone mice with chromosomal instability to
  assess the usefulness of mouse models in cancer gene discovery and the extent of
  cross-species overlap in cancer-associated copy number aberrations. Along with targeted
  re-sequencing, our comparative oncogenomic studies identified FBXW7 and PTEN to
  be commonly deleted both in murine lymphomas and in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukaemia lymphoma T-ALL . The murine cancers acquire widespread recurrent amplifications
  and deletions targeting loci syntenic to those not only in human T-ALL but also
  in diverse human haematopoietic, mesenchymal and epithelial tumours. These results
  indicate that murine and human tumours experience common biological processes driven
  by orthologous genetic events in their malignant evolution. The highly concordant
  nature of genomic events encourages the use of genomically unstable murine cancer
  models in the discovery of biological driver events in the human oncogenome.
