abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the major malignancies worldwide.
  We have previously characterized global gene expression patterns in HCC using microarrays.
  Here, we report the analysis of genomic DNA copy number among 49 HCC samples using
  BAC array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We observed recurrent and
  characteristic chromosomal aberrations, including frequent DNA copy number gains
  of 1q, 6p, 8q and 20q, and losses of 4q, 8p, 13q, 16q and 17p. We correlated gene
  expression with array CGH data, and identified a set of genes whose expression levels
  correlated with common chromosomal aberrations in HCC. Especially, we noticed that
  high expression of Jab1 in HCC significantly correlated with DNA copy number gain
  at 8q. Quantitative microsatellite analysis further confirmed DNA copy number gain
  at the Jab1 locus. Overexpression of Jab1 in HCC was also validated using real-time
  RT-PCR, and Jab1 protein levels were studied by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays.
  Functional analysis in HCC cell lines demonstrated that Jab1 may regulate HCC cell
  proliferation, thereby having a potential role in HCC development. In conclusion,
  this study shows that array-based CGH provides high resolution mapping of chromosomal
  aberrations in HCC, and demonstrates the feasibility of correlating array CGH data
  with gene expression data to identify novel oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

notes: The data was transcribed from the original array ratio data, with automatic
  generation of a pseudo rev ish annotation. For generation of the segments, the Bioconductor
  DNAcopy package was used. Cases HK3 and SF4 and were directly transcribed on a clone-by-clone
  basis, according to ratio thresholds.
