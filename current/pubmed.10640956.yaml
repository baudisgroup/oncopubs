abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC is associated with poor prognosis
  and lymph node metastasis is one of the critical prognostic factors. Although it
  is important to elucidate the genetic aberrations underlying its lymph node metastasis,
  to the authors knowledge little is known regarding alterations in the primary ESCC
  that are linked with ESCC metastasis to the lymph nodes.
