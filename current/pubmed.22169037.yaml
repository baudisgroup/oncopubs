abstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 -amplified breast cancer represents
  a clinically well-defined subgroup due to availability of targeted treatment. However,
  HER2-amplified tumors have been shown to be heterogeneous at the genomic level by
  genome-wide microarray analyses, pointing towards a need of further investigations
  for identification of recurrent copy number alterations and delineation of patterns
  of allelic imbalance.
