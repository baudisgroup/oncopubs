abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia DBA is a congenital BM failure syndrome characterized
  by hypoproliferative anemia, associated physical abnormalities, and a predisposition
  to cancer. Perturbations of the ribosome appear to be critically important in DBA
  alterations in 9 different ribosomal protein genes have been identified in multiple
  unrelated families, along with rarer abnormalities of additional ribosomal proteins.
  However, at present, only 50 to 60 of patients have an identifiable genetic lesion
  by ribosomal protein gene sequencing. Using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism
  array to evaluate for regions of recurrent copy variation, we identified deletions
  at known DBA-related ribosomal protein gene loci in 17 9 of 51 of patients without
  an identifiable mutation, including RPS19, RPS17, RPS26, and RPL35A. No recurrent
  regions of copy variation at novel loci were identified. Because RPS17 is a duplicated
  gene with 4 copies in a diploid genome, we demonstrate haploinsufficient RPS17 expression
  and a small subunit ribosomal RNA processing abnormality in patients harboring RPS17
  deletions. Finally, we report the novel identification of variable mosaic loss involving
  known DBA gene regions in 3 patients from 2 kindreds. These data suggest that ribosomal
  protein gene deletion is more common than previously suspected and should be considered
  a component of the initial genetic evaluation in cases of suspected DBA.
