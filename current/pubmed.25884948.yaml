abstract: "Dopamine agonists (DAs) are the first-line treatment for prolactinomas,
  which account for 25-30% of functioning pituitary adenomas, and bromocriptine (BRC)
  is the only commercially available DAs in China. However, tumors are resistant to
  therapy in 5-18% of patients.  The exomes of six responsive prolactinomas and six
  resistant prolactinomas were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing.  Using stringent
  variant calling and filtering parameters, ten somatic variants that were mainly
  associated with DNA repair or protein metabolic processes were identified. New resistant
  variants were identified in multiple genes including PRDM2, PRG4, MUC4, DSPP, DPCR1,
  RP1L1, MX2, POTEF, C1orf170, and KRTAP10-3. The expression of these genes was then
  quantified by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) in 12 prolactinomas
  and 3 normal pituitary glands. The mRNA levels of PRDM2 were approximately five-fold
  lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors (p창\x80\x89<창\x80\x890.05).
  PRDM2 protein levels were lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors,
  as determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis (p창\x80\x89<창\x80\x890.05).
  Overexpression of PRDM2 upregulated dopamine receptor D2 (D2DR) and inhibited the
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MMQ cells. PRDM2 showed a synergistic effect with BRC
  on the inhibition of prolactin (PRL) secretion and MMQ cell viability, and low PRDM2
  expression was associated with tumor recurrence.  PRDM2 downregulation may play
  a role in dopamine-agonist resistance and tumor recurrence in prolactinomas."
