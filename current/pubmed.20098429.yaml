abstract: Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer after surgery has effectively lowered
  metastatic recurrence rates. However, a considerable proportion of women suffer
  recurrent cancer at distant metastatic sites despite adjuvant treatment. Identification
  of the genes crucial for tumor response to specific chemotherapy drugs is a challenge
  but is necessary to improve outcomes. By using integrated genomics, we identified
  a small number of overexpressed and amplified genes from chromosome 8q22 that were
  associated with early disease recurrence despite anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
  We confirmed the association in an analysis of multiple independent cohorts. SiRNA-mediated
  knockdown of either of two of these genes, the antiapoptotic gene YWHAZ and a lysosomal
  gene LAPTM4B, sensitized tumor cells to anthracyclines, and overexpression of either
  of the genes induced anthracycline resistance. Overexpression of LAPTM4B resulted
  in sequestration of the anthracycline doxorubicin, delaying its appearance in the
  nucleus. Overexpression of these two genes was associated with poor tumor response
  to anthracycline treatment in a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial in women with primary
  breast cancer. Our results suggest that 8q22 amplification and overexpression of
  LAPTM4B and YWHAZ contribute to de novo chemoresistance to anthracyclines and are
  permissive for metastatic recurrence. Overexpression of these two genes may predict
  anthracycline resistance and influence selection of chemotherapy.
