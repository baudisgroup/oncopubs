abstract: Diagnostic biopsy is not routinely performed for children with diffuse intrinsic
  pontine glioma DIPG . Consequently, our understanding of DIPG biology is hindered
  by limited tissue availability. We performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  on autopsy specimens to examine the feasibility of determining DNA genomic copy
  number aberrations on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FFPE blocks. Histology on
  FFPE blocks obtained from autopsy of pediatric patients with DIPG was reviewed.
  Regions were marked for processing, and DNA was extracted from the tissue core,
  labeled by chemical coupling with Cy5, and hybridized to 105K oligonucleotide CGH
  arrays. After hybridization and washing, arrays were scanned, and data segmented
  and processed with Nexus software. Twenty-two samples from 13 subjects were obtained.
  Histologic variability was noted. CGH was successfully performed on 18 of 22 samples,
  representing 11 of 13 subjects. All demonstrated DNA copy number abnormalities.
  High copy number amplification of known oncogenes and homozygous deletions of known
  tumor suppressor genes were observed. Additional regions of high copy number amplification
  and homozygous deletion and geographical variations in the CGH patterns were found.
  CGH performed on FFPE tissue obtained from autopsy yields satisfactory results.
  This sample set from patients with DIPG was highly informative, with the majority
  of specimens showing 1 abnormality related to a known cancer gene. Aberrations in
  candidate drug targets were observed. This study establishes the feasibility of
  genomic DNA analysis from DIPG autopsy material, identifies several targets for
  which molecular targeted therapy exists, and suggests significant heterogeneity
  among patients with DIPG.
