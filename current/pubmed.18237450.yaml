abstract: Urothelial carcinoma UC is characterized by nonrandom chromosomal aberrations,
  varying from one or a few changes in early-stage and low-grade tumors, to highly
  rearranged karyotypes in muscle-invasive lesions. Recent array-CGH analyses have
  shed further light on the genomic changes underlying the neoplastic development
  of UC, and have facilitated the molecular delineation amplified and deleted regions
  to the level of specific candidate genes. In the present investigation we combine
  detailed genomic information with expression information to identify putative target
  genes for genomic amplifications.
