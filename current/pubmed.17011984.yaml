abstract: Gastric cancer GCA displays a variety of genomic aberrations, including
  DNA copy number alterations, microsatellite instability MSI , and loss of heterozygosity
  LOH . The main aim of the present work was to determine the copy number aberrations
  in tumors with and without MSI or LOH. Fifteen fresh-frozen GCA samples, 11 of the
  intestinal and 4 of the diffuse type, were grouped by microsatellite analysis into
  high-level MSI MSI-H, n 2 , LOH n 5 , and microsatellite stable, LOH not detected
  MSS LOH-N, n 8 tumors. The DNA samples were subsequently analyzed by array comparative
  genomic hybridization with 16,000 cDNA clones. As expected, the LOH tumors showed
  more copy number changes however, the frequency of small-size amplifications was
  similar across all tumor groups. In addition, the cDNA arrays detected two apparently
  single-gene amplicons, at 11q13 CCND1 and 12p12.1 K-RAS , the presence of which
  were confirmed using oligonucleotide arrays. A novel amplicon at 5q13.2 was found
  only in diffuse-type tumors, which were otherwise genetically stable. The results
  suggest that DNA copy number changes may also occur in gastric cancers that show
  genomic stability in microsatellite analysis.
