abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to identify recurrent regions
  of DNA sequence loss and gain in 21 multiple myeloma MM and plasma cell leukemia
  PCL primary tumor specimens and cell lines. Multiple regions of non-random sequence
  loss and gain were observed in 8 8 primary advanced stage tumors and 13 13 cell
  lines. Identification of sequence copy number changes was facilitated by statistical
  analyses that reduce subjectivity associated with identification of copy number
  changes and by requiring that sequence changes are visible using both red- and green-labeled
  tumor DNA. Loss of sequence on 13q and 14q and gain of sequence on 1q and chromosome
  7 occurred in 50-60 of the population. In general, cell lines carry more and larger
  regions of sequence gain and loss than primary tumors. Regions of sequence copy
  number change that recur among MM cell lines and primary tumors include, in order
  of prevalence, enh 1q12qter , dim 13 , enh 7 , enh 3q22q29 , enh 11q13.3qter , dim
  14q11.2q31 , enh 8q21qter , enh 3p25pter , dim 17p11.2p13 , and dim 6q22.1q23 .
  Population distributions of genome-wide changes in primary tumors reveal amp quot
  hot-spots amp quot of sequence loss from 13q12.1-q21, 13q32-q34, 14q11.2-q13, and
  14q23-q31. Genomic changes detected using CGH are consistent with those identified
  using banding analyses, although recurrent involvement of additional regions of
  the genome are also evident. A higher prevalence of genomic changes is visible using
  CGH compared to banding. Identification of recurrent regions of sequence gain and
  loss provides opportunities to identify regions of the genome that may be involved
  in the malignant phenotype and or disease progression.
