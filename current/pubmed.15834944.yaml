abstract: The genetic hallmark of retinoblastoma is mutation or deletion of the RB1
  gene, whereas other genetic alterations that are also required are largely unknown.
  To screen for genomic imbalances on a genomewide level, we studied a series of 17
  primary retinoblastomas by matrix-based comparative genomic hybridization matrix-CGH
  . The matrix-CGH chip contained 6,000 immobilized genomic DNA fragments covering
  the human genome, with an average resolution of about 500 kb. The most frequent
  imbalances detected were gains on chromosome arms 1q 12 of 17 , 6p 10 of 17 , 2p
  5 of 17 , and 19q 4 of 17 and loss on 16q 7 of 17 . Candidate regions could be narrowed
  to small intervals by the identified minimally overlapping regions on 1q22, 1q32.1q32.2,
  2p24.1, and 6p21.33-p21.31. Furthermore, two as-yet-unknown high-level amplifications
  were detected, each in a single patient, on chromosome bands 1p34.2 and 1p33. Thus,
  this study identified new chromosomal regions and therefore potential candidate
  genes that may play a role in retinoblastoma.
