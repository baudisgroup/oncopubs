abstract: 'Tobacco-related non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with reduced
  survival and greater genomic instability. Veliparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, augments
  platinum-induced DNA damage. A phase 2 trial of untreated advanced NSCLC showed
  a trend for improved outcomes (overall survival [OS], HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.54-1.18;
  p=0.27; and progression-free survival [PFS], HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.45-1.15; p=0.17)
  when veliparib was added to carboplatin/paclitaxel. Here we report an exploratory
  analysis by smoking history.Patients were randomized 2:1 to carboplatin/paclitaxel
  with veliparib (120 mg; n=105) or placebo (n=53); stratified by histology and smoking
  history (recent smokers, n=95; former smokers, n=42; never smokers, n=21). Plasma
  cotinine was measured as a chemical index of smoking. Mutation status was assessed
  by whole exome sequencing (n=38).Smoking history, histology, age, ECOG, gender,
  and geographic region predicted veliparib benefit in univariate analyses. In a multivariate
  analysis, history of recent smoking was most predictive for veliparib benefit. Recent
  smokers treated with veliparib derive significantly greater PFS and OS benefits
  (HR 0.38, p<0.01 and HR 0.43, p<0.01) in comparison to former smokers (HR 2.098,
  p=0 208 and HR 1.62, p=0.236) and never smokers (HR 1.025, p=0.971 and HR 1.33,
  p=0.638). Sequencing data determined mutational burden was not associated with veliparib
  benefit. Grade 3/4 adverse event (AE) rate was higher in recent smokers with veliparib
  treatment; all-grade and serious AEs were similar in arms.Smoking history predicted
  for efficacy with veliparib-chemotherapy combination; toxicity was acceptable regardless
  of smoking history. A prespecified analysis of recent smokers is planned for ongoing
  phase 3 veliparib in NSCLC studies.'
