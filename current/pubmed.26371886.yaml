abstract: 'Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT) of the IV ventricle is a rare
  and recently recognized brain tumor entity. It is histologically composed by two
  distinct features: a glial component, resembling pilocytic astrocytoma, and a component
  forming neurocytic rosettes and/or perivascular rosettes. Herein, we describe a
  33-year-old man with RGNT arising in the spinal cord. Following an immunohistochemistry
  validation, we further performed an extensive genomic analysis, using array-CGH
  (aCGH), whole exome and cancer-related hotspot sequencing, in order to better understand
  its underlying biology. We observed the loss of 1p and gain of 1q, as well as gain
  of the whole chromosomes 7, 9 and 16. Local amplifications in 9q34.2 and 19p13.3
  (encompassing the gene SBNO2) were identified. Moreover, we observed focal gains/losses
  in several chromosomes. Additionally, on chromosome 7, we identified the presence
  of the KIAA1549:BRAF gene fusion, which was further validated by RT-PCR and FISH.
  Across all mutational analyses, we detected and validated the somatic mutations
  of the genes MLL2, CNNM3, PCDHGC4 and SCN1A. Our comprehensive molecular profiling
  of this RGNT suggests that MAPK pathway and methylome changes, driven by KIAA1549:BRAF
  fusion and MLL2 mutation, respectively, could be associated with the development
  of this rare tumor entity.'
