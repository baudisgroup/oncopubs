abstract: Burkitts lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized by typical
  morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular features. Gene expression profiling
  provided a molecular signature of Burkitts lymphoma, but also demonstrated that
  a subset of aggressive B-cell lymphomas not fulfilling the current World Health
  Organization criteria for the diagnosis of Burkitts lymphoma nonetheless show a
  molecular signature of Burkitts lymphoma discrepant Burkitts lymphoma . Given the
  different treatment of Burkitts lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas we investigated
  molecular differences within gene expression-defined Burkitts lymphoma.
