abstract: 'Array-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH provides a powerful
  method for simultaneous genome-wide scanning and prognostic marker assessment in
  chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . In the current study, commercially available
  bacterial artificial chromosome and oligonucleotide array CGH platforms were used
  to identify chromosomal alterations of prognostic significance in 174 CLL cases.
  Tumor genomes were initially analyzed by bacterial artificial chromosome array CGH
  followed by confirmation and breakpoint mapping using oligonucleotide arrays. Genomic
  changes involving loci currently interrogated by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH panels were detected in 155 cases 89 at expected frequencies: 13q14 loss 47
  , trisomy 12 13 , 11q loss 11 , 6q loss 7.5 , and 17p loss 4.6 . Genomic instability
  was the second most commonly identified alteration of prognostic significance with
  three or more alterations involving loci not interrogated by FISH panels identified
  in 37 CLL cases 21 . A subset of 48 CLL cases analyzed by six-probe FISH panels
  288 total hybridizations was concordant with array CGH results for 275 hybridizations
  95.5 13 hybridizations 4.5 were discordant because of clonal populations that comprised
  less than 30 of the sample. Array CGH is a powerful, cost-effective tool for genome-wide
  risk assessment in the clinical evaluation of CLL.'
