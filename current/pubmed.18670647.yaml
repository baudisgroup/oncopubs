abstract: Prostate cancer cell lines provide ideal in vitro systems for the identification
  and analysis of prostate tumor suppressors and oncogenes. A detailed characterization
  of the architecture of prostate cancer cell line genomes would facilitate the study
  of precise roles of various genes in prostate tumorigenesis in general. To contribute
  to such a characterization, we used the GeneChip 500K single nucleotide polymorphic
  SNP array for analysis of genotypes and relative DNA copy number changes across
  the genome of 11 cell lines derived from both normal and cancerous prostate tissues.
  For comparison purposes, we also examined the alterations observed in the cell lines
  in tumor normal pairs of clinical samples from 72 patients. Along with genome-wide
  maps of DNA copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity for these cell lines,
  we report previously unreported homozygous deletions and recurrent amplifications
  in prostate cancers in this study. The homozygous deletions affected a number of
  biologically important genes, including PPP2R2A and BNIP3L identified in this study
  and CDKN2A CDKN2B reported previously. Although most amplified genomic regions tended
  to be large, amplifications at 8q24.21 were of particular interest because the affected
  regions are relatively small, are found in multiple cell lines, are located near
  MYC, an oncogene strongly implicated in prostate tumorigenesis, and are known to
  harbor SNPs that are associated with inherited susceptibility for prostate cancer.
  The genomic alterations revealed in this study provide an important catalog of positional
  information relevant to efforts aimed at deciphering the molecular genetic basis
  of prostate cancer.
