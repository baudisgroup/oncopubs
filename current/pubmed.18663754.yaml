abstract: The etiology of mycosis fungoides MF , the most frequent form of cutaneous
  T cell lymphoma CTCL , is poorly understood. No specific genetic aberration has
  been detected, especially in early-stage disease, possibly due to the clinical and
  histological heterogeneity of patient series and to the different sources of malignant
  cells skin, blood, or lymph node included in most studies. Frozen skin biopsies
  from 16 patients with early-stage MF were studied using array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization. A DNA pool from healthy donors was used as the reference.
  Results demonstrated recurrent loss of 19, 7p22.1-p22.3, 7q11.1-q11.23, 9q34.12,
  12q24.31, and 16q22.3-q23.1, and gain of 8q22.3-q23.1 and 21q22.12. The 12q24.31
  region was recurrently deleted in 7 16 patients. Real-time PCR investigation for
  deletion of genes BCL7A, SMAC DIABLO, and RHOF-three tumor suppressor genes with
  a putative role in hematological malignancies-demonstrated that they were deleted
  in 9, 10, and 13 cases, respectively. The identified genomic alterations and individual
  genes could yield important insights into the early steps of MF pathogenesis.
