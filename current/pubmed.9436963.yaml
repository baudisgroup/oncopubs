abstract: Solitary fibrous tumor SFT presenting in the pleura and other soft tissue
  sites and hemangiopericytoma HPC presenting at various soft tissue sites are mesenchymal
  tumors that share many histologic and immunohistochemical features. This raises
  the questions of whether these tumors are related and whether they belong within
  the spectrum of a single biologic entity. The behavior of both SFTs and HPCs is
  difficult to predict histologically. The genetic background of both SFTs and HPCs
  is poorly known, but it could be helpful in the evaluation of malignancy and could
  give clues to their possible relationship. In this study, we analyzed 15 SFTs and
  11 HPCs by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , a powerful molecular cytogenetic
  tool that can be applied to DNA extracted from formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded
  tissue. All of these tumors were immunohistochemically similar and showed reactivity
  for CD34-antigen but not for keratins, desmin, or muscle actins. Only 1 SFT smaller
  than 10 cm showed DNA copy number changes a single loss in chromosome 13 , but 7
  of 8 SFTs larger than 10 cm including all 4 tumors with more than 4 mitoses per
  10 high power fields showed changes, mostly chromosomal gains in 5q 7, 8, 12, and
  18. Four cases showed losses, two of them in chromosome 13 and two others in 20q.
  These findings suggest that CGH might be useful in the evaluation of malignant transformation
  in SFT. The most common change, gain of the entire chromosome 8, seen in two cases
  as the only change, suggests trisomy 8 and parallels a similar finding previously
  described in other fibrous tumors, such as subsets of desmoid fibromatosis and infantile
  fibrosarcoma. In contrast, HPCs, including large and mitotically active tumors,
  showed no DNA copy number changes on CGH. This suggests that HPC is genetically
  different from SFT.
