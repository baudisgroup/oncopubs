abstract: Our aim was to investigate the presence of DNA copy number changes in gastric
  adenomas and to identify the changes that may play a role in gastric carcinogenesis.
  DNA copy number changes in 16 patients with gastric adenoma and in 22 tumors from
  patients with intestinal type gastric carcinomas were studied by using comparative
  genomic hybridization. DNA copy number changes were found in 44 of the adenoma cases
  and in 86 of the intestinal type gastric carcinomas. On average, gains were more
  common than losses 0.9 vs. 0.5 in adenomas and 4.1 vs. 1.8 in carcinomas . In adenomas,
  the most common gains involved chromosome 8 in 3 cases, and gain of chromosome 7
  and 20q was detected in 2 cases. The most frequent losses were observed at 5q three
  times . Only adenomas with severe dysplasia showed high-level amplifications that
  were detected at chromosome 13, 17cen-q22, and 20q12-ter. In gastric cancer, the
  most common gains were detected at 20q 55 , 17q12-q21 41 , and 8q 41 , and the most
  common losses were detected at 18q 41 and 4q 32 . High-level amplifications were
  observed at 20q 3 tumors , 17cen-q21 3 tumors , 2p 1 tumor , and 18q 1 tumor . These
  findings suggest that the progression of dysplasia is associated with higher levels
  of DNA copy number increase e.g., the gains at 17q and 20q , which were typically
  observed in the intestinal type gastric cancer. Furthermore, the results support
  the hypothesis that adenoma precedes cancer.
