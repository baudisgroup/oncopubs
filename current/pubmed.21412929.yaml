abstract: The current classification of diffuse low-grade gliomas is based mainly
  on histopathological criteria, which cannot accurately predict the highly variable
  clinical course observed in patients with such tumors. In an attempt to increase
  pathogenetic understanding of these tumors, we investigated 38 WHO Grade II astrocytomas,
  oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas using a combination of G-band chromosome
  analysis and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization HR-CGH . Abnormal
  karyotypes were found in 41 of tumors. Karyotypes of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas
  were near-diploid whereas oligoastrocytomas also displayed near-tetraploid clones.
  The most common aberrations were losses of chromosomes X, Y, 3, 4, 6, and 11 and
  gains of chromosomes 8 and 12. The only recurrent structural rearrangement was del
  6 q21 . HR-CGH analysis verified karyotyping findings but also revealed frequent
  losses at 1p, 17q, and 19q and gains of 7q, 10p, 11q, and 20p. Among the tumors
  were two gemistocytic astrocytomas, a subgroup of diffuse astrocytomas with a particular
  predisposition for progression but not studied cytogenetically before one showed
  a near-diploid, complex karyotype with structural aberrations of chromosomes 1,
  3, and 11 whereas both displayed simple aberrations including loss of 11p by HR-CGH.
  Our findings suggest that within diffuse low-grade gliomas are genetically distinct
  entities that do not fit the currently used classification. In addition, tumors
  with complex chromosomal aberrations had a higher tendency for aggressive tumor
  behavior shorter progression-free survival than tumors displaying simple aberrations
  only P 0.07 . This could help identify genetic subsets of patients with low-grade
  glioma who might benefit from early antineoplastic therapy.
