abstract: YWHAZ, also known as 14-3-3zeta, has been reportedly elevated in many human
  tumors, including non-small cell lung carcinoma NSCLC but little is known about
  its specific contribution to lung cancer malignancy. Through a combined array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization and expression microarray analysis, we identified
  YWHAZ as a potential metastasis enhancer in lung cancer. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ
  on low invasive cancer cells showed enhanced cell invasion, migration in vitro,
  and both the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials in vivo. Gene array analysis
  has indicated these changes associated with an elevation of pathways relevant to
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT , with an increase of cell protrusions and
  branchings. Conversely, knockdown of YWHAZ levels with siRNA or short hairpin RNA
  shRNA in invasive cancer cells led to a reversal of EMT. We observed that high levels
  of YWHAZ protein are capable of activating -catenin-mediated transcription by facilitating
  the accumulation of -catenin in cytosol and nucleus. Coimmunoprecipitation assays
  showed a decrease of ubiquitinated -catenin in presence of the interaction between
  YWHAZ and -catenin. This interaction resulted in disassociating -catenin from the
  binding of -TrCP leading to increase -catenin stability. Using enforced expression
  of dominant-negative and -positive -catenin mutants, we confirmed that S552 phosphorylation
  of -catenin increases the -catenin YWHAZ complex formation, which is important in
  promoting cell invasiveness and the suppression of ubiquitnated -catenin. This is
  the first demonstration showing YWHAZ through its complex with -catenin in mediating
  lung cancer malignancy and -catenin protein stability.
