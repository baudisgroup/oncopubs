abstract: Local lymph node and blood metastasis could occur at early stage of esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma ESCC , which may be the key factors of its recurrence and
  poor prognosis. However, the mechanism of ESCC metastasis is unclear. This study
  was to analyze the genetic changes in primary lesion and lymph node metastases of
  ESCC, to screen for and locate ESCC metastasis-related genes.
