abstract: Copy neutral loss of heterozygosity CN-LOH refers to a special case of LOH
  occurring without any resulting loss in copy number. These alterations is sometimes
  seen in tumors as a way to inactivate a tumor suppressor gene and have been found
  to be important in several types of cancer.
