abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis was performed on 36 neuroblastomas
  of both low and high stage of disease. This study significantly increases the number
  of neuroblastoma tumors studied by CGH. Analysis of larger series of tumors is particularly
  important in view of the different clinical subgroups that are recognized for this
  tumor. The present data and a comparison with all published CGH data on neuroblastoma
  provide further insights into the genetic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma. Stage
  1, 2, and 4S tumors showed predominantly whole chromosome gains and losses. A similar
  pattern of whole chromosome imbalances, although less frequent, was observed in
  stage 3 and 4 tumors, in addition to partial chromosome gains and losses. An increase
  in chromosome 17 or 17q copy number was observed in 81 of tumors. The most frequent
  losses, either through partial or whole chromosome underrepresentation, were observed
  for 1p 25 , 3p 25 , 4p 14 , 9p 19 , 11q 28 , and 14q 31 . The presence of 3p, 11q
  or 14q deletions defines a genetic subset of neuroblastomas and contributes to the
  further genetic characterization of stage 3 and 4 tumors without MYCN amplification
  MNA and 1p deletion. The present study also provides additional evidence for a possible
  role of genes at 11q13 in neuroblastoma. In a few cases, 1p deletion or MNA detected
  by FISH or Southern blotting was not found by CGH, indicating that the use of a
  second, independent technique for evaluation of these genetic parameters is recommended.
