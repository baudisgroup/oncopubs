abstract: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare endocrine malignancy with an estimated incidence
  of less than 1 per million population. Excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone,
  extremely high serum calcium level, and the deleterious effects of hypercalcaemia
  are the clinical manifestations of the disease. Up to 60 of patients develop multiple
  disease recurrences and although long-term survival is possible with palliative
  surgery, permanent remission is rarely achieved. Molecular drivers of sporadic parathyroid
  carcinoma have remained largely unknown. Previous studies, mostly based on familial
  cases of the disease, suggested potential roles for the tumour suppressor MEN1 and
  proto-oncogene RET in benign parathyroid tumourigenesis, while the tumour suppressor
  HRPT2 and proto-oncogene CCND1 may also act as drivers in parathyroid cancer. Here,
  we report the complete genomic analysis of a sporadic and recurring parathyroid
  carcinoma. Mutational landscapes of the primary and recurrent tumour specimens were
  analysed using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Such molecular profiling
  allowed for identification of somatic mutations never previously identified in this
  malignancy. These included single nucleotide point mutations in well-characterized
  cancer genes such as mTOR, MLL2, CDKN2C, and PIK3CA. Comparison of acquired mutations
  in patient-matched primary and recurrent tumours revealed loss of PIK3CA activating
  mutation during the evolution of the tumour from the primary to the recurrence.
  Structural variations leading to gene fusions and regions of copy loss and gain
  were identified at a single-base resolution. Loss of the short arm of chromosome
  1, along with somatic missense and truncating mutations in CDKN2C and THRAP3, respectively,
  provides new evidence for the potential role of these genes as tumour suppressors
  in parathyroid cancer. The key somatic mutations identified in this study can serve
  as novel diagnostic markers as well as therapeutic targets.
