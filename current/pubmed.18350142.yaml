abstract: Heregulin beta-1 HRG is an extracellular ligand that activates mitogen-activated
  protein kinase MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase PI3K Akt signaling pathways
  through ErbB receptors. MAPK and Akt have been shown to phosphorylate the estrogen
  receptor ER at Ser-118 and Ser-167, respectively, thereby mimicking the effects
  of estrogenic activity such as estrogen responsive element ERE -dependent transcription.
  In the current study, integrative analysis was performed using two tiling array
  platforms, comprising histone H3 lysine 9 H3K9 acetylation and RNA mapping, together
  with array comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis in an effort to identify
  HRG-regulated genes in ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Through application
  of various threshold settings, 333 326 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated HRG-regulated
  genes were detected. Prediction of upstream transcription factors TFs and pathway
  analysis indicated that 21 of HRG-induced gene regulation may be controlled by the
  MAPK cascade, while only 0.6 of the gene expression is controlled by ERE. A comparison
  with previously reported estrogen E2 -regulated gene expression data revealed that
  only 12 common genes were identified between the 333 HRG-regulated 3.6 and 239 E2-regulated
  5.0 gene groups. However, with respect to enriched upstream TFs, 4 common TFs were
  identified in the 14 HRG-regulated 28.6 and 13 E2-regulated 30.8 gene groups. These
  results indicated that while E2 and HRG may induce common TFs, the regulatory mechanisms
  that govern HRG- and E2-induced gene expression differ.
