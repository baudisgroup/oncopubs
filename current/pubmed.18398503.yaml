abstract: The molecular pathogenesis of pediatric astrocytomas is still poorly understood.
  To further understand the genetic abnormalities associated with these tumors, we
  performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number aberrations in pediatric low-grade
  astrocytomas by using array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Duplication
  of the BRAF protooncogene was the most frequent genomic aberration, and tumors with
  BRAF duplication showed significantly increased mRNA levels of BRAF and a downstream
  target, CCND1, as compared with tumors without duplication. Furthermore, denaturing
  HPLC showed that activating BRAF mutations were detected in some of the tumors without
  BRAF duplication. Similarly, a marked proportion of low-grade astrocytomas from
  adult patients also had BRAF duplication. Both the stable silencing of BRAF through
  shRNA lentiviral transduction and pharmacological inhibition of MEK1 2, the immediate
  downstream phosphorylation target of BRAF, blocked the proliferation and arrested
  the growth of cultured tumor cells derived from low-grade gliomas. Our findings
  implicate aberrant activation of the MAPK pathway due to gene duplication or mutation
  of BRAF as a molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in low-grade astrocytomas and suggest
  inhibition of the MAPK pathway as a potential treatment.

notes: In contrast to the >40  peak at 7q34 shown in the article, our analysis of
  the data resulted in approx. 20  gains there. However, the other cases showed a
  single clone gain in the locus, corresponding to the FISH verified BRAF region duplication
  described in the article (communication with S. Pfister).
