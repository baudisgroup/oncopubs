abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death, with non-small
  cell lung cancer NSCLC being the predominant form of the disease. Most lung cancer
  is caused by the accumulation of genomic alterations due to tobacco exposure. To
  uncover its mutational landscape, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 31 NSCLCs
  and their matched normal tissue samples. We identified both common and unique mutation
  spectra and pathway activation in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas,
  two major histologies in NSCLC. In addition to identifying previously known lung
  cancer genes TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and RB1 , the analysis revealed many genes
  not previously implicated in this malignancy. Notably, a novel gene CSMD3 was identified
  as the second most frequently mutated gene next to TP53 in lung cancer. We further
  demonstrated that loss of CSMD3 results in increased proliferation of airway epithelial
  cells. The study provides unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular
  pathways and gene networks associated with lung cancer. Of potential immediate clinical
  relevance, several highly mutated genes identified in our study are promising druggable
  targets in cancer therapy including ALK, CTNNA3, DCC, MLL3, PCDHIIX, PIK3C2B, PIK3CG
  and ROCK2.
