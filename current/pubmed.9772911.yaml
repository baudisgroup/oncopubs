abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was used to search for DNA copy number
  changes in samples of gastric cancer from 12 hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer
  HNPCC patients and in samples of sporadic gastric carcinoma from 13 patients. The
  gastric cancer samples from HNPCC patients showed gains affecting 19q, Xp, and whole
  chromosome 22, each in a single patient. Neither high-level amplifications nor losses
  of DNA copy number were detected. On the other hand, 10 of the 13 77 sporadic gastric
  carcinoma samples had multiple DNA copy number changes. The most frequent gains
  occurred with minimal common overlapping regions at 1q22-q31, 8q23-qter, 17p11.2-q22,
  and 20q, all at a frequency of 31 . High-level amplifications were also seen at
  17q21 in three cases 23 . Losses were rare, and the most frequent loss was with
  a minimal common overlapping region at 4q32 23 . This suggests that multiple DNA
  copy number changes are needed for the development of sporadic gastric carcinoma
  but not for gastric carcinoma in HNPCC patients.
