abstract: Data presented in a number of recent studies have revealed a negative correlation
  between CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP and chromosomal instability CIN measured
  by a loss of heterozygosity LOH of selected loci, suggesting that CIN and CIMP represent
  two independent mechanisms in sporadic colorectal cancer CRC carcinogenesis. However,
  CIN is a heterogeneous phenomenon, which may be studied not only by employing LOH
  analysis but also by observing chromosomal imbalances gains and deletions . The
  current study aimed to investigate the relationship between CIMP and chromosomal
  gains and deletions assessed by comparative genomic hybridization in a group of
  20 CIMP-high and 79 CIMP-low CIMP-0 CRCs. Our results revealed that the mean numbers
  of gains and of total chromosomal imbalances were significantly greater p 0.004
  and p 0.007, respectively in the CIMP-low CIMP-0 group compared to the CIMP-high
  group, while no significant difference was observed between the mean numbers of
  losses p 0.056 . The analysis of copy number changes of 41 cancer-related genes
  by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed that CRK gene was exclusively
  deleted in CIMP-low CIMP-0 tumors p 0.02 . Given that chromosomal losses play an
  important role in tumor suppressor inactivation and chromosomal gains, in the activation
  of proto-oncogenes, we hypothesize that tumor suppressor inactivation plays similar
  roles in both CIMP-high and CIMP-low CIMP-0 CRCs, while the predominance of chromosomal
  gains in CIMP-low CIMP-0 tumors may suggest that the activation of proto-oncogenes
  is the underlying mechanism of CIMP-low CIMP-0 CRC progression.
