abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been proven to be an important
  tool in interphase cytogenetics of solid tumors. Although, because of methodological
  implications, balanced aberrations are not detected by CGH, the technique has uncovered
  a variety of new and interesting imbalanced karyotype changes. However, only a few
  studies deal with its application to hematologic disorders, although this is a main
  topic of cytogenetics. The aim of our study was, therefore, to evaluate the usefulness
  of CGH in the examination of hematologic neoplasms. For this purpose, bone marrow
  aspirates of 33 patients with different hematologic disorders were examined with
  CGH and the results compared with conventional cytogenetics (CC) and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization (FISH). CGH showed chromosome changes in 8 of 33 cases. CC
  found balanced aberrations in 4 of 33 and unbalanced changes in 9 of 33 samples.
  Differences between CGH and CC in unbalanced aberrations were seen in four cases.
  In these samples, either the number of aberrant cells found by CC was low and, therefore,
  difficult to detect by CGH, or complex aberrations in different cell clones as seen
  in CC were lumped together as one karyotype by CGH. In one sample, CC was not capable
  of giving any results at all, whereas CGH showed trisomy 8. CGH was also helpful
  in defining the bands involved in the structural aberrations, which was difficult
  by CC in some cases because of the low quality of metaphase spreads. All results
  obtained by CGH were confirmed by FISH, whereas CC and FISH were discordant in one
  case. Although CGH was not able to detect all aberrations, it gave important additional
  information for the correct localization of the aberrations found in CC, and it
  was most helpful in samples not processed successfully in CC. These advantages would
  open up a new field of application for CGH not only for research, but also for diagnostic
  purposes.
