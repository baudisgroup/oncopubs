abstract: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma MBL is an aggressive Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma,
  which has been recognized as a distinct disease entity. We performed a comprehensive
  molecular cytogenetic study analyzing 43 MBLs. By comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , the most common aberrations were gains of chromosome arms 9p and Xq, which
  were present in 56 and 40 of cases, respectively. Based on the limited resolution
  of CGH, this technique may underestimate the real incidence of aberrations. Therefore,
  we also did an interphase cytogenetic study with eight DNA probes mapping to chromosome
  regions frequently altered in B-cell lymphomas. With this approach, both 9p and
  Xq gains were found in more than 70 of cases 75 and 87 , respectively . The findings
  were compared with results obtained in 308 other B-cell lymphomas. Gains in 9p were
  identified in only six of the 308 cases, and only one of these lymphomas with 9p
  gains was not primarily extranodal in origin P amp lt 10- 20 for CGH data and P
  amp lt 10- 11 for fluorescence in situ hybridization data . We also present a novel
  MBL cell line, MedB-1, which carries the genetic aberrations characteristic of this
  entity.
