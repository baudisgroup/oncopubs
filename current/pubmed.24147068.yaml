abstract: Neuroblastoma is one of the most genomically heterogeneous childhood malignances
  studied to date, and the molecular events that occur during the course of the disease
  are not fully understood. Genomic studies in neuroblastoma have showed only a few
  recurrent mutations and a low somatic mutation burden. However, none of these studies
  has examined the mutations arising during the course of disease, nor have they systemically
  examined the expression of mutant genes. Here we performed genomic analyses on tumors
  taken during a 3.5 years disease course from a neuroblastoma patient (bone marrow
  biopsy at diagnosis, adrenal primary tumor taken at surgical resection, and a liver
  metastasis at autopsy). Whole genome sequencing of the index liver metastasis identified
  44 non-synonymous somatic mutations in 42 genes (0.85 mutation/MB) and a large hemizygous
  deletion in the ATRX gene which has been recently reported in neuroblastoma. Of
  these 45 somatic alterations, 15 were also detected in the primary tumor and bone
  marrow biopsy, while the other 30 were unique to the index tumor, indicating accumulation
  of de novo mutations during therapy. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing on the
  3 tumors demonstrated only 3 out of the 15 commonly mutated genes (LPAR1, GATA2,
  and NUFIP1) had high level of expression of the mutant alleles, suggesting potential
  oncogenic driver roles of these mutated genes. Among them, the druggable G-protein
  coupled receptor LPAR1 was highly expressed in all tumors. Cells expressing the
  LPAR1 R163W mutant demonstrated a significantly increased motility through elevated
  Rho signaling, but had no effect on growth. Therefore, this study highlights the
  need for multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and combinatorial
  DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of expressed driver
  mutations.
