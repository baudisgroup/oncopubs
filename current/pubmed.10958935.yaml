abstract: 'The heterogeneous nature of genetic alterations in cancer cells handicaps
  the full characterization of its occurrence and the analysis of their molecular
  bases and relation to biological processes. Although many cancer cells are highly
  aneuploid, in other cases, as in a subset of colorectal carcinomas displaying microsatellite
  instability, chromosomal aberrations are scarce. The aim of this study was to fully
  characterize both qualitatively and quantitatively, the karyotypes of two established
  colon carcinoma cell lines LoVo and HCT 116 previously reported as being near diploid.
  An array of complementary cytogenetic techniques were used: G-banding, comparative
  genome hybridization CGH , and whole-chromosome painting WCP . Combinations of these
  techniques provided an accurate karyotype for the two cell lines: LoVo cells showed
  49,XY,t 2 12 q13 p11.2 , 5, 7, 12,i 15 q10 and HCT 116 cells showed 45,X,-Y,dup
  10 q24q26 ,der 16 t 8 16 q13 p13 , der 18 t 17 18 q21 p11.3 . Heterogeneity was
  also observed in both cell lines as shown by G-banding. Chromosomal unbalances determined
  by CGH many of them related to structural reorganizations were characterized by
  WCP, allowing the reliable identification of those chromosome markers that could
  not be completely identified by G-banding. We show that combined analysis with classical
  and molecular cytogenetic techniques provides an accurate map of chromosomal aberrations
  in these two cell lines not identified in previous investigations.'
