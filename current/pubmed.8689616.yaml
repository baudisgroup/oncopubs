abstract: The molecular basis of malignant mesothelioma is poorly known. We examined
  genetic changes in 11 mesothelioma specimens by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Five DNA specimens originated from uncultured tumor tissues and six from cell
  lines established from the same patients. Findings from the classical karyotypic
  characterization of both primary tumors and cell lines have been reported previously.
  In the CGH analyses the most common genetic alterations in the 11 mesothelioma specimens
  were losses of chromosomal regions in 1p, 8p, 14q, and 22q and gains of 5p, 6p,
  8q, 15q, 17q, and 20. The cell lines had on average a much higher total number of
  genetic changes than the uncultured tumor specimens. Clonal relationship between
  the cell lines and the uncultured tissue specimens could not usually be demonstrated
  even though they originated from the same patient. The observed differences may
  partly be due to high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements, which CGH cannot
  detect, partly due to contamination of tumor specimens with normal tissue, and partly
  due to genetic evolution in tumor cell lines.
