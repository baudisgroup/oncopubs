abstract: Genome-wide screening for chromosomal imbalances using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH revealed a wealth of data on previously unrecognized tumor-specific
  genomic alterations. CGH to microarrays of DNA, an approach termed matrix-CGH, allows
  detection of genomic imbalances at a much higher resolution. We show that matrix
  CGH is also feasible from small tissue samples requiring universal amplification
  of genomic DNA. Because widespread application of matrix-CGH experiments using large
  numbers of DNA targets demands a high degree of automation, we have developed a
  protocol for a fully automated procedure. The use of specialized instrumentation
  for the generation of DNA chips, their hybridization, scanning, and evaluation required
  numerous alterations and modifications of the initial protocol. We here present
  the elaboration and testing of automated matrix-CGH. A chip consisting of 188 different
  genomic DNA fragments, cloned in bacterial artificial chromosome BAC or P1-derived
  artificial chromosome PAC vectors and immobilized in replicas of 10, was used to
  assess the performance of the automated protocol in determining the gene dosage
  variations in tumor cell lines COLO320-HSR, HL60, and NGP. Although ratios of matrix-CGH
  were highly concordant with results of chromosomal CGH 85 , the dynamic range of
  the matrix-CGH ratios was highly superior. Investigation of the two amplicons on
  8q24 in COLO320-HSR and HL60, containing the MYC gene, revealed a homogeneous amplicon
  in COLO320-HSR but a heterogeneous amplification pattern in HL60 cells. Although
  control clones for normalization of the signal ratios can be predicted in cases
  with defined chromosomal aberrations, in primary tumors such data are often not
  available, requiring alternative normalization algorithms. Testing such algorithms
  in a primary high-grade B-cell lymphoma, we show the feasibility of this approach.
  With the matrix-CGH protocol presented here, robust and reliable detection of genomic
  gains and losses is accomplished in an automated fashion, which provides the basis
  for widespread application in tumor and clinical genetics.
