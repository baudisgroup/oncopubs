abstract: We present a general method for rigorously identifying correlations between
  variations in large-scale molecular profiles and outcomes and apply it to chromosomal
  comparative genomic hybridization data from a set of 52 breast tumors. We identify
  two loci where copy number abnormalities are correlated with poor survival outcome
  gain at 8q24 and loss at 9q13 . We also identify a relationship between abnormalities
  at two loci and the mutational status of p53. Gain at 8q24 and loss at 5q15-5q21
  are linked with mutant p53. The 9q and 5q losses suggest the possibility of gene
  products involved in breast cancer progression. The analytical techniques are general
  and also are applicable to the analysis of array-based expression data.
