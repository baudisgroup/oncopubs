abstract: 'Whole exome sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA) analysis were performed
  on cells taken from peripheral blood (PB) and lymph nodes (LN) of patients with
  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Of 64 non-silent somatic mutations, 54 (84ï¿½4%)
  were clonal in both compartments, 3 (4ï¿½7%) were PB-specific and 7 (10ï¿½9%) were
  LN-specific. Most of the LN- or PB-specific mutations were subclonal in the other
  corresponding compartment (variant frequency 0ï¿½5-5ï¿½3%). Of 41 CNAs, 27 (65ï¿½8%)
  were shared by both compartments and 7 (17ï¿½1%) were LN- or PB-specific. Overall,
  6 of 9 cases (66ï¿½7%) showed genomic differences between the compartments. At subsequent
  relapse, Case 10, with 6 LN-specific lesions, and Case 100, with 6 LN-specific and
  8 PB-specific lesions, showed, in the PB, the clonal expansion of LN-derived lesions
  with an adverse impact: SF3B1 mutation, BIRC3 deletion, del8(p23ï¿½3-p11ï¿½1), del9(p24ï¿½3-p13ï¿½1)
  and gain 2(p25ï¿½3-p14). CLL shows an intra-patient clonal heterogeneity according
  to the disease compartment, with both LN and PB-specific mutations/CNAs. The LN
  microenvironment might contribute to the clonal selection of unfavourable lesions,
  as LN-derived mutations/CNAs can appear in the PB at relapse.  ï¿½ 2015 John Wiley
