abstract: 'The present study has compared immunohistological marker expression profiles
  and genomic imbalances in seven African endemic Burkitts lymphomas eBLs with those
  in ten European B-cell lymphomas with MYC rearrangement as shown by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH analysis. eBLs showed a typical histomorphology and a
  homogeneous immuno-profile: CD10 , CD38 , CD77 , bcl-2-, and IgM . Epstein-Barr
  virus EBV DNA was present in all cases. On comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  , only three out of six eBLs showed imbalances median number of imbalances 2 , with
  gains on chromosome 17 in two eBLs. The European lymphomas were all highly proliferating,
  with a Ki-67 index of at least 90 , and included seven with morphology typical of
  sporadic Burkitts lymphoma sBL and three immunoblastic diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
  with MYC rearrangement MYCre DLBCL . In contrast to eBL, the immuno-profiles of
  the European lymphomas were less homogeneous and inconsistent for CD10, CD38, CD77,
  IgM and bcl-2 expression. EBV DNA was not detected. In five of seven sBLs, CGH showed
  a higher number of imbalances median 6 , with recurrent gains on chromosome 1q 3
  7 and losses on 12q and 17p 2 7 , whereas all three MYCre DLBCLs had fewer imbalances
  median 4 , with gains on 17q in two of three lymphomas. It is concluded that eBL
  has a homogeneous immunohistology and few secondary genomic aberrations, whereas
  MYC-rearranged and highly proliferating European B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous
  group that includes sBL and a subgroup of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.'
