abstract: This study aimed to estimate the gene loci associated with carcinogenesis
  of endocervical adenocarcinoma of uterus EA and metastasis. Study design Sixteen
  patients with EA were studied 6 had nodal metastasis. DNA was extracted from EAs,
  and subjected to both conventional comparative genomic hybridization CGH and array-based
  CGH. Copy number abnormalities were compared between cases with and without nodal
  metastasis.
