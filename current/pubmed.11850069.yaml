abstract: Histopathological differentiation between dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
  DFSP and dermatofibroma DF is often difficult, because both neoplasms share some
  clinical features and the presence of a storiform pattern. In the present study,
  we investigated the usefulness of comparative genomic hybridization CGH in the diagnosis
  of these entities by examining 12 DFSP and 12 DF cases. The most frequent DNA sequence
  copy number changes detected in 10 83 of 12 DFSP cases mean, 1.9 aberrations tumor
  range, 0-3 consisted of gains of 17q22-qter 10 tumors , 22q13 nine tumors , and
  8q24.1-qter three tumors . High-level amplification, which was detected in three
  tumors, was seen only in chromosome 17, with 17q23-q25 as the minimal common region.
  Loss of DNA sequences was not found in DFSP cases. In contrast, two 17 of the 12
  DF cases mean, 0.5 aberrations tumor range, 0-4 showed DNA sequence copy number
  changes, although recurrent gains and losses and high-level amplifications were
  not observed. Gains were more common than losses in DF. Overrepresentation of 17q
  and 22q sequences was a common finding in DFSP but not in DF. Thus, CGH seems to
  be useful for distinguishing DFSP from DF in most cases.
