abstract: Twenty-five cases of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL
  from Down syndrome DS patients were analyzed using array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH and compared with two other subgroups of non-DS patients with ALL five cases
  with high-hyperdiploidy HH and nine cases with ETV6-RUNX1 positive clones. Seven
  cases of DS-acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia AMKL were also included, DS-ALL cases
  showed relatively stable karyotypes with cryptic losses and gains that most frequently
  involved chromosomes X, 1, 2, 9, 11, 16, and 17. The most consistent change involved
  a deletion in 2p, spanning region Chr2:88273220-91084234, which in some cases appeared
  to be homozygous. ALL from non-DS patients showed a similar overall karyotypic stability,
  although gains of chromosome 21 were infrequent in the ETV6-RUNX1 positive cases.
  The most consistent change in this group involved a 12p deletion, where Chr12:10383878-16017619
  defined the common region of overlap. All HH-ALL karyotypes showed variable gains
  of chromosome 21. This overall analysis supports the suggestion that, although constitutional
  trisomy 21 predisposes to ALL AMKL, the cytogenetic changes associated with DS-ALL
  in particular, are most similar to those found in non-DS ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL.
  The HH-ALL group, however, undergoes distinct karyotypic evolution not dependent
  on chromosome translocation deletion events.
