abstract: A major challenge facing DNA copy number CN studies of tumors is that most
  banked samples with extensive clinical follow-up information are Formalin-Fixed
  Paraffin Embedded FFPE . DNA from FFPE samples generally underperforms or suffers
  high failure rates compared to fresh frozen samples because of DNA degradation and
  cross-linking during FFPE fixation and processing. As FFPE protocols may vary widely
  between labs and samples may be stored for decades at room temperature, an ideal
  FFPE CN technology should work on diverse sample sets. Molecular Inversion Probe
  MIP technology has been applied successfully to obtain high quality CN and genotype
  data from cell line and frozen tumor DNA. Since the MIP probes require only a small
  approximately 40 bp target binding site, we reasoned they may be well suited to
  assess degraded FFPE DNA. We assessed CN with a MIP panel of 50,000 markers in 93
  FFPE tumor samples from 7 diverse collections. For 38 FFPE samples from three collections
  we were also able to asses CN in matched fresh frozen tumor tissue.
