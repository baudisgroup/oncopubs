abstract: Multiple genetic alterations are responsible for development and progression
  of gastric cancer which is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
  The aim of this study was to identify the genomic imbalances of gains and or losses
  in gastric adenocarcinomas from Turkish patients and to investigate their association
  with development and progression of this type of cancer.
