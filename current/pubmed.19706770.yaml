abstract: 'To identify genetic events that characterize cancer progression, we conducted
  a comprehensive genetic evaluation of 161 primary breast tumors. Similar to the
  amp quot mountain-and-hill amp quot view of mutations, gene amplification also shows
  high- and low-frequency alterations in breast cancers. The frequently amplified
  genes include the well-known oncogenes ERBB2, FGFR1, MYC, CCND1, and PIK3CA, whereas
  other known oncogenes that are amplified, although less frequently, include CCND2,
  EGFR, FGFR2, and NOTCH3. More importantly, by honing in on minimally amplified regions
  containing three or fewer genes, we identified six new amplified genes: POLD3, IRAK4,
  IRX2, TBL1XR1, ASPH, and BRD4. We found that both the IRX2 and TBL1XR1 proteins
  showed higher expression in the malignant cell lines MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a than
  in their precursor, MCF10A, a normal immortalized mammary epithelial cell line.
  To study oncogenic roles of TBL1XR1, we performed knockdown experiments using a
  short hairpin RNA approach and found that depletion of TBL1XR1 in MCF10CA1h cells
  resulted in reduction of cell migration and invasion as well as suppression of tumorigenesis
  in mouse xenografts. Intriguingly, our mutation analysis showed the presence of
  activation mutations in the PIK3CA gene in a subset of tumors that also had DNA
  copy number increases in the PIK3CA locus, suggesting an additive effect of coexisting
  activating amino acid substitution and dosage increase from amplification. Our gene
  amplification and somatic mutation analysis of breast primary tumors provides a
  coherent picture of genetic events, both corroborating and novel, offering insight
  into the genetic underpinnings of breast cancer progression.'
