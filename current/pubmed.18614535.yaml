abstract: Deletion of the distal region of chromosome 1 frequently occurs in a variety
  of human cancers, including aggressive neuroblastoma. Previously, we have identified
  a 500-kb homozygously deleted region at chromosome 1p36.2 harboring at least six
  genes in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line NB1 C201. Among them, only KIF1Bbeta,
  a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins, induced apoptotic cell death. These
  results prompted us to address whether KIF1Bbeta could be a tumor suppressor gene
  mapped to chromosome 1p36 in neuroblastoma. Hemizygous deletion of KIF1Bbeta in
  primary neuroblastomas was significantly correlated with advanced stages p 0.0013
  and MYCN amplification p lt 0.001 , whereas the mutation rate of the KIF1Bbeta gene
  was infrequent. Although KIF1Bbeta allelic loss was significantly associated with
  a decrease in KIF1Bbeta mRNA levels, its promoter region was not hypermethylated.
  Additionally, expression of KIF1Bbeta was markedly down-regulated in advanced stages
  of tumors p lt 0.001 . Enforced expression of KIF1Bbeta resulted in an induction
  of apoptotic cell death in association with an increase in the number of cells entered
  into the G2 M phase of the cell cycle, whereas its knockdown by either short interfering
  RNA or by a genetic suppressor element led to an accelerated cell proliferation
  or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated
  that the rod region unique to KIF1Bbeta is critical for the induction of apoptotic
  cell death in a p53-independent manner. Thus, KIF1Bbeta may act as a haploinsufficient
  tumor suppressor, and its allelic loss may be involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma
  and other cancers.
