abstract: Illumina Infinium whole genome genotyping WGG arrays are increasingly being
  applied in cancer genomics to study gene copy number alterations and allele-specific
  aberrations such as loss-of-heterozygosity LOH . Methods developed for normalization
  of WGG arrays have mostly focused on diploid, normal samples. However, for cancer
  samples genomic aberrations may confound normalization and data interpretation.
  Therefore, we examined the effects of the conventionally used normalization method
  for Illumina Infinium arrays when applied to cancer samples.
