abstract: Pheochromocytomas PCC are catecholamine-producing tumors arising from the
  adrenal medulla that occur either sporadically or in the context of hereditary cancer
  syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 MEN2 , von Hippel-Lindau
  disease VHL , neurofibromatosis type 1, and the PCC-paraganglioma syndrome. Conventional
  comparative genomic hybridization studies have shown loss of 1p and 3q in the majority
  of sporadic and MEN2-related PCC, and 3p and 11p loss in VHL-related PCC. The development
  of a submegabase tiling resolution array enabled us to perform a genome-wide high-resolution
  analysis of 36 sporadic benign PCC. The results show that there are two distinct
  patterns of abnormalities in these sporadic PCC, one consisting of loss of 1p with
  or without concomitant 3q loss in 20 36 cases 56 , the other characterized by loss
  of 3p with or without concomitant 11p loss in 11 36 31 . In addition, we found loss
  of chromosome 22q at high frequency 35 , as well as the novel finding of high frequency
  chromosome 21q loss 21 . We conclude that there appear to be two subgroups of benign
  sporadic PCC, one of which has a pattern of chromosomal abnormalities that is comparable
  with PCC from patients with MEN2 and the other that is comparable with the PCC that
  arise in patients with VHL disease. In addition, genes on 21q and 22q might play
  a more important role in PCC pathogenesis than had been assumed thus far.
