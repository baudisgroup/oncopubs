abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphoma CLL is an extremely rare disease during
  childhood. We report a 16-year-old female who presented with lymphadenopathies and
  she was diagnosed as T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Her chemotherapy response was
  minimal and clinical findings were unusual. Therefore, her biopsy specimen was re-examined
  and diagnosis was changed to CLL. Chemotherapy protocol including fludarabine, cyclophosphamide,
  rituximab was administrated and good response was observed. In our patient deletion
  at 1q21.2 region that includes aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator ARNT
  gene was detected via comparative genomic hybridization method. ARNT gene deletion
  may be a new mutation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia development. Pediatr Blood
