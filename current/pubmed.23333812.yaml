abstract: Genetic alterations of the short arm of chromosome 9 are frequent in acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia. We performed targeted sequencing of 9p region in 35 adolescent
  and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and sought to investigate the sensitivity
  of detecting copy number alterations in comparison with array comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH , and besides, to detect novel genetic anomalies. We found a
  high concordance of copy number variations CNVs as detected by next generation sequencing
  NGS and aCGH. By both methodologies, the recurrent deletion at CDKN2A B locus was
  identified, whereas NGS revealed additional, small regions of CNVs, seen more frequently
  in adult patients, while aCGH was better at detecting larger CNVs. Also, by NGS,
  we detected novel structural variations, novel SNVs and small insertion deletion
  variants. Our results show that NGS, in addition to detecting mutations and other
  genetic aberrations, can be used to study CNVs.
