abstract: Combined analysis of gene expression array data and array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization data have been used in a series of 26 pediatric brain tumors
  to define up- and downregulated genes that coincide with losses, gains, and amplifications
  involving specific chromosome regions. Frequent losses were defined in chromosome
  arms 3q, 6q, 8p, 10q, 16q, 17p, and gains were identified in chromosome 7, and chromosome
  arms 9p and 17q. Amplification of a 2p region was seen in only one tumor, which
  corresponded to increased expression of the MYCN and DDX1 genes. To facilitate the
  analysis of the two data sets, we have developed a custom overlay tool that defines
  genes that are underexpressed in regions of deletions and overexpressed in regions
  of gain, across the genome and specifically within regions showing recurrent involvement
  in medulloblastomas.
