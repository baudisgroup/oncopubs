abstract: Although acquired uniparental disomy aUPD has been reported in relapse acute
  myeloid leukemia AML , pretransplant aUPD involving chromosome 6 is poorly documented.
  Such events could be of interest because loss of heterozygosity LOH resulting from
  aUPD in leukemic cells may lead to erroneous results if HLA typing for hematopoietic
  stem cell donor searches is performed on blood samples drawn during blastic crisis.
  We report here six AML patients whose HLA typing was performed on DNA extracted
  from peripheral blood obtained at diagnosis. We observed LOH involving the entire
  HLA region three patients , HLA-A, B, C two patients and HLA-A only one patient
  . An array-comparative genomic hybridization showed that copy number was neutral
  for all loci, thus revealing partial aUPD of chromosome 6p21. When HLA typing was
  performed on remission blood samples both haplotypes were detected. A 3-4 LOH incidence
  was estimated in AML patients with high blast counts. Based on DNA mixing experiments,
  we determined by PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization on microbeads
  arrays a detection threshold for HLA-A, B, DRB1 heterozygosity in blood samples
  with amp lt 80 blasts. Because aUPD may be partial, any homozygous HLA result should
  be confirmed by a second typing performed on buccal swabs or on blood samples from
  the patient in remission.
