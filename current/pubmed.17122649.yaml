abstract: Longstanding ulcerative colitis UC is associated with a high risk of developing
  UC-related colonic adenocarcinoma UCC . These carcinomas originate from nonadenomatous
  dysplastic regions referred to as dysplasia associated lesion or mass DALM . We
  evaluated chromosomal and microsatellite instability MSI in 21 DALM UCCs. Chromosomal
  instability was determined by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
  with a 3500-element BAC-PAC array. MSI was assessed with markers BAT25 and BAT26
  and by immunohistochemical analysis of mismatch repair genes. Comparative genomic
  hybridization revealed frequent losses of array clones amp gt 20 of tumors at chromosome
  arms 4p, 5q, and 18q, frequent gains of array clones amp gt 20 of tumors were found
  at 1q, 5p, 6p, 7p, 7q, 8p, 8q, 11p, 11q, 12q, 14q, 17q, 19q, 20p, and 20q. The pattern
  of alterations is dominated by gains on 5p and 20q with loss of 4p, all of which
  were already present in a patient with carcinoma in situ. Immunohistochemical analysis
  of mismatch repair genes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 showed negative immunostaining
  in 1 neoplasm 5 . MSI of BAT25 and BAT26 was seen in 3 tumors 14 including the neoplasm
  with aberrant immunostaining. In conclusion, we constructed a genomic profile of
  DALM UCC including several novel genetic alterations. Further, we found a low percentage
  of MSI. Thus, DALM UCCs display profound chromosomal instability, but this is not
  associated with concurrent MSI.
