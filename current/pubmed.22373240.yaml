abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The number of circulating tumor cells CTCs in metastatic prostate
  cancer patients provides prognostic and predictive information. However, it is the
  molecular characterization of CTCs that offers insight into the biology of these
  tumor cells in the context of personalized treatment. METHODS: We developed a novel
  approach to isolate CTCs away from hematopoietic cells with high purity, enabling
  genomic analysis of these cells. The isolation protocol involves immunomagnetic
  enrichment followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting IE FACS . To evaluate
  the feasibility of isolation of CTCs by IE FACS and downstream genomic profiling,
  we conducted a pilot study in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate
  cancer CRPC . Twenty 20 sequential CRPC patients were assayed using CellSearch.
  Twelve 12 patients positive for CTCs were subjected to immunomagnetic enrichment
  and fluorescence activated cell sorting IE FACS to isolate CTCs. Genomic DNA of
  CTCs was subjected to whole genome amplification WGA followed by gene copy number
  analysis via array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . RESULTS: CTCs from nine
  9 patients successfully profiled were observed to have multiple copy number aberrations
  including those previously reported in primary prostate tumors such as gains in
  8q and losses in 8p. High-level copy number gains at the androgen receptor AR locus
  were observed in 7 78 cases. Comparison of genomic profiles between CTCs and archival
  primary tumors from the same patients revealed common lineage. However, high-level
  copy number gains in the AR locus were observed in CTCs, but not in the matched
  archival primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new approach to isolate prostate
  CTCs without significant leukocyte admixture, and to subject them to genome-wide
  copy number analysis. Our assay may be utilized to explore genomic events involved
  in cancer progression, e.g. development of castration resistance and to monitor
  therapeutic efficacy of targeted therapies in clinical trials in a relatively non-invasive
  manner.'
