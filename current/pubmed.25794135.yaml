abstract: "In this study, we analyzed the prevalence and clone size of BRAF V600E
  mutation in 209 patients with multiple myeloma and related the results to clinical
  phenotype, response and survival. Biopsies were screened for BRAF V600E by allele-specific
  real-time PCR (AS-PCR). Positive results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry,
  Sanger sequencing and, in three patients from whom we had stored purified myeloma
  cells, whole-exome sequencing. Eleven patients (5.3%) were BRAF V600E mutation positive
  by AS-PCR and at least one other method. The fraction of mutated cells varied from
  4 to 100%. BRAF V600E-positive patients had no characteristic clinical phenotype
  except for significantly higher levels of serum creatinine (125 versus 86â\x80\x89Î¼mol/l)
  Seven of eleven patients responded with at least very good partial response to alkylators,
  immunomodulatory agents or proteasome inhibitors. Progression-free and overall survival
  were similar in patients with and without the mutation. By this integrated approach,
  we found that patients with BRAF V600E mutation responded very well to broad acting
  drugs and there was no relation to prognosis in early-stage myeloma. In particular,
  a large mutated cell fraction did not correlate with aggressive disease."
