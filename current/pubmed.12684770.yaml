abstract: Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia is the only known precursor lesion of lung
  adenocarcinomas ACs so far. Here, we describe a new dysplastic lesion in the bronchioles
  of peripheral lung for which we propose the name bronchiolar columnar cell dysplasia
  BCCD . Eight of fourteen BCCDs were successfully analyzed by means of comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . The average number of chromosomal aberrations was 2.6
  in BCCD and 14.7 in concomitant AC. Among the aberrations were losses of 3p, 9,
  13, 14 and gains of 1q, 17, 19q and 20q. Summarizing our data from morphological
  and genetic analysis, we conclude that BCCD is a preneoplasia of the bronchiolar
  epithelium and most probably represents an additional precursor lesion of lung adenocarcinomas.
