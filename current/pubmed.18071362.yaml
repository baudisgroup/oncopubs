abstract: The initiating somatic genetic events in chordoma development have not yet
  been identified. Most cytogenetically investigated chordomas have displayed near-diploid
  or moderately hypodiploid karyotypes, with several numerical and structural rearrangements.
  However, no consistent structural chromosome aberration has been reported. This
  is the first array-based study characterising DNA copy number changes in chordoma.
  Array comparative genomic hybridisation aCGH identified copy number alterations
  in all samples and imbalances affecting 5 or more out of the 21 investigated tumours
  were seen on all chromosomes. In general, deletions were more common than gains
  and no high-level amplification was found, supporting previous findings of primarily
  losses of large chromosomal regions as an important mechanism in chordoma development.
  Although small imbalances were commonly found, the vast majority of these were detected
  in single cases no small deletion affecting all tumours could be discerned. However,
  the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci in 9p21 were homo- or heterozygously lost in 70 of the
  tumours, a finding corroborated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, suggesting
  that inactivation of these genes constitute an important step in chordoma development.
