abstract: For years, the genetics of metastatic colorectal cancer CRC have been studied
  using a variety of techniques. However, most of the approaches employed so far have
  a relatively limited resolution which hampers detailed characterization of the common
  recurrent chromosomal breakpoints as well as the identification of small regions
  carrying genetic changes and the genes involved in them.
