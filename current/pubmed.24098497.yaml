abstract: 'The interplay between copy number variation (CNV) and differential gene
  expression may be able to shed light on molecular process underlying breast cancer
  and lead to the discovery of cancer-related genes. In the current study, genes concurrently
  identified in array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene expression
  microarrays were used to derive gene signatures for Han Chinese breast cancers.
  We performed 23 array CGHs and 81 gene expression microarrays in breast cancer samples
  from Taiwanese women. Genes with coherent patterns of both CNV and differential
  gene expression were identified from the 21 samples assayed using both platforms.
  We used these genes to derive signatures associated with clinical ER and HER2 status
  and disease-free survival. DISTRIBUTIONS OF SIGNATURE GENES WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED
  WITH CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION: chromosome 16 for ER and 17 for HER2. A breast cancer
  risk predictive model was built based on the first supervised principal component
  from 16 genes (RCAN3, MCOLN2, DENND2D, RWDD3, ZMYM6, CAPZA1, GPR18, WARS2, TRIM45,
  SCRN1, CSNK1E, HBXIP, CSDE1, MRPL20, IKZF1, and COL20A1), and distinct survival
  patterns were observed between the high- and low-risk groups from the combined dataset
  of 408 microarrays. The risk score was significantly higher in breast cancer patients
  with recurrence, metastasis, or mortality than in relapse-free individuals (0.241
  versus 0, P<0.001). The concurrent gene risk predictive model remained discriminative
  across distinct clinical ER and HER2 statuses in subgroup analysis. Prognostic comparisons
  with published gene expression signatures showed a better discerning ability of
  concurrent genes, many of which were rarely identifiable if expression data were
  pre-selected by phenotype correlations or variability of individual genes. We conclude
  that parallel analysis of CGH and microarray data, in conjunction with known gene
  expression patterns, can be used to identify biomarkers with prognostic values in
  breast cancer.'
