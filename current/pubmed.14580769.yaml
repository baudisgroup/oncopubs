abstract: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia T-PLL is a rare postthymic T-cell disorder
  that may show different morphologic variants and a very aggressive clinical behavior.
  On occasion, patients may present with an indolent clinical course and long survival.
  The disease is genetically characterized by the presence of complex karyotypes with
  recurrent alterations involving chromosomes 8, 14, and 11. The possible relationship
  between genetic alterations and morphologic variants and the clinical course of
  the disease, however, is not well known. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was
  used to detect chromosomal imbalances in eight patients diagnosed with T-PLL, including
  three cases of small-cell variant with an indolent clinical evolution. Abnormal
  profiles were detected in all cases. The chromosomal regions most often over-represented
  were 8q 75 , 5p 62 , and 14q 37 , as well as 6p and 21 both 25 . The chromosomal
  regions most often underrepresented were 8p and 11q 75 , 13q 37 , and 6q, 7q, 16q,
  17p, and 17q 25 . The number of chromosomal imbalances in the three small-cell variants
  was relatively similar to that of cases with typical morphology. Only gains of 6p
  and losses of 7q present in three and two cases, respectively, with typical morphology
  were not detected in any small-cell variant. CGH analysis revealed alterations in
  15 chromosomal regions not detected by conventional cytogenetics. These results
  indicate that T-PLL carry a high number of chromosomal alterations that are not
  related to the morphologic variants or the clinical behavior of the disease.
