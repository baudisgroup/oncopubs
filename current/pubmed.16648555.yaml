abstract: Chromosome rearrangement, a hallmark of cancer, has profound effects on
  carcinogenesis and tumor phenotype. We used a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines
  the NCI-60 as a model system to identify relationships among DNA copy number, mRNA
  expression level, and drug sensitivity. For each of 64 cancer-relevant genes, we
  calculated all 4,096 possible Pearsons correlation coefficients relating DNA copy
  number assessed by comparative genomic hybridization using bacterial artificial
  chromosome microarrays and mRNA expression level determined using both cDNA and
  Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays . The analysis identified an association
  of ERBB2 overexpression with 3p copy number, a finding supported by data from human
  tumors and a mouse model of ERBB2-induced carcinogenesis. When we examined the correlation
  between DNA copy number for all 353 unique loci on the bacterial artificial chromosome
  microarray and drug sensitivity for 118 drugs with putatively known mechanisms of
  action, we found a striking negative correlation -0.983 95 bootstrap confidence
  interval, -0.999 to -0.899 between activity of the enzyme drug L-asparaginase and
  DNA copy number of genes near asparagine synthetase in the ovarian cancer cells.
  Previous analysis of drug sensitivity and mRNA expression had suggested an inverse
  relationship between mRNA levels of asparagine synthetase and L-asparaginase sensitivity
  in the NCI-60. The concordance of pharmacogenomic findings at the DNA and mRNA levels
  strongly suggests further study of L-asparaginase for possible treatment of a low-synthetase
  subset of clinical ovarian cancers. The DNA copy number database presented here
  will enable other investigators to explore DNA transcript-drug relationships in
  their own domains of research focus.
