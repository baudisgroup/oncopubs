abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma AdCC is a rare form of triple-negative and basal-like
  breast cancer that has an indolent clinical behaviour. Four breast AdCCs were recently
  shown to harbour the recurrent chromosomal translocation t 6 9 q22-23 p23-24 , which
  leads to the formation of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene. Our aims were i to determine
  the prevalence of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene in AdCCs of the breast ii to characterize
  the gene copy number aberrations found in AdCCs and iii to determine whether AdCCs
  are genomically distinct from histological grade-matched or triple-negative and
  basal-like invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type IDC-NSTs . The presence
  of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene was investigated in 13 AdCCs of the breast by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH and reverse transcriptase-PCR RT-PCR , and MYB and BRCA1
  RNA expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Fourteen AdCCs, 14 histological
  grade-matched IDC-NSTs, and 14 IDC-NSTs of triple-negative and basal-like phenotype
  were microdissected and subjected to high-resolution microarray-based comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH . The MYB-NFIB fusion gene was detected in all but one
  AdCC. aCGH analysis demonstrated a relatively low number of copy number aberrations
  and a lack of recurrent amplifications in breast AdCCs. Contrary to grade-matched
  IDC-NSTs, AdCCs lacked 1q gains and 16q losses, and in contrast with basal-like
  IDC-NSTs, AdCCs displayed fewer gene copy number aberrations and expressed MYB and
  BRCA1 at significantly higher levels. Breast AdCCs constitute an entity distinct
  from grade-matched and triple-negative and basal-like IDC-NSTs, emphasizing the
  importance of histological subtyping of triple-negative and basal-like breast carcinomas.
