abstract: The authors describe the case of a patient with a glioblastoma multiforme
  who showed remarkably good response to chemotherapy. A genetic analysis using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH revealed that the tumor had a gain on the q arm of chromosome
  1 1q . Using CGH for a series of genetic analyses of more than 180 patients with
  gliomas, six were found to have a demonstrated 1q gain. Although the tumors in all
  six of these cases were histopathologically diagnosed as high-grade gliomas, compared
  with other malignant gliomas they demonstrated a good prognosis because of their
  favorable chemotherapeutic sensitivity. In immunohistochemical tests, most of the
  tumor cells in these cases were negative for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase,
  which antagonizes the effect of DNA-alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The authors
  believed that a gain of 1q could be produced through the genetic events that cause
  loss of 1p, because these chromosomal aberrations have an imbalance of DNA copy
  number in common 1p amp lt 1q . A gain of 1q is an infrequent chromosomal aberration
  and its clinical importance should be investigated in a larger study however, patients
  with malignant gliomas demonstrating a 1q gain possibly show longer survival and
  good response to chemotherapy similar to patients with tumors demonstrating 1p loss.
  The importance of using genetic analysis for gliomas is emphasized in this report
  because it may help in selecting cases responsive to chemotherapy and because appropriate
  treatment for these patients will lead to progress in the treatment of malignant
  gliomas.
