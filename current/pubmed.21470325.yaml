abstract: 'We recently reported that the vast majority amp gt 90 of low-grade diffuse
  gliomas diffuse astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma and oligodendroglioma carry at least
  one of the following genetic alterations: IDH1 2 mutation, TP53 mutation or 1p 19q
  loss. Only 7 of cases were triple-negative ie, lacking any of these alterations
  . In the present study, array comparative genomic hybridization CGH in 15 triple-negative
  WHO grade II gliomas eight diffuse astrocytomas and seven oligodendrogliomas showed
  loss at 9p21 p14 ARF , p15 INK4b , p16 INK4a loci and 13q14-13q32 containing the
  RB1 locus in three and two cases, respectively. Further analyses in 31 triple-negative
  cases as well as a total of 160 non-triple-negative cases revealed that alterations
  in the RB1 pathway homozygous deletion and promoter methylation of the p15 INK4b
  , p16 INK4a and RB1 genes were significantly more frequent in triple-negative 26
  than in non-triple-negative cases 11 P  0.0371 . Multivariate analysis after adjustment
  for age, histology and treatment showed that RB1 pathway alterations were significantly
  associated with unfavorable outcome for patients with low-grade diffuse glioma hazard
  ratio, 3.024 1.279-6.631 P  0.0057 . These results suggest that a fraction of low-grade
  diffuse gliomas lacking common genetic alterations may develop through a distinct
  genetic pathway, which may include loss of cell-cycle control regulated by the RB1
  pathway.'
