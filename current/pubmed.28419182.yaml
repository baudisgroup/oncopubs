abstract: "Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) is a rare disease with poor prognosis
  and with strong inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. However, molecular classification
  is currently focused on activating MET mutations. We sought to better characterize
  the molecular diversity of SC using mutational signatures that reflect different
  mutational processes, such as tobacco-associated adducts (signature 4), BRCA1/BRCA2
  deficiency (signature 3) or APOBEC enzyme deamination (signatures 2&13).Whole-exome
  sequencing was performed in 15 SC patients and on data from 10 previously-published
  cases. Hierarchical clustering and consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
  were performed for classification, based on mutational signatures.In the two series,
  we identified two clusters (C): C sig4 (characterized by signature 4) and C sig2-3-13
  (signatures 2, 3, and 13). C sig4 exhibited more frequent MAPK pathway mutations
  than C sig2-3-13 (pooled series: nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x8910/14 vs. 2/11, P <.05 , respectively)
  and stronger PD-L1 expression (our series: nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x896/9 vs. 1/6, P =.12).
  MET alterations were only found in C sig2-3-13 (pooled series: nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x895/11
  vs. 0/14, P =.009), as well as BRCA1 / BRCA2 (nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x893/11 vs. 0/15),
  EGFR (nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x891), and IDH1 ( nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x891 ) mutations. C sig2-3-13
  patients had better overall survival than C sig4 patients (median: >45 months vs.
  7 months, respectively, P=.001).Our study suggests that SC presents at least two
  clusters comprising different mutational processes, gene alterations, and PD-L1
  expression. New potential treatment possibilities are immune checkpoint inhibitors
  in C sig4 and specific targeted agents in C sig2-3-13 . These findings should encourage
  clinicians to conduct broad molecular and immunological testing in SC patients beyond
  MET exon 14 alterations."
