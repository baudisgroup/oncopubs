abstract: Copy number abnormalities CNAs in tumor cells are presumed to affect expression
  levels of genes located in region of abnormality. To investigate this relationship
  we have surveyed the losses, gains and amplifications in 30 glioblastomas using
  array comparative genome hybridization and compared these data with gene expression
  changes in the same tumors using the Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 oligonucleotide arrays.
  The two datasets were overlaid using our in-house overlay tool which highlights
  concordance between CNAs and expression level changes for the same tumors. In this
  survey we have highlighted genes frequently overexpressed in amplified regions on
  chromosomes 1, 4, 11, and 12 and have identified novel amplicons on these chromosomes.
  Deletions of specific regions on chromosomes 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15 have also been
  correlated with reduced gene expression in the regions of minimal overlap. In addition
  we describe a novel approach for comparing gene expression levels between tumors
  based on the presence or absence of chromosome CNAs. This genome wide screen provides
  an efficient and comprehensive survey of genes which potentially serve as the drivers
  for the CNAs in GBM.
