abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas HNSCC have been causally associated
  with tobacco and alcohol exposure. However, 10-15 of HNSCC develop in absence of
  significant carcinogen exposure. Several lines of evidence suggest that the genetic
  composition of HNSCC varies based on the extent of tobacco alcohol exposure, however,
  no genome wide measures have been applied to address this issue. We used comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to screen for the genetic aberrations in 71 patients with
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and stratified the findings by the status
  of tobacco alcohol exposure.
