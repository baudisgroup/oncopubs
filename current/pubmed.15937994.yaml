abstract: Carcinomas are believed to develop by incremental steps of increasingly
  abnormal morphology driven by accumulating somatic genetic changes. This process
  is often difficult to study, as the early stages are undetectable. We used fluorescence
  bronchoscopy, which enhances detection of preinvasive bronchial lesions, and have
  obtained sequential biopsies of carcinoma in situ CIS from a patient with no detectable
  tumor and from a squamous cell carcinoma that developed 19 months after presentation
  at the site of one of the previous CIS lesions. Biopsies of preinvasive CIS, which
  follow-up showed had different pathologic outcomes, and tumor were microdissected
  to obtain enriched cell populations and DNA prepared from them. Molecular characteristics
  of these biopsies were compared by loss of heterozygosity analysis, TP53 mutation
  analysis, and comparative genomic hybridization. Although all lesions examined had
  the same TP53 mutation and almost identical allelotypes, differences were observed.
  Loss in 5q21 and amplification of 3q25-26 were associated with the lesion that progressed
  and the subsequent carcinoma. Allele loss at 4p16 was detected in the tumor but
  not in any of the CIS lesions, suggesting it was a late event associated with tumor
  invasion. Amplification at 4q12 was specifically observed in the tumor and in the
  CIS at the site of eventual tumor formation. Although these findings may be unique
  to this one patient, the successful demonstration of sequential genetic changes
  raises the possibility that this approach, unencumbered by interpatient variability
  between lesions, will greatly facilitate the identification of molecular events
  driving the invasive process
