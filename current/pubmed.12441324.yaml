abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that ingestion of arsenic in drinking
  water is a strong risk factor for several forms of cancer, including bladder cancer.
  It is not known whether arsenic-related cancers are genetically similar to cancers
  in unexposed individuals or what mechanisms of carcinogenesis may underlie their
  formation. This study was designed to compare chromosomal alterations in bladder
  cancers of arsenic-exposed individuals to provide insight into the mechanism of
  how arsenic may induce or promote cancer.
