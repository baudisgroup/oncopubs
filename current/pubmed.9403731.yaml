abstract: Unexpectedly aggressive clinical course of some grade II astrocytomas is
  a diagnostic dilemma for routine histopathology. Because increasing tumor malignancy
  is a consequence of progressive accumulation of chromosomal alterations, we investigated
  whether aggressive behavior of grade II astrocytomas could be predicted by the number
  and type of gross chromosomal aberrations. We used comparative genomic hybridization
  to analyze 11 grade II astrocytomas with typical good, n 7 or poor n 4 prognosis.
  The results were also compared with a reference material of 13 grade III-IV astrocytomas
  and nine established cell lines. We found a median of two aberrations range 0 to
  4 in tumors with good prognosis and of 15.5 changes range 8 to 28 in tumors with
  poor prognosis. Chromosomal gains were present in both groups, whereas chromosomal
  losses were frequent in tumors with poor prognosis median 9.5, range 3 to 14 but
  rare in tumors with good prognosis range 0 to 2 . All chromosomal gains were also
  found in the high-grade astrocytoma group and the majority of them in cell lines.
  Chromosomal losses in grade II astrocytomas with poor prognosis were very similar
  to those in grade III-IV astrocytomas and cell lines. We conclude that an early
  accumulation of genetic changes in grade II astrocytomas is closely associated with
  poor patient prognosis, suggesting diagnostic use for comparative genomic hybridization
  in characterization of grade II astrocytomas.
