abstract: Cancers may be composed of multiple populations of submodal clones sharing
  the same initiating genetic lesions, followed by the acquisition of divergent genetic
  hits. Intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity has profound implications for cancer clinical
  management. To determine the extent of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity in breast
  cancers, and whether the morphological diversity of breast cancers is underpinned
  by divergent genetic aberrations, we analysed the genomic profiles of microdissected,
  morphologically distinct components of six metaplastic breast carcinomas, tumours
  characterized by the presence of morphological areas with divergent differentiation.
  Each morphologically distinct component was separately microdissected and subjected
  to high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Each component
  was also analysed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Clonal relationship
  between the distinct components was tested by TP53 sequencing and human androgen
  receptor HUMARA X-chromosome inactivation assay. In the majority of cases, all morphologically
  distinct components from each case were clonal and displayed remarkably similar
  genetic profiles. In two cases, however, morphologically distinct components harboured
  specific genetic aberrations. In an adenosquamous carcinoma, the differences were
  such that only 20 of the genome harboured similar copy number changes. The squamous
  component displayed EGFR gene amplification, EGFR over-expression and lack of expression
  of hormone receptors, whereas the lobular component displayed the reverse pattern.
  The components of a biphasic spindle cell carcinoma harboured similar gains, losses,
  amplifications of 9p23 and 17q12 HER2 and identical TP53 mutations, suggesting that
  these were relatively early events in the development of this tumour however, each
  component displayed divergent focal amplifications. Importantly, the metastatic
  deposit of this case, despite harbouring a TP53 mutation identical to that found
  in the primary tumour, harboured additional specific focal amplifications. This
  proof-of-principle study provides direct evidence of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity
  in breast cancers, and shows that in some cases morphological diversity may be underpinned
  by distinct genetic aberrations.
