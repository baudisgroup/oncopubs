abstract: Ovarian granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are the most frequent sex cord-stromal
  tumors. Several studies have shown that a somatic mutation leading to a C134W substitution
  in the transcription factor FOXL2 appears in more than 95% of adult-type GCTs. Its
  pervasive presence suggests that FOXL2 is the main cancer driver gene. However,
  other mutations and genomic changes might also contribute to tumor formation and/or
  progression.  We have performed a combined comparative genomic hybridization and
  transcriptomic analyses of 10 adult-type GCTs to obtain a picture of the genomic
  landscape of this cancer type and to identify new candidate co-driver genes.  Our
  results, along with a review of previous molecular studies, show the existence of
  highly recurrent chromosomal imbalances (especially, trisomy 14 and monosomy 22)
  and preferential co-occurrences (i.e. trisomy 14/monosomy 22 and trisomy 7/monosomy
  16q). In-depth analyses showed the presence of recurrently broken, amplified/duplicated
  or deleted genes. Many of these genes, such as AKT1, RUNX1 and LIMA1, are known
  to be involved in cancer and related processes. Further genomic explorations suggest
  that they are functionally related.  Our combined analysis identifies potential
  candidate genes, whose alterations might contribute to adult-type GCT formation/progression
  together with the recurrent FOXL2 somatic mutation.
