abstract: 'The pathogenesis of pediatric central nervous system tumors is poorly understood.
  To increase knowledge about the genetic mechanisms underlying these tumors, we performed
  genome-wide screening of 17 pediatric gliomas and embryonal tumors combining G-band
  karyotyping and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). G-banding revealed
  abnormal karyotypes in 56% of tumor samples (9 of 16; one failed in culture), whereas
  aCGH found copy number aberrations in all 13 tumors examined. Pilocytic astrocytomas
  (n = 3) showed normal karyotypes or nonrecurrent translocations by karyotyping but
  the well-established recurrent gain of 7q34 and 19p13.3 by aCGH. Our series included
  one anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, a tumor type not previously characterized genomically
  in children, and one anaplastic neuroepithelial tumor (probably an oligoastrocytoma);
  both showed loss of chromosome 14 by G-banding and structural aberrations of 6q
  and loss of 14q, 17p, and 22q by aCGH. Three of five supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal
  tumors showed aberrant karyotypes: two were near-diploid with mainly structural
  changes and one was near-triploid with several trisomies. aCGH confirmed these findings
  and revealed additional recurrent gains of 1q21-44 and losses of 3p21, 3q26, and
  8p23. We describe cytogenetically for the first time a cribriform neuroepithelial
  tumor, a recently identified variant of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor with a
  favorable prognosis, which showed loss of 1p33, 4q13.2, 10p12.31, 10q11.22, and
  22q by aCGH. This study indicates the existence of distinct cytogenetic patterns
  in pediatric gliomas and embryonal tumors; however, further studies of these rare
  tumors using a multimodal approach are required before their true genomic aberration
  pattern can be finally established.  Copyright ï¿½ 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.'
