abstract: The analysis of nucleic acids is limited by the availability of archival
  specimens and the quality and amount of the extracted material. Archived cytogenetic
  preparations are stored in many laboratories and are a potential source of total
  genomic DNA for array karyotyping and other applications. Array CGH using DNA from
  fixed cytogenetic preparations has been described, but it is not known whether it
  can be used for SNP arrays. Diagnostic bone marrow specimens taken during the assessment
  of hematological malignancies are also a potential source of DNA, but it is generally
  assumed that DNA must be extracted, or the specimen frozen, within a day or two
  of collection, to obtain DNA suitable for further analysis. We have assessed DNA
  extracted from these materials for both SNP array and array CGH.
