abstract: It is widely accepted that both large-scale chromosomal abnormalities and
  mutation of specific genes, such as APC, K-ras, and or p53, occur in the majority
  of colorectal adenocarcinomas. Whether or not a relationship exists between these
  different forms of genetic abnormalities was previously unknown. Using comparative
  genomic hybridization and mutational analysis of APC, K-ras, and p53 to evaluate
  50 colorectal adenocarcinomas, we have shown that mutation of p53 is significantly
  associated with gain of 20q, 13q, and 8q and loss of 18q P 0.000, 0.02, 0.044, and
  0.001, respectively . Conversely, APC mutation did not associate with any of the
  above-mentioned aberrations but did associate significantly with gain of 7p P 0.01
  . Gain of chromosomal arm 12p, although a less common aberration, was significantly
  associated with K-ras mutation P 0.011 . The associations we have described should
  refine the search for candidate genes underlying chromosomal aberrations and assist
  in the definition of distinct pathways in colorectal tumorigenesis.
