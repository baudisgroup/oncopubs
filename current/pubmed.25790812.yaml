abstract: To determine genetic features of a pediatric uveal melanoma in a 6-year-old
  girl by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) and assess prognosis,
  and to search for constitutional copy number variations (CNVs) encompassing oncosuppressor
  genes.  High-resolution a-CGH was performed on genomic DNA from cancer cells and
  from peripheral blood cells. Histopathology and clinical staging of the tumor were
  simultaneously assessed.  Array-based CGH revealed no CNVs on tumor cells associated
  with poor prognosis; namely, no monosomy 3, losses of 1p, 6q, or 8p, and no gains
  of 8q. A unique genomic profile was observed, consisting mainly of partial terminal
  duplications affecting chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, and 19, and complete
  trisomy of chromosomes 6, 7, and 20. The nonmetastatic tumor had predominantly epithelioid
  histology. No constitutional CNVs encompassing oncosuppressor genes were detected.  We
  report a very rare uveal melanoma characterized by low-risk genomic profile and
  poor prognostic histologic and clinical features. The child is relapse-free at 1-year
  follow-up. The unusual CNVs detected by a-CGH suggest specific pathogenic mechanisms.
