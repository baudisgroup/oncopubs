abstract: Hepatic adenoma HA and focal nodular hyperplasia FNH are two common non-malignant
  tumors of the liver. Genomic analysis on these benign lesions may shed light on
  the genetic mechanism underlying liver carcinogenesis. We used comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to evaluate genomic changes in eight cases of HA and six cases
  of FNH, obtained by surgical procedures the resulting chromosomal aberration profiles
  were analyzed together with their pathological and clinical manifestations. We found
  consistent chromosomal lesions associated with both non-malignant hepatic tumors.
  The overall genomic abnormalities in HA and FNH were much less obvious than those
  in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC . Among these limited changes, frequent gains were
  located on chromosomal arms 1q 50 , 17q 50 , 1p 38 , and 11q 38 in HA, and on 11q
  50 , 9q 33 , 17q 33 , and 22q 33 in FNH. Gains outnumbered losses, and HA contained
  more CGH abnormalities than did FNH. Interestingly, CGH alteration hotspots found
  in HA, but not in FNH, appeared largely to coincide with common genomic lesions
  of cancerous HCC, suggesting an interesting relationship along the tumorigenesis
  pathway of HA and HCC.
