abstract: Lung cancer sublines No15-80-1 and No15-80-6 were selected by treatment
  of cell line NCI-H460 with paclitaxel at stepwise increasing concentrations from
  50 nmol L to 800 nmol L. The two sublines exhibited amplifications of the ABCB1
  region previously MDR1 with different copy number profiles, but shared a common
  amplification pattern, which has been observed in amplification mediated by the
  breakage-fusion-bridge BFB cycle. Sequence analysis of the distal ends of the amplified
  regions, which were probably generated in a break-and-fusion of the initial round
  of the BFB cycle, revealed a head-to-head fused sequence of chromosome 7. The sequence
  was identical in the two sublines. A short sequence of 200bp derived from chromosome
  2 was incorporated, suggesting translocation between chromosomes 2 and 7. The copy
  number of the short sequence was comparable to that of the neighboring sequence,
  suggesting coamplification. The timing of the occurrence of the putative translocation
  and the initiation of BFB-cycle-driven amplification during the stepwise selection
  were determined by using the unique junction sequences specific to these events
  as indicators. The results demonstrated that the translocation occurred at the step
  of 100 nmol L treatment and the BFB cycle initiated in the step of 400 nmol L-treatment.
  It is likely that the translocation, preceding amplification by several selection
  steps, activated ABCB1 gene expression. The diversity in amplification profiles
  between the two sublines was generated by the separately operating BFB cycles, after
  an initial break-and-fusion that probably occurred in a single cell.
