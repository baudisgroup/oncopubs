abstract: 'Lung cancer is a serious health problem, since it is one of the leading
  causes for death worldwide. Molecular-cytogenetic studies could provide reliable
  data about genetic alterations which could be related to disease pathogenesis and
  be used for better prognosis and treatment strategies. We performed whole genome
  oligonucleotide microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization in 10 samples
  of non-small cell lung cancer. Trisomies were discovered for chromosomes 1, 13,
  18 and 20. Chromosome arms 5p, 7p, 11q, 20q and Ð¥q were affected by genetic gains,
  and 1p, 5q, 10q and 15q, by genetic losses. Microstructural (<5 Mbp) genomic aberrations
  were revealed: gains in regions 7p (containing the epidermal growth factor receptor
  gene) and 12p (containing KRAS) and losses in 3p26 and 4q34. Based on high amplitude
  of alterations and small overlapping regions, new potential oncogenes may be suggested:
  NBPF4 (1p13.3); ETV1, AGR3 and TSPAN13 (7p21.3-7p21.1); SOX5 and FGFR1OP2 (12p12.1-12p11.22);
  GPC6 (13q32.1). Significant genetic losses were assumed to contain potential tumour-suppressor
  genes: DPYD (1p21.3); CLDN22, CLDN24, ING2, CASP3, SORBS2 (4q34.2-q35.1); DEFB (8p23.1).
  Our results complement the picture of genomic characterization of non-small cell
  lung cancer.'
