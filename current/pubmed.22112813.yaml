abstract: Diagnosing malignancy of adrenocortical tumors ACT and predicting prognosis
  in carcinomas are often challenging. Transcriptome markers have recently emerged,
  providing promising clinical relevance and improved pathophysiological knowledge.
  Whether tumoral chromosomal alterations provide similar information is not known.
  The aim was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of chromosomal alterations
  in ACT and to identify genes associated with benign and malignant tumorigenesis.
