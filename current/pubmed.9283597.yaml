abstract: Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 and MYCN amplification are the
  most frequently encountered genetic changes in disseminated neuroblastomas and neuroblastoma
  cell lines. Different strategies have been followed for detection of these and other
  genomic changes in neuroblastoma including karyotyping, FISH, and LOH, each with
  its own limitations. Here we report upon the evaluation of comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in the analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines, with the emphasis on the assessment
  of the reliability of CGH for the detection of distal 1p deletions. We have analyzed
  seven neuroblastoma cell lines for which the 1p status was previously studied in
  detail using FISH and LOH. Our results show that CGH allows reliable detection of
  distal 1p deletions, including a small interstitial deletion in cell line SK-N-AS.
  Furthermore, CGH also allows the detection of chromosomal imbalance which would
  otherwise remain undetected, and provides useful information for further molecular
  characterization of chromosomal imbalances.
