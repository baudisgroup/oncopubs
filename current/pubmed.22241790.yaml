abstract: Molecular events underlying progression of well-differentiated liposarcoma
  WDLS to dedifferentiated liposarcoma DDLS are poorly defined. This study sought
  to identify copy number alterations CNA associated with dedifferentiation of WDLS,
  with DDLS morphology, and with patient outcomes.
