abstract: 'Seven granular cell tumours GCT were studied by comparative genomic hybridisation.
  These consisted of two cerebral and one pituitary GCT as well as four other central
  nervous system tumours predominantly composed of granular cells one glioblastoma,
  meningioma, ganglioglioma and neurinoma each . DNA copy number changes were found
  in four of seven tumours. Overall, losses mean: 1.0 per tumour were more frequent
  than gains mean: 0.6 per tumour and no high-level gains were found. The only DNA
  copy number change found in two tumours both cerebral GCT was loss of 13q21, while
  the other nine aberrations were only encountered once each: the granular cells of
  one cerebral GCT additionally showed 1p32-pter, 9q33-qter, 20q, -4, and -18q, of
  the glioblastoma 7 and -10, and of the meningioma -1p and -22q, while the pituitary
  GCT, the ganglioglioma and the neurinoma showed no imbalances. Our data suggest
  that a variety of genetic changes are associated with granular cell formation and
  support the notion that GCT are not a distinct tumour entity characterised by specific
  chromosomal imbalances but rather a degenerative phenomenon of cells of various
  origin showing DNA copy number changes akin to the underlying tumour.'
