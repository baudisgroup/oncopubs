abstract: Childhood adrenocortical tumors ACT are rare malignancies, except in southern
  Brazil, where a higher incidence rate is associated to a high frequency of the founder
  R337H TP53 mutation. To date, copy number alterations in these tumors have only
  been analyzed by low-resolution comparative genomic hybridization.
