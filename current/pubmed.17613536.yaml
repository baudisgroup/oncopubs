abstract: Although gain of 1q occurs in 25 of Burkitt lymphomas BLs and 10 of pediatric
  high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALLs , little is known about the
  origin, molecular genetic characteristics and functional outcome of dup 1q in these
  disorders. Ten dup 1q -positive BLs ALLs were investigated by tiling resolution
  32k array CGH analysis, which revealed that the proximal breakpoints in all cases
  were near-centromeric, in eight of them clustering within a 1.4 Mb segment in 1q12-21.1.
  The 1q distal breakpoints were heterogeneous, being more distal in the ALLs than
  in the BLs. The minimally gained segments in the ALLs and BLs were 57.4 Mb dup 1
  q22q32.3 and 35 Mb dup 1 q12q25.2 , respectively. Satellite II DNA on 1q was not
  hypomethylated, as ascertained by Southern blot analyses of 15 BLs ALLs with and
  without gain of 1q, indicating that aberrant methylation was not involved in the
  origin of dup 1q , as previously suggested for other neoplasms with 1q rearrangements.
  Global gene expression analyses revealed that five genes in the minimally 57.4 Mb
  gained region--B4GALT3, DAP3, RGS16, TMEM183A and UCK2--were significantly overexpressed
  in dup 1q -positive ALLs compared with high hyperdiploid ALLs without dup 1q . The
  DAP3 and UCK2 genes were among the most overexpressed genes in the BL case with
  gain of 1q investigated. The DAP3 protein has been reported to be highly expressed
  in invasive glioblastoma multiforme cells, whereas expression of the UCK2 protein
  has been correlated with sensitivity to anticancer drugs. However, involvement of
  these genes in dup 1q -positive ALLs and BLs has previously not been reported.
