abstract: Primary melanoma can recur at the excision site if not excised with a safety
  margin of surrounding uninvolved skin. To characterize the nature of residual melanoma
  in the skin surrounding primary tumors targeted by safety margins, we used array
  comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect
  and spatially map aberrations in the skin adjacent to acral melanomas. Melanocytic
  cells with genetic amplifications in histopathologically normal skin field cells
  were detected exclusively in the epidermis in 84 of 19 cases, with a mean extension
  of 6.1 mm in situ melanomas and 4.5 mm invasive melanomas beyond the histopathological
  margin. Genetic profiling of these field cells indicated that they represent an
  early phase of disease preceding melanoma in situ. The extent of field cells did
  not correlate with tumor depth or diameter, indicating that tumor depth is not suited
  to predict the extent of field cells. These results demonstrate that, on acral sites,
  melanoma field cells extend significantly into seemingly normal skin. These field
  cells provide a plausible explanation for the tendency of certain melanoma types
  to recur locally despite apparently having undergone complete excision.
