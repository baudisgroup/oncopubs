abstract: Pituitary adenomas are common intracranial neoplasms that may be hormone-secreting
  or nonfunctional. Genetic defects associated with some pituitary tumors have been
  identified, although our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains
  incomplete. We have studied 75 sporadic pituitary tumors, representing the major
  clinical subtypes, by comparative genomic hybridization CGH with the aim of assessing
  for DNA copy number changes. CGH revealed chromosomal imbalances in 34 adenomas
  45.3 , whereby gains were 4.9 times more frequently observed than losses. Most of
  the genetic alterations detected by CGH affected entire chromosomes 108 131, 82.4
  . Gain of genetic material was observed predominantly on chromosomes X 24 75, 32
  , 19 12 75, 16 , 12 6 75, 6.7 , 7 and 9 5 75, 6.7 , whereas loss of DNA sequences
  most frequently affected chromosomes 11 4 75, 5.3 , 13 and 10 3 75, 4 . There were
  no significant differences in the CGH results for the individual clinical subtypes
  of pituitary tumors. These results reveal a nonrandom pattern of chromosomal alterations
  in pituitary tumors, in particular gains of entire chromosomes, and this may contribute
  to the development of such neoplasms.
