abstract: 'Fifteen primary pineal germ cell tumors 8 germinomas, 4 mixed teratomas-germinomas,
  2 immature teratomas, and 1 yolk sac tumor and 2 recurrences of the yolk sac tumor
  were studied by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . An average of 1.8 chromosomal
  changes per germinoma 0.5 gains vs 1.3 losses , 5.5 per mixed teratoma-germinoma
  3.0 gains vs 2.5 losses , 3.5 per immature teratoma 2.0 gains vs 1.5 losses , and
  2.0 in the yolk sac tumor 2 gains vs 0 losses were found the first recurrence showed
  7 4 gains vs 3 losses , the second 13 imbalances 8 gains vs 5 losses . The most
  frequent imbalances were gains on 12p 40 , 8q 27 , and 1q 20 as well as losses on
  13q 47 , 18q 33 , 9q and 11q 20 each . Among germinomas, the most common chromosomal
  changes were -13q and -18q 38 each , in mixed teratomas-germinomas 8q 100 , 12p
  75 , -13q 75 and -9q 50 . Seven high-level gains were identified: 5 in mixed teratomas-germinomas
  8q: 3 cases, 12p: 2 cases , 1 each in a germinoma 2p and an immature teratoma 12p
  . Minimal common regions of over- and underrepresentation were found on 8q11.22-21.1,
  12p11.1-12.1, -9q32-qter, -11q23.2-qter, -13q32-qter and -18q22-qter. Our findings
  suggest, that imbalances in cerebral germ cell tumors affect the same chromosomes
  as among their extracerebral counterparts, albeit in a considerably lower frequency
  among cerebral germinomas where 12p does not seem to play a major role.'
