abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization has increasingly become the standard
  of care to evaluate patients for genomic imbalance. As the patient population evaluated
  by microarray expands, there is certain to be an increase in the detection of unexpected,
  yet common diseases. When array results predict a late-onset disorder or cancer
  predisposition, it becomes a challenge for physicians and counselors to adequately
  address with patients. Included in this study were three patients described with
  nonspecific phenotypic findings who underwent microarray testing to better define
  their disease etiology. An unexpected deletion within the dystrophin gene was observed
  in each case, despite that no patient was suspected of a dystrophinopathy at the
  time of testing. The patients included an 8-day-old male with a dystrophin deletion
  predictive of Becker muscular dystrophy, an 18-month old female found to be the
  carrier of deletion, and a 4-year-8-month-old male with a deletion predictive of
  Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this circumstance it becomes difficult to counsel
  the family, as well as to predict disease course when underlying medical conditions
  may exist. However, early detection may enable the patient to receive proactive
  treatment, and allows for screening of at-risk family members. Ultimately, it is
  up to the clinician to promote informed decision-making within the family prior
  to testing, and ensure that adequate counseling is provided during follow-up.
