abstract: A case of glioblastoma multiforme GBM that was investigated with a broad
  spectrum of cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic techniques is reported. The results
  of cytogenetic studies, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, comparative
  genomic hybridization, and spectral karyotyping SKY are reported. Various structural
  chromosomal aberrations were identified, among which aberrations involving chromosome
  arm 2p were especially frequent. Using SKY, six translocations not previously described
  in GBM are reported.
