abstract: We performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH on 8 formalin-fixed,
  paraffin wax-embedded primary spermatocytic seminomas SS from 7 patients, one of
  whom developed metastatic disease. In general, this tumour type is not associated
  with development of metastases. Since there are only few reported cases of metastatic
  SS in the literature, this study is the first report of chromosomal constitution
  in a patient with metastatic disease. Chromosomal imbalances were observed in all
  8 tumours analysed by CGH. Frequent copy number alterations were enh 9 , dim 16
  or 16p , enh 20 and enh X , each in 6 samples, followed by dim 7 in 4, and enh 1
  , enh 18 and dim 15 , each in 3 samples. In addition to the CGH analysis, interphase
  fluorescence in situ hybridisation I-FISH was applied to evaluate the CGH results
  and to define the size of the aberrant cell population. Interphase cytogenetics
  showed gain of material on chromosomes 9 and X in all tumours analysed. Overall,
  the I-FISH results were in agreement with the CGH data. In conclusion, gain of chromosome
  9 seems to be restricted to SS and point to an important role for this aberration
  in the development of this tumour type.
