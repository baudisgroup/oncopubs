abstract: We identified the genomic signature of ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative
  disorders (LPDs), especially ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
  lymphoma, IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia
  (RLH), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  We included 52 subjects with
  ocular adnexal LPDs (13 orbital MALT lymphomas, 16 conjunctival MALT lymphomas,
  13 IgG4-RODs, 4 RLHs, and 6 DLBCLs) who had been treated at the Tokyo Medical University
  Hospital from 2008 to 2012. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tumor tissues and
  subjected to high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping
  using GeneChip Human Mapping 250K SNP arrays. The array data were investigated using
  Copy Number Analysis for GeneChips (CNAG) software.  In ocular adnexal MALT lymphomas,
  the most frequent copy number (CN) gain region was trisomy 3 detected in 31% (9/29),
  followed by trisomy 18 in 17% (5/29), and 6p and 21q in 14% (4/29). The most frequent
  CN loss regions were 6q and 9p, detected in 7% (2/29). Uniparental disomy was detected
  on 6q in 14% (4/29), followed by 3q in 10% (3/29). Copy number variations (CNVs)
  were not detected in IgG4-RODs and RLHs. Conversely, CNVs were more frequent in
  DLBCLs than in ocular adnexal MALT lymphomas. Copy number variations were detected
  in 77% (10/13) of orbital MALT lymphomas and in 67% (11/16) of conjunctival MALT
  lymphomas.  High-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array is a useful method
  for discriminating ocular adnexal lymphomas from benign LPDs. The differences in
  the chromosomal abnormality patterns may reflect the activity of ocular adnexal
  LPDs.
