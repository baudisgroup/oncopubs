abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas DIPGs are highly infiltrative malignant
  glial neoplasms of the ventral pons that, due to their location within the brain,
  are unsuitable for surgical resection and consequently have a universally dismal
  clinical outcome. The median survival time is 9-12 months, with neither chemotherapeutic
  nor targeted agents showing substantial survival benefit in clinical trials in children
  with these tumors. We report the identification of recurrent activating mutations
  in the ACVR1 gene, which encodes a type I activin receptor serine threonine kinase,
  in 21 of DIPG samples. Strikingly, these somatic mutations encoding p.Arg206His,
  p.Arg258Gly, p.Gly328Glu, p.Gly328Val, p.Gly328Trp and p.Gly356Asp substitutions
  have not been reported previously in cancer but are identical to mutations found
  in the germ line of individuals with the congenital childhood developmental disorder
  fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva FOP and have been shown to constitutively
  activate the BMP-TGF-beta signaling pathway. These mutations represent new targets
  for therapeutic intervention in this otherwise incurable disease.
