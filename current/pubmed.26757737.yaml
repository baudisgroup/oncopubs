abstract: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare malignancy confined
  to the central nervous system (CNS), and majority of PCNSL is pathologically classified
  as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We have now performed whole-exome sequencing
  for 41 tumor tissues of DLBCL-type PCNSL and paired normal specimens and also RNA-sequencing
  for 30 tumors, revealing a very high frequency of nonsynonymous somatic mutations
  in PIM1 (100Â %), BTG2 (92.7Â %), and MYD88 (85.4Â %). Many genes in the NF-ÎºB
  pathway are concurrently mutated within the same tumors. Further, focal deletion
  or somatic mutations in the HLA genes are associated with poor prognosis. Copy number
  amplification and overexpression of genes at chromosome 7q35 were both found to
  predict short progression-free survival as well. Oncogenic mutations in GRB2 were
  also detected, the effects of which in cultured cells were attenuated by inhibitors
  of the downstream kinases MAP2K1 and MAP2K2. Individuals with tumors positive for
  MYD88 mutations also harbored the same mutations at a low frequency in peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that MYD88 mutation-positive precancerous cells
  originate outside of the CNS and develop into lymphoma after additional genetic
  hits that confer adaptation to the CNS environment.
