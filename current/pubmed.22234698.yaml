abstract: To identify cooperating lesions in core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia,
  we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism-array analysis on 300 diagnostic and
  41 relapse adult and pediatric leukemia samples. We identified a mean of 1.28 copy
  number alterations per case at diagnosis in both patient populations. Recurrent
  minimally deleted regions MDRs were identified at 7q36.1 7.7 , 9q21.32 5 , 11p13
  2.3 , and 17q11.2 2 . Approximately one-half of the 7q deletions were detectable
  only by single-nucleotide polymorphism-array analysis because of their limited size.
  Sequence analysis of MLL3, contained within the 7q36.1 MDR, in 46 diagnostic samples
  revealed one truncating mutation in a leukemia lacking a 7q deletion. Recurrent
  focal gains were identified at 8q24.21 4.7 and 11q25 1.7 , both containing a single
  noncoding RNA. Recurrent regions of copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity were identified
  at 1p 1 , 4q 0.7 , and 19p 0.7 , with known mutated cancer genes present in the
  minimally altered region of 1p NRAS and 4q TET2 . Analysis of relapse samples identified
  recurrent MDRs at 3q13.31 12.2 , 5q 4.9 , and 17p 4.9 , with the 3q13.31 region
  containing only LSAMP, a putative tumor suppressor. Determining the role of these
  lesions in leukemogenesis and drug resistance should provide important insights
  into core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia.
