abstract: Liver metastases are found in 10 of primary colorectal malignancies, and
  they affects the prognosis of patients with colorectal carcinoma. The authors investigated
  DNA copy number aberrations by using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and DNA
  ploidy alterations by using flow cytometry FCM in patients with primary colorectal
  carcinoma primary tumors . To determine whether there are characteristic DNA copy
  number alterations that contribute to liver metastasis, cytogenetic aberrations
  were examined by CGH and FCM.
