abstract: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor syndrome that results from mutation
  of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The hallmark of NF2 is the presence of bilateral
  vestibular schwannoma (VS). Though NF2-associated and sporadic VS share identical
  histopathologic findings and cytogenetic alterations, NF2-associated VS often appears
  multilobulated, is less responsive to radiosurgery, and has worse surgical outcomes.
  Temporal bone autopsy specimens and MRI of the inner ear performed on NF2 patients
  suggest that multiple discrete tumors may be present within the labyrinth and cerebellopontine
  angle.  Treatment-naï¿½ve ears in patients enrolled in a prospective NF2 natural
  history study (NIH#08-N-0044) were included for MRI analysis. T2-weighted and postcontrast
  T1-weighted MRIs were evaluated for the presence of multiple discrete tumors or
  a multilobulated mass. Peripheral blood (germline) and regional samples of tumor
  tissue were procured from consecutive patients enrolled in this study undergoing
  resection of a multilobulated VS (MVS). Histopathologic evaluation and genetic analysis
  (single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, NF2 sequencing) were performed on
  each specimen.  Over half of NF2 ears harbored either an MVS (60/139 ears) or multiple
  discrete masses (19/139 ears). For 4 successive MVSs, genetic analysis revealed
  an admixture of cell populations, each with its own somatic NF2 mutation or deletion.  These
  findings suggest that the majority of NF2-associated VSs are polyclonal, such that
  the tumor mass represents a collision of multiple, distinct tumor clones. This explains
  the characteristic lobulated gross appearance of NF2-associated VS, and may also
  explain the substantially different treatment outcomes compared with sporadic VS.  Published
