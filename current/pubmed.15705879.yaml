abstract: BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations cause approximately 30 of breast cancers
  within high-risk families. This represents 5 of total breast cancer incidence. Although
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are both implicated in DNA repair and genome stability, it is unknown
  whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with similar or distinct diseases. In a previous
  study we reported that BRCA1-related breast carcinomas show a distinct genomic profile
  as determined by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We now hypothesize that,
  if functionally equivalent, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 would result in similar
  genomic profiles in tumors. Here we report the chromosomal gains and losses as measured
  by CGH in 25 BRCA2-associated breast tumors and compared them with our existing
  36 BRCA1 and 30 control profiles. We compared all chromosomal regions and determined
  the regions of differential gain or loss between tumor classes and controls. BRCA2
  and control tumors have very similar genomic profiles. As a consequence, and in
  contrast to BRCA1-associated tumors, CGH profiles from BRCA2-associated tumors could
  not be distinguished from control tumors using the classification methodology as
  we have developed before. The largest number of significant differences existed
  between BRCA1 and controls, followed by BRCA1 compared with BRCA2, suggesting different
  tumor development pathways for BRCA1 and BRCA2.
