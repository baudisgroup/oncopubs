abstract: Breast cancer includes high number of molecular entities targetable by specific
  agents. In this study, array CGH and PIK3CA AKT1 mutations were used to drive patients
  into targeted therapy. A prospective molecular analysis was offered to metastatic
  breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively or retrospectively
  either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue. Analyses were performed using array
  CGH Agilent platform and PIK3CA exon 10 and 21 and AKT1 mutations were explored
  by standard Sanger sequencing. One hundred and eight patients were included. Good
  quality CGH was obtained in 79 cases and was better for frozen samples. Genomic
  alterations were identified in 50 of patients including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations.
  Eighteen treatments 17 patients were administered according to their molecular profile
  with evidence of activity in nine. Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment
  included absence of progressive disease 38 , investigators choice 9 , rapid PD 19
  , and no drug access 21 . Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97 cases
  failures were related to low of tumour cells. Our study showed that array CGH is
  feasible in the context of daily practice and, in combination with PIK3CA AKT1 mutations,
  identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations that allow driving
  patients into specific targeted agents.
