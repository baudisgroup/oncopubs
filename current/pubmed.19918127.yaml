abstract: Atypical meningiomas exhibit heterogeneous clinical outcomes. It is unclear
  which atypical meningiomas require aggressive multimodality treatment with surgery
  and radiation therapy versus surgery alone to prevent recurrence. Detailed molecular-genetic
  characterization of these neoplasms is necessary to understand their pathogenesis
  and identify clinically relevant genetic markers. Oligonucleotide array comparative
  genomic hybridization was used to identify frequent genetic alterations in 47 primary
  atypical meningiomas resected at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 1987
  and September 2006. Eighty-five percent of samples exhibited loss of 22q, including
  the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene. The second most frequent regions of loss were
  confined to the short arm of chromosome 1, particularly 1p33-p36.2 70 and 1p13.2
  64 . Other frequent regions of loss, detected in more than 50 of samples, included
  14q, 10q, 8q, 7p, 21q, 19, 9q34, and 4p16. Frequent regions of gain were detected
  along 1q 59 , 17q 44 , 9q34 30 , and 7q36 26 . Univariate marker-by-marker analysis
  of all frequently identified copy number alterations showed potential correlation
  between gain of 1q and shorter progression-free survival. Given the heterogeneous
  treatment outcomes of atypical meningioma, investigation of large-scale and focal
  genomic alterations in multi-institutional efforts may help clarify molecular-genetic
  signatures of clinical use.
