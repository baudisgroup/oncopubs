abstract: 'Metastatic potential of breast cancer may be associated with specific genomic
  alterations and the earliest metastases are likely to be found in the sentinel lymph
  nodes SLN . Using array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH , we compared the
  genomes of primary breast invasive duct carcinomas IDCs , their sentinel and more
  distal lymph node metastases, and IDCs without nodal metastasis. Thirty-three samples
  from 22 patients with IDC were subjected to aCGH: 8 IDC samples from patients without
  lymph node metastasis, 11 IDCs associated with SLN metastases out of which 7 had
  paired samples of metastases, and 14 samples of lymph node metastases out of which
  8 were sentinel-distal pairs from 4 patients. aCGH data were analyzed by correlation
  of genomic profiles, cluster analysis, segmentation, and peak identification. Quantitative
  real-time PCR was used for data validation. We observed high genomic similarity
  between primary tumors and their nodal metastases as well as between metastases
  to the sentinel and distal lymph nodes. Several recurrent alterations were detected
  preferentially in IDC associated with SLN metastases compared to IDCs without metastasis.
  Amplification within the 17q24.1-24.2 59.96-62.76 Mb region was associated with
  presence of sentinel or distal lymph node metastases larger tumor size and higher
  histological grade. In our samples, there were genomic events associated with metastatic
  progression, which could be detected in both primary tumors and LN metastases. Gain
  on 17q24.1-24.2 is a candidate region for further testing as a predictor of nodal
  metastasis.'
