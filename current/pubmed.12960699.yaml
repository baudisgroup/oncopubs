abstract: Dedifferentiated and differentiated liposarcoma are characterized by 12q15
  chromosomal amplification. Comparative genomic hybridization is a powerful tool
  able to detect DNA copy number changes in the genome. This technique has been widely
  used in frozen tumors and in some studies in paraffin-embedded tumors fixed with
  formalin. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the ability of CGH to detect
  DNA copy number changes in the genome when the DNA was extracted from tissues fixed
  with Holland Bouins fluid. Sixteen liposarcoma tumors both frozen and fixed in Holland
  Bouins fluid were characterized by CGH. Eighty-one percent of the main chromosomal
  alterations detected in the frozen liposarcomas amp 12q15, amp 6q23, amp 1p32, amp
  16q22, 7, 8 were detected in the corresponding fixed tumors. The limitation of this
  technique when using Holland Bouins fluid extracted DNA compared with formalin-extracted
  DNA was the yield of analyzable samples. Eighty-one percent of tumors fixed with
  Holland Bouins fluid 13 16 were analyzable compared with 100 of formalin-fixed tumors
  4 4 . This study demonstrates that comparative genomic hybridization is a useful
  tool even if only fixed tissues formalin and Holland Bouins fluid tissues are available,
  and that it allows more tumors to be analyzed in retrospective studies.
