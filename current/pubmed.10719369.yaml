abstract: DNA copy number losses at chromosome arm 14q are the most frequently occurring
  aberrations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs . To characterize the deletion
  at 14q, we performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH and high-resolution deletion
  mapping using a panel of 32 polymorphic microsatellite markers in 30 GISTs. The
  GISTs were classified according to their metastatic potential and mitotic counts
  into 15 low-risk and 15 high-risk tumors. Losses with a minimal common overlapping
  region at 14q12-q24 were detected by CGH in 16 tumors 53 nine low-risk and seven
  high-risk . Investigation with microsatellite markers was informative in 690 analyses
  72 . Loss of heterozygosity LOH with at least one marker was detected in 279 analyses
  in 24 tumors 80 . Deletions were equally frequent in low-risk and high-risk GISTs.
  Two common deletion regions were identified at 14q11.1-q12 and 14q23-q24.3. The
  highest frequencies of deletions were seen in regions corresponding to markers D14S283
  20 28, 71 at 14q11.1-q12 and D14S258 17 27, 63 at 14q23-q24, suggesting that these
  are two tumor suppressor loci.
