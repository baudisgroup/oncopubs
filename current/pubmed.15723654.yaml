abstract: We performed genome-wide screening for deoxyribonucleic acid copy-number
  aberrations in 31 gastric cancer GC cell lines by using custom-made comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH -array. Copy-number gains were frequently detected at
  1q, 3q, 5p, 7p, 7q, 8q, 11q, 17q, 20p, 20q, Xp and Xq, and losses at 3p, 4p, 4q,
  8p, 9p, 18p and 18q. With respect to histological subtypes, copy-number gains at
  1p, 16p, 20p, 20q and 22q, and losses at 8p, 10p, 10q and 18q were significantly
  frequent in cell lines derived from tumors of the well-differentiated type, whereas
  copy-number gains at 1q, 7p, 7q, Xp and Xq were frequent in the undifferentiated
  type. Homozygous deletions were seen at five loci, whereas high-level amplifications
  were detected in 15 of the 31 GC cell lines these had occurred at 24 loci, including
  the segment containing CDK6 7q21.2 . Amplification of that gene had never been reported
  in GC before. Immunohistochemical studies showed increased levels of CDK6 protein
  in 54 of the 292 primary GC samples we examined 18.5 . Cytoplasmic localization
  of CDK6, as well as CDK6 over-expression, was more frequent in well-differentiated
  GC than in undifferentiated tumors. Nuclear expression of CDK6 was more frequent
  in early stage GC than in advanced tumors, suggesting that nuclear localization
  of CDK6 is likely to be a prognostic factor for GC. Taken together, our data indicate
  that CDK6 might be involved in the pathogenesis of GC and, more generally, that
  CGH-arrays have a powerful potential for identifying novel cancer-related genetic
  changes in a variety of tumors.
