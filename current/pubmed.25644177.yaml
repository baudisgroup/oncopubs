abstract: Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and T cell/histiocyte
  rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) usually affect middle-aged men, show tumour
  cells with a B cell phenotype and a low tumour cell content. Whereas the clinical
  behaviour of NLPHL is indolent, THRLBCL presents with advanced stage disease and
  an aggressive behaviour. In the present study, array comparative genomic hybridization
  was performed in seven typical NLPHL, four THRLBCL-like NLPHL variants, six THRLBCL
  and four diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) derived from NLPHL. The number of
  genomic aberrations was higher in THRLBCL compared with typical and THRLBCL-like
  variant of NLPHL. Gains of 2p16.1 and losses of 2p11.2 and 9p11.2 were commonly
  observed in typical and THRLBCL-like variants of NLPHL as well as THRLBCL. Gains
  of 2p16.1, affecting the REL locus were confirmed in an independent cohort. Expression
  of the REL protein was observed at similar frequencies in typical and THRLBCL-like
  variant of NLPHL as well as THRLBCL (33-38%). In conclusion, the present study reveals
  further similarities between NLPHL and THRLBCL on the genomic level, confirming
  thatï¿½these entities are part of a pathobiological spectrum with common molecular
  features, but varying clinical presentations.  ï¿½ 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
