abstract: Most patients with BRAF V600 -mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance
  to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance
  mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood.
  We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors
  from 45 patients with BRAF V600 -mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib
  or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor
  resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients 51 . Besides previously characterized
  alterations, we discovered a quot long tail quot of new mitogen-activated protein
  kinase MAPK pathway alterations MAP2K2, MITF that confer RAF inhibitor resistance.
  In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same
  tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance
  mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations
  may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAF V600 -mutant melanoma.
  Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance
  studies.
