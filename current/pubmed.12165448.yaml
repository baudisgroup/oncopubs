abstract: Cell proliferation and chromosomal imbalances, important parameters in relation
  to tumor progression, were studied in ameloblastoma n 20 , a benign odontogenic
  tumor of locally recurrent nature. Immunocytochemical staining with MIB-1 antibody
  and comparative genomic hybridization CGH were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  ameloblastomas. The mean follow-up time was 12.4 years. An MIB-1-index was formed
  by counting 5000 tumor-cell nuclei in 10-15 randomly chosen high-power fields and
  calculating percentages of positively stained cells. CGH involved hybridization
  of FITC-dUTP-labeled tumor DNA with Texas-red-labeled normal DNA. Images were digitally
  analyzed. The MIB-1-index range 0-2.51 was low for all tumors. No statistically
  significant correlation between MIB-1 index and tendency to recurrence was found.
  Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 2 of 17 cases. The results suggest that
  formation of an MIB-1 index is not helpful in assessing future clinical behavior
  of an ameloblastoma and that chromosomal imbalances are uncommon.
