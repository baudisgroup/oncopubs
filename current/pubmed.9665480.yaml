abstract: The evolution of somatic genetic aberrations in breast cancer has remained
  poorly understood. The most common chromosomal abnormality is hyperdiploidy, which
  is thought to arise via a transient hypodiploid state. However, hypodiploidy persists
  in 1 to 2 of breast tumors, which are characterized by a poor prognosis. We studied
  the genetic aberrations in 15 flow cytometrically hypodiploid breast cancers by
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  . Surprisingly, numerous copy number gains were detected in addition to the copy
  number losses. The number of gains per tumor was 4.3 - 3.2 and that of losses was
  4.5 - 3.3 mean - SD , which is similar to that previously observed in hyperdiploid
  breast cancers. Gains at chromosomes or chromosomal regions at 11q13, 1q, 19, and
  16p and losses of 2q, 4, 6q, 9p, 13, and 18 were most commonly observed. Compared
  with unselected breast carcinomas, hypodiploid tumors showed certain differences.
  Loss of chromosome 4 53 and gain of 11q13 60 were significantly more common in hypodiploid
  tumors. The gain at 11q13 was found by FISH to harbor amplification of the Cyclin
  D1 oncogene, which is therefore three to four times more common in hypodiploid than
  in unselected breast cancers 15 to 20 . Structural chromosomal aberrations such
  as Cyclin D1 amplification were present both in diploid and hypodiploid tumor cell
  populations, as assessed by FISH and CGH after flow cytometric sorting. Together
  these results indicate that hypodiploid tumors form a distinct genetic entity of
  invasive breast cancer, although they probably share a common genetic evolution
  pathway where structural chromosomal aberrations precede gross DNA ploidy changes.
