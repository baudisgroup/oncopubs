abstract: Chondrosarcomas of the bone are malignant hyaline cartilage-forming tumors
  with an annual incidence rate of 3.6 of all primary bone malignancies in the United
  States. Specimens of 25 chondrosarcomas 10 grade I, 9 grade II, 1 grade III, and
  5 dedifferentiated from 23 patients were collected from the Department of Pathology
  at the University Hospital at UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School from 1996 to 2007.
  Array-based comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH studies were performed on
  frozen tumor specimens. Recurrent deletions observed in at least in six tumors were
  5q13.2, 5q14.2 approximately q21.3, 6q12 approximately q13, 6q16 approximately q25.3,
  9p24.2 approximately q12, and 9p21.3. There was a statistically significant association
  between high-grade tumor grade III and dedifferentiated and the recurrent genetic
  deletions at 5q14.2 approximately q21.3, 6q16 approximately q25.3, 9p24.2 approximately
  q12, and 9p21.3. There is consistency between increased levels of aneuploidy and
  the progression of chondrosarcoma from lower to higher grades.
