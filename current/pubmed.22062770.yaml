abstract: DNA ploidy analysis is useful for prognostication in cancer patients, but
  the genomic details underlying ploidy changes are not fully understood. To improve
  this understanding, we compared DNA ploidy status with karyotypic and comparative
  genomic hybridization data on 51 endometrial adenocarcinomas. Out of 34 DNA diploid
  tumors evaluated by CGH, 16 47 showed imbalances, though only two had more than
  four copy number changes. Ten 29 had aberrations involving chromosome 1, seven 21
  involving chromosome 10, while one tumor had a chromosome 8 aberration. Four of
  the seven DNA tetraploid tumors 57 had imbalances detected by CGH with two 29 having
  more than four. Six out of eight DNA aneuploid tumors showed imbalances by CGH,
  with five 63 having more than four. The aberrations were observed on chromosomes
  1 and 8 in five eight 63 cases while four imbalances 50 involved chromosomes 5,
  7 and X. Not surprisingly, we observed a significant correlation between increasing
  DNA ploidy complexity and increasing number of copy alterations. Gains of material
  from chromosomes 8 and 7 might be specifically correlated to DNA aneuploidy in endometrial
  adenocarcinomas since 63 and 50 of the aneuploid compared to 3 of the diploid tumors
  showed imbalances involving these chromosomes.
