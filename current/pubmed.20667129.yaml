abstract: HER2 gene copy status, and concomitant administration of trastuzumab Herceptin
  , remains one of the best examples of targeted cancer therapy based on understanding
  the genomic etiology of disease. However, newly diagnosed breast cancer cases with
  equivocal HER2 results present a challenge for the oncologist who must make treatment
  decisions despite the patients unresolved HER2 status. In some cases both immunohistochemistry
  IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH are reported as equivocal, whereas
  in other cases IHC results and FISH are discordant for positive versus negative
  results. The recent validation of array-based, molecular karyotyping for clinical
  oncology testing provides an alternative method for determination of HER2 gene copy
  number status in cases remaining unresolved by traditional methods.
