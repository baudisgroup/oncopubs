abstract: 'This investigation aimed to identify patterns of copy number change in
  colorectal tumor progression from adenoma to liver metastasis. Fifty-three microdissected
  sub-regions from 17 cases of colorectal cancer were assigned to one of six histopathologically
  defined categories: coexisting adenoma, tumor above the muscularis layer, tumor
  within the muscularis layer, tumor extending through the bowel wall to serosal fat,
  lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis. Microdissected samples were treated
  by a microwave processing step and then used as templates for universal PCR amplification.
  PCR products were fluorophore labeled and subjected to comparative genomic hybridization.
  Copy number changes were found in all samples, and every chromosome arm excluding
  acrocentric short arms was affected. More losses than gains were detected, but there
  were no significant differences between the numbers of changes seen in each category.
  Each individual sample revealed unique changes, additional to those shared within
  each case. The most frequently observed gains were of X and 12q. The most common
  losses were of 8p, 16p, 9p, 15q, 18q, and 10q. Nominally significant associations
  were observed between metastatic tumor and loss of 12q24.1 or 10p13-14, non-metastatic
  tumor and loss of 8q24.1, tumor extending to serosal fat and loss of 6q24-25 or
  gain of 4q11-13, tumor extending to serosal fat and metastatic lesions and loss
  of 4q32-34 or 22q11-12, and adenoma and loss of 15q24. Loss of 4q32-34 remained
  highly significant after correction for multiple testing. Adenoma was the only category
  not to show loss of 17p. These data reveal a genetically heterogeneous picture of
  tumor progression, with a small number of changes associated with advanced disease.'
