abstract: 'B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL is not a uniform disease entity
  approximately half of the CLL cases have undergone immunoglobulin V H gene hypermutation,
  whereas the other half display unmutated V H genes. We investigated genome changes
  in 12 hypermutated cases M-CLL and 22 unmutated cases UM-CLL by use of comparative
  genomic hybridization, G-banding, and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization
  m-FISH after optimal mitogen stimulation and FISH analysis of typical CLL aberrations:
  11q deletion, 13q deletion, and trisomy 12. Very high frequencies of aberrations
  were found in both groups: 82 in UM-CLL and 83 in M-CLL. Deletions of 11q and 13q
  were equally distributed in M-CLL and UM-CLL. However, larger aberrations detectable
  by CGH, trisomy 12, and complex aberrations were less frequent in M-CLL than in
  UM-CLL. These observations led to a hypothesis that unmutated and mutated CLL have
  different biological Backgrounds, given that large and or complex chromosomal aberrations
  and hypermutation of the CLL progenitor cells tend to be mutually exclusive.'
