abstract: Current models of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression do not fully
  reflect the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of the disease. The aim of the
  present study was to identify genetic changes discriminating adenomas that have
  progressed to carcinoma from adenomas that have not progressed, and to refine the
  current genetic models of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression, based on
  a genome-wide analysis of chromosomal aberrations.
