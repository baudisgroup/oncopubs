abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a molecular cytogenetic technique
  that allows the entire genome of a tumor to be surveyed for gains and losses of
  DNA copy sequences. A limited number of studies reporting the use of this technique
  in adult adrenocortical tumors have yielded conflicting results. In this study we
  performed CGH analysis on 13 malignant, 18 benign, and 1 tumor of indeterminate
  malignant potential with the aim of identifying genetic loci consistently implicated
  in the development and progression of adrenocortical tumors. Tissue samples from
  32 patients with histologically proven adrenocortical tumors were available for
  CGH analysis. CGH changes were seen in all cancers, 11 of 18 61 adenomas, and the
  1 tumor of indeterminate malignant potential. Of the adrenal cancers, the most common
  gains were seen on chromosomes 5 46 , 12 38 , 19 31 , and 4 31 . Losses were most
  frequently seen at 1p 62 , 17p 54 , 22 38 , 2q 31 , and 11q 31 . Of the benign adenomas,
  the most common change was gain of 4q 22 . Mann-Whitney analysis showed a highly
  significant difference between the cancer group mean changes, 7.6 and the adenoma
  group mean changes, 1.1 for the number of observed CGH changes P amp lt 0.01 . Logistic
  regression analysis showed that the number of CGH changes was highly predictive
  of tumor type P amp lt 0.01 . This study has identified several chromosomal loci
  implicated in adrenocortical tumorigenesis. Activation of a protooncogene s on chromosome
  4 may be an early event, with progression from adenoma to carcinoma involving activation
  of oncogenes on chromosomes 5 and 12 and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
  on chromosome arms 1p and 17p.
