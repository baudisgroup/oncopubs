abstract: Lung cancer is the worldwide leading cause of death from cancer and has
  been shown to be a heterogeneous disease at the genomic level. To delineate the
  genomic landscape of copy number alterations, amplifications, loss-of-heterozygosity
  (LOH), tumor ploidy and copy-neutral allelic imbalance in lung cancer, microarray-based
  genomic profiles from 2,141 tumors and cell lines including adenocarcinomas (AC,
  n = 1,206), squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC, n = 467), large cell carcinomas (n =
  37) and small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC, n = 88) were assembled from different
  repositories. Copy number alteration differences between lung cancer histologies
  were confirmed in 285 unrelated tumors analyzed by BAC array comparative genomic
  hybridization. Tumor ploidy patterns were validated by DNA flow cytometry analysis
  of 129 unrelated cases. Eighty-nine recurrent copy number alterations (55 gains,
  34 losses) were identified harboring genes with gene expression putatively driven
  by gene dosage through integration with gene expression data for 496 cases. Thirteen
  and 26 of identified regions discriminated AC/SqCC and AC/SqCC/SCLC, respectively,
  while 48 regions harbored recurrent (n > 15) high-level amplifications comprising
  established and putative oncogenes, differing in frequency and coamplification patterns
  between histologies. Lung cancer histologies displayed differences in patterns/frequency
  of copy number alterations, genomic architecture, LOH, copy-neutral allelic imbalance
  and tumor ploidy, with AC generally displaying less copy number alterations and
  allelic imbalance. Moreover, a strong association was demonstrated between different
  types of copy number alterations and allelic imbalances with tumor aneuploidy. In
  summary, these analyses provide a comprehensive overview of the landscape of genomic
  alterations in lung cancer, highlighting differences but also similarities between
  subgroups of the disease.
