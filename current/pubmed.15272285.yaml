abstract: Thymic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors are a rare neoplasm of the anterior
  mediastinum. The tumors frequently exhibit a wide spectrum of histology and appear
  to follow a more aggressive behavior than their nonthymic counterparts. Given the
  differing clinicopathologic manifestations, thymic neuroendocrine tumors may also
  possess different cytogenetic abnormalities from those that occur in foregut carcinoid
  tumors. In this study, we employed comparative genomic hybridization to detect genomic
  instability in 10 sporadic thymic neuroendocrine tumors and one multiple endocrine
  neoplasia type 1 MEN1 -associated case. Gross chromosomal imbalances were found
  in nine cases, including gains of chromosomal material on regions X, 8, 18 and 20p
  and losses on 3, 6, 9q, 13q and 11q. We did not observe deletion at locus 11q13
  where the MEN1 gene is located. These findings were essentially dissimilar to those
  reported in sporadic and MEN1-associated foregut carcinoid tumors. Consequently,
  we consider that a distinctive cytogenetic mechanism is at work in the development
  of thymic neuroendocrine tumors, which is different from that of foregut carcinoid
  tumors.
