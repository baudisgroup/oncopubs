abstract: We present a case of acute myeloblastic leukemia AML-M2 with a complex t
  8 21 translocation and additional acquired chromosomes yielding a hyperdiploid karyotype.
  AML1 ETO transcript was observed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
  Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , spectral karyotyping SKY , and comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH were performed to further identify the chromosomes observed
  by G banding. The patient was treated according to our current protocol for AML.
  He remains in complete remission 11 months from diagnosis. Further follow-up of
  this patient and the analysis of a larger number of children are needed to define
  whether the gains of the specific extra chromosomes modify the good prognosis that
  t 8 21 confers to this subgroup of AML.
