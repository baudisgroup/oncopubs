abstract: Solitary fibrous tumours SFTs of the pleura, in contrast to malignant mesothelioma,
  occur independently of previous asbestos exposure. They are benign tumours, but
  may recur if the stalk to the adjacent pleural or lung tissue remains in situ during
  surgical removal. The molecular pathology of SFTs is largely unknown. We used comparative
  genomic hybridisation CGH to characterise 12 localised SFTs and 12 predominantly
  sarcomatoid mesotheliomas. Fifty-eight percent of the investigated SFTs did not
  show any chromosomal imbalances. The most frequent defects were losses on chromosome
  arms 13q 33 , 4q and 21q 17 each . Significant gains were seen at chromosome 8 and
  at 15q in two cases each. There was no correlation between tumour size and molecular
  pathology findings. In contrast, 75 of the mesotheliomas carried chromosomal defects.
  On average, the mesotheliomas showed over three times as many defects per tumour
  as the SFTs. Localisation of several frequent losses and gains were similar to those
  of the SFTs. Therefore, in individual cases, a clear distinction between SFTs and
  sarcomatoid mesotheliomas is not possible based on CGH analysis alone. Further molecular
  characterisation of this rare tumour entity will be necessary to elucidate possible
  genes involved in early tumorigenesis.
