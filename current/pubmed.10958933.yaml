abstract: Uterine leiomyomata are among the most common of human neoplasms and are
  associated with abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, and abdominal pain. Uterine
  leiomyosarcomata are presumed to be the malignant counterpart to uterine leiomyomata
  and are very rare. Transformation of uterine leiomyoma ULM into uterine leiomyosarcoma
  ULMS is yet to be conclusively confirmed, and each type of tumor may represent a
  distinct genetic entity. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to evaluate
  DNA sequence copy-number changes in 12 specimens of ULM and 8 of ULMS. CGH analysis
  of ULM demonstrated chromosomal imbalances in 8 of 12 66. 7 specimens. The most
  frequent ULM gains were observed at 9q34 a novel finding and on chromosome 19. Other
  ULM imbalances included gains and losses of chromosome 1p, losses on 7q, and gains
  on 12q. All ULMS specimens demonstrated chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome 1 imbalances
  were very prominent. The most frequent losses were detected on 14q and 22q. Losses
  on 14q are rarely seen in other types of leiomyo-sarcoma and may be a distinctive
  feature of ULMS. Gains on chromosomes 8, 17, and X were observed in half the cases
  and were accompanied by high-level amplification. Other chromosome arms overrepresented
  included 12q and 19p. The absence of specific anomalies common to all ULM and ULMS
  argues against their being benign-malignant counterparts.
