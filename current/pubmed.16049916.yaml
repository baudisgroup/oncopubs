abstract: Natural killer NK cell lymphomas leukemias are highly aggressive lymphoid
  malignancies, but little is known about their genomic alterations, and thus there
  is an urgent need for identification and analysis of NK cell lymphomas leukemias.
  Recently, we developed our own array-based comparative genomic hybridization array
  CGH with an average resolution of 1.3 Mb. We performed an array CGH analysis for
  27 NK-cell lymphoma leukemia cases that were classified into two disease groups
  based on the World Health Organization Classification 10 aggressive NK-cell leukemia
  cases and 17 extranodal NK T-cell NK T lymphomas, nasal type . We identified the
  differences in the genomic alteration patterns of the two groups. The recurrent
  regions characteristic of the aggressive NK-cell leukemia group compared with those
  of the extranodal NK T lymphoma, nasal-type group, were gain of 1q and loss of 7p15.1-p22.3
  and 17p13.1. In particular, gain of 1q23.1-24.2 P 0.041 and 1q31.3-q44 P 0.003-0.047
  , and loss of 7p15.1-p22.3 P 0.012-0.041 and 17p13.1 P 0.012 occurred significantly
  more frequently in the former than in the latter group. Recurrent regions characteristic
  of the extranodal NK T lymphoma, nasal-type group, compared with those of the other
  group were gain of 2q, and loss of 6q16.1-q27, 11q22.3-q23.3, 5p14.1-p14.3, 5q34-q35.3,
  1p36.23-p36.33, 2p16.1-p16.3, 4q12, and 4q31.3-q32.1. Our results can be expected
  to provide further insights into the genetic basis of lymphomagenesis and the clinicopathologic
  features of NK-cell lymphomas leukemias.
