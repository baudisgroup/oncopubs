abstract: Primary mediastinal germ cell tumors M-GCTs represent a heterogeneous group
  of tumors that varies with regard to age at presentation, histologic differentiation,
  and outcome. We retrospectively analyzed archival tissue samples of mediastinal
  mature and immature teratomas n 15 and malignant nonseminomatous M-GCTs n 20 with
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The aim of this study was to define distinct
  genetic subgroups of M-GCT among the pediatric cohort that may differ in their clinical
  behavior and prognosis. All pure teratomas showed normal CGH profiles. Malignant
  M-GCTs in infants and children amp lt 8 years old most frequently showed a gain
  of 1q, 3, and 20q and a loss of 1p, 4q, and 6q. Gain of 12p and sex chromosomal
  abnormalities were not observed in this age group. In contrast, the gain of 12p
  was the most common aberration in M-GCTs that arose in children amp gt or 8 years
  old. Additional recurrent changes included the loss of chromosome 13 and the gain
  of chromosome 21. All ten adolescents with malignant M-GCT were male, and five showed
  a gain of the X chromosome. In two of these five patients, Klinefelter syndrome
  was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis or by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  . In conclusion, CGH analysis of M-GCTs defines distinct genetic subgroups. Mediastinal
  teratomas show no genetic gains or losses. Malignant M-GCTs in children amp lt 8
  years old show the same pattern of gains and losses identified in sacrococcygeal
  and testicular GCTs at this age, and they lack sex-chromosomal abnormalities. Malignant
  M-GCTs in children amp gt or 8 years old show the same genetic profile previously
  reported in gonadal GCTs at this age. In addition, approximately 50 demonstrate
  a gain of the X chromosome, consistent with Klinefelter syndrome. Cooperative group
  studies reveal a significantly better prognosis of malignant M-GCT arising in infants
  compared to that in adolescents, suggesting that these genetic differences are associated
  with differences in clinical behavior.
