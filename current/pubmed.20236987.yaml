abstract: Most current microarray oligonucleotide probe design strategies are based
  on probe design factors PDFs , which include probe hybridization free energy PHFE
  , probe minimum folding energy PMFE , dimer score, hairpin score, homology score
  and complexity score. The impact of these PDFs on probe performance was evaluated
  using four sets of microarray comparative genome hybridization aCGH data, which
  included two array manufacturing methods and the genomes of two species. Since most
  of the hybridizing DNA is equimolar in CGH data, such data are ideal for testing
  the general hybridization properties of almost all candidate oligonucleotides. In
  all our data sets, PDFs related to probe secondary structure PMFE, hairpin score
  and dimer score are the most significant factors linearly correlated with probe
  hybridization intensities. PHFE, homology and complexity score are correlating significantly
  with probe specificities, but in a non-linear fashion. We developed a new PDF, pseudo
  probe binding energy PPBE , by iteratively fitting dinucleotide positional weights
  and dinucleotide stacking energies until the average residue sum of squares for
  the model was minimized. PPBE showed a better correlation with probe sensitivity
  and a better specificity than all other PDFs, although training data are required
  to construct a PPBE model prior to designing new oligonucleotide probes. The physical
  properties that are measured by PPBE are as yet unknown but include a platform-dependent
  component. A practical way to use these PDFs for probe design is to set cutoff thresholds
  to filter out bad quality probes. Programs and correlation parameters from this
  study are freely available to facilitate the design of DNA microarray oligonucleotide
  probes.
