abstract: Despite the use of PSA, Gleason score, and T-category as prognosticators
  in intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 20-40 of patients will fail local therapy.
  In order to optimize treatment approaches for intermediate-risk patients, additional
  genetic prognosticators are needed. Previous reports using array comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH in radical prostatectomy cohorts suggested a combination of allelic
  loss of the PTEN gene on 10q and allelic gain of the c-MYC gene on 8q were associated
  with metastatic disease. We tested whether copy number alterations CNAs in PTEN
  allelic loss and c-MYC allelic gain were associated with biochemical relapse following
  modern-era, image-guided radiotherapy mean dose 76.4 Gy . We used aCGH analyses
  validated by fluorescence in-situ hybridization FISH of DNA was derived from frozen,
  pre-treatment biopsies in 126 intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Patients
  whose tumors had CNAs in both PTEN and c-MYC had significantly increased genetic
  instability percent genome alteration PGA compared to tumors with normal PTEN and
  c-MYC status p amp lt 0.0001 . We demonstrate that c-MYC gain alone, or combined
  c-MYC gain and PTEN loss, were increasingly prognostic for relapse on multivariable
  analyses hazard ratios HR of 2.58 p 0.005 and 3.21 p 0.0004 respectively . Triaging
  patients by the use of CNAs within pre-treatment biopsies may allow for better use
  of systemic therapies to target sub-clinical metastases or locally recurrent disease
  and improve clinical outcomes.
