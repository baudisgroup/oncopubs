abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most frequently occurring malignant
  tumors worldwide. The incidence of HCC is much higher in males than in females.
  In order to clarify the molecular basis of the male predominance in HCC, we have
  characterized the detailed genomic alterations in 5 hepatitis B virus integrated
  Korean HCC cell lines using G-banding, comparative genomic hybridization CGH , fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH , PCR, and CGH array. The commonest alterations were
  observed in chromosome 7 and Y, as well as chromosomal regions 1q, 8q, 4q, and 16q.
  The most frequent aberration of genomic material was gain of 1q and loss of chromosome
  Y. Significant loss of DNA copy number of the cancer related genes that are located
  on chromosome Y was detected by CGH array. By investigating the karyotypes of the
  previously reported 21 male HCC cell lines, we found 18 HCC cell lines with Y chromosome
  loss, indicating that this loss is a significant feature of HCC cell lines. We propose
  that Y chromosome loss in HCC cell lines may be responsible for the preponderance
  of males in HCC and its significance may lead to further studies for better understanding
  of carcinogenesis in HCC.
