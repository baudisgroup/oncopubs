abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children.
  However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between
  adult and paediatric cases. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction,
  we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX
  chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent
  mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant
  H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two
  critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory
  post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (Î±-thalassaemia/mental retardation
  syndrome X-linked) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits
  of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric
  heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in
  100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations
  were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX
  mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies
  (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children
  and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was
  strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene
  expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent
  mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of
  the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.
