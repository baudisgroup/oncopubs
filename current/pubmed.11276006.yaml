abstract: 'Liver cell adenomas LCAs are rare tumours which may be difficult to differentiate
  from low-grade hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs . This study used comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to look for cytogenetic aberrations which would serve to distinguish
  between these tumours. For this purpose, ten LCAs and six well-differentiated HCCs
  were analysed and the results were compared with those reported previously for 15
  well-differentiated HCCs. Aberrations were seen in 2 10 LCAs: a gain of chromosome
  7p was observed in one and gains of 17q and 20 in a second case. In 6 6 well-differentiated
  HCCs, up to 13 aberrations were detectable, with a mean of 7.2 aberrations per case
  in chromosome sites 1q, 4p, 4q, 5p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 7p, 7q, 8p, 8q, 10q, 11p, 13q, 14q,
  16p, 16q, 17p, 17q, 20p, 20q, and 21q. Aberrations focused on gains or losses of
  six chromosome sites, 1q, 4q, 8p, 8q, 16p, and 17p in all HCC samples, at least
  two of these sites were affected. None of these aberrations occurred in any of the
  LCAs analysed. CGH is therefore helpful in distinguishing between LCA and well-differentiated
  HCC. Detection of one or more of the six most frequent aberrations in HCC supports
  the diagnosis of carcinoma and makes LCA unlikely.'
