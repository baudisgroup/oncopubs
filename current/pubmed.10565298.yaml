abstract: The t X 18 p11.2 q11.2 SYT SSX1 or SSX2 is represented in more than 95 of
  synovial sarcoma. Even if recent data has implicated that the type of fusion gene
  SYT SSX1 or SYT SSX2 can be of prognostic importance, the cellular and molecular
  mechanisms underlying the clinical behavior of synovial sarcoma are still poorly
  understood. To approach this issue, we investigated whether secondary genetic aberrations
  may influence the clinical outcome of synovial sarcoma. Clinical outcome with reference
  to comparative genomic hybridization CGH findings losses or gains of genetic material
  were analyzed for a uniquely large modern material of 69 synovial sarcomas. Thirty-five
  of 69 specimens showed DNA sequence copy number changes. The frequency of aberrations
  tumor were higher mean 4.7 for monophasic tumors than for biphasic tumors mean 2.1
  . Gains of the whole or parts, including the long arm, of chromosome 8 were significantly
  overrepresented in large tumors amp gt 5 cm , suggesting that tumors with this genetic
  abnormality have an increased growth rate. No difference regarding metastasis-free
  or overall survival was seen between patients with or without tumors containing
  secondary copy number changes. No specific copy number change was linked to a significantly
  improved or impaired metastasis-free survival.
