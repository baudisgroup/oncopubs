abstract: To identify oncogene amplification involved in ovarian carcinogenesis, we
  studied 21 ovarian carcinomas and 5 serous borderline tumors using conventional
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH and CGH to a genomic DNA microarray. Immunohistochemical
  analysis of the proteins encoded by the genes that were amplified frequently FGF3
  4, FGFR1, CCNE1, PAK1, JUNB, and MDM2 was performed on a tissue microarray comprising
  254 cases of ovarian neoplasms. Regarding histologic type, characteristic patterns
  of copy number changes were revealed. They correlated with histologic tumor type
  and with intratumoral heterogeneity. Gain of FGF3 4 and CCNE1 was found in all serous
  carcinomas. Endometrioid carcinomas most frequently showed gain of JUNB 83 , KRAS2
  67 , MYCN 50 , ESR 50 , and CCND2 50 . Of the serous borderline tumors, 80 harbored
  amplification of FGFR1 and MDM2 and a 75 gain of PIK3CA. Only CCNE1 immunoreactivity
  was significantly correlated with CGH results P amp lt .05 and postoperative survival
  P amp lt .05 . Microarray-based genomic analysis in combination with immunohistochemical
  analysis was found to be a powerful technique for identification of clinically relevant
  gene amplification in human ovarian cancer.
