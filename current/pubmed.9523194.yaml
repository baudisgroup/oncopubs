abstract: We analyzed 72 primary and 25 recurrent glioblastoma multiforme GBM samples
  for DNA sequence copy number abnormalities CNAs by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . The number of aberrations per tumor ranged from 2 to 23 in primary GBM and
  5 to 25 in recurrent GBM. There were 26 chromosome regions with CNAs in more than
  20 of tumors. 7q22-36 was the most common gain and 10q25-26 was the most common
  loss each occurred in more than 70 of tumors. Of 27 amplification sites, epidermal
  growth factor receptor EGFR was the most common it was observed in 25 of primary
  GBMs. Statistical analysis based on pairwise correlation of CNAs indicated that
  there is more than one class of primary GBM.
