abstract: The 8p11-12 chromosome region is one of the regions most frequently amplified
  in breast carcinoma 10-15 of cases . Several genes within this region have been
  identified as candidate oncogenes, as they are both amplified and overexpressed.
  However, very few studies have explored the role of these genes in cell transformation,
  with the aim of identifying valuable therapeutic targets. An analysis of comparative
  genomic hybridization array and expression profiling data for a series of 152 ductal
  breast carcinomas and 21 cell lines identified five genes LSM1, BAG4, DDHD2, PPAPDC1B,
  and WHSC1L1 within the amplified region as consistently overexpressed due to an
  increased gene copy number. The use of small interfering RNA to knock down the expression
  of each of these genes showed the major role played by two genes, PPAPDC1B and WHSC1L1,
  in regulating the survival and transformation of two different cell lines harboring
  the 8p amplicon. The role of these two genes in cell survival and cell transformation
  was also confirmed by long-term knockdown expression studies using short hairpin
  RNAs. The potential of PPAPDC1B, which encodes a transmembrane phosphatase, as a
  therapeutic target was further shown by the strong inhibition of growth of breast
  tumor xenografts displaying 8p11-12 amplification induced by the silencing of PPAPDC1B.
  The oncogenic properties of PPAPDC1B were further shown by its ability to transform
  NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, inducing their anchorage-independent growth. Finally, microarray
  experiments on PPAPDC1B knockdown indicated that this gene interfered with multiple
  cell signaling pathways, including the Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer
  and activator of transcription, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase
  C pathways. PPAPDC1B may also potentiate the estrogen receptor pathway by down-regulating
  DUSP22.
