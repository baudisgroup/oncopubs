abstract: Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung represent a wide spectrum of phenotypically
  distinct entities with different biological characteristics such as typical carcinoid
  tumor TC , atypical carcinoid tumor AC , large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma LCNEC
  , and small-cell lung carcinoma SCLC . The histogenetic relationships between TC,
  AC, LCNEC, and SCLC are still unclear. This study was carried out to provide cytogenetic
  data about pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors and to evaluate their characteristic
  alterations and histogenetic relations for an improved understanding of the mechanisms
  of tumor development. Twenty-nine paraffin-embedded tumor samples of TC n 17 , AC
  n 6 , LCNEC n 3 , and SCLC n 3 were selected for isolation of tumor DNA and subsequent
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis. To confirm the comparative genomic
  hybridization results for characteristic chromosomal imbalances, selected cases
  were additionally investigated by loss of heterozygosity analysis. For statistical
  evaluation, we also used comparative genomic hybridization data from 45 published
  SCLC cases. DNA underrepresentations of 11q were the most frequent findings in TC
  8 of 17 and AC 4 of 6 , whereas these aberrations were rare in LCNEC 1 of 3 and
  SCLC 0 of 3 . Furthermore, AC showed DNA underrepresentation of 10q 3 of 6 and 13q
  3 of 6 . In contrast, SCLC and LCNEC were characterized by a different pattern of
  DNA losses 3p-, 4q-, 5q-, 13q-, and 15q- and gains 5p , 17p , and 20 . Statistical
  analysis revealed significantly different occurrences of 11q deletions in TC AC
  versus SCLC 45 published cases of SCLC and our 3 cases P 0.002 Fishers exact test
  . Thus, TC and AC display frequent loss of 11q material including the MEN1 gene
  locus, which represents a characteristic genetic alteration in these tumors. Losses
  of 10q and 13q sequences allow a further cytogenetic differentiation between TC
  and AC. These additional changes might be responsible for the more aggressive behavior
  of AC. Three cases of LCNEC, the first to be analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization,
  exhibited similar complex abnormal patterns 4q-, 5q-, 10q-, 13q-, 15q- to those
  of SCLC. Although neuroendocrine tumors of the lung share common phenotypic features,
  suggesting a genotypic relationship, they differ remarkably in their cytogenetic
  characteristics, highlighting an early fundamental molecular divergence during the
  development of these tumors.
