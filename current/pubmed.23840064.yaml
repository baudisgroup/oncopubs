abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents a heterogeneous diagnostic
  category with distinct molecular subtypes that can be defined by gene expression
  profiling. However, even within these defined subtypes, heterogeneity prevails.
  To further elucidate the pathogenesis of these entities, we determined the expression
  of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in 248 primary DLBCL
  patient samples. These analyses revealed that loss of PTEN was detectable in 55%
  of germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCLs, whereas this abnormality was found
  in only 14% of non-GCB DLBCL patient samples. In GCB DLBCL, the PTEN status was
  inversely correlated with activation of the oncogenic PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT)
  pathway in both DLBCL cell lines and primary patient samples. Reexpression of PTEN
  induced cytotoxicity in PTEN-deficient GCB DLBCL cell line models by inhibiting
  PI3K/AKT signaling, indicating an addiction to this pathway in this subset of GCB
  DLBCLs. PI3K/AKT inhibition induced down-regulation of the transcription factor
  MYC. Reexpression of MYC rescued GCB DLBCL cells from PTEN-induced toxicity, identifying
  a regulatory mechanism of MYC expression in DLBCL. Finally, pharmacologic PI3K inhibition
  resulted in toxicity selectively in PTEN-deficient GCB DLBCL lines. Collectively,
  our results indicate that PTEN loss defines a PI3K/AKT-dependent GCB DLBCL subtype
  that is addicted to PI3K and MYC signaling and suggest that pharmacologic inhibition
  of PI3K might represent a promising therapeutic approach in these lymphomas.
