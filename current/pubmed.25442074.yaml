abstract: Cytogenetic alterations are strong outcome prognosticators in uveal melanoma
  (UVM). Monosomy 3 (-3) and MYC amplification at 8q24 are commonly tested by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization (FISH). Alternatively, microarray analysis provides whole
  genome data, detecting partial chromosome loss, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or
  abnormalities unrepresented by FISH probes. Nonfixed frozen tissue is conventionally
  used for microarray analysis but may not always be available. We assessed the feasibility
  of genomic microarray analysis for high resolution interrogation of UVM using formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) as an alternative to frozen tissue (FZT). Enucleations
  from 44 patients (clinical trial NCT00952939) yielded sufficient DNA from FFPET
  (n = 34) and/or frozen tissue (n = 41) for comparative genomic hybridization and
  select single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (CGH/SNP) on Roche-NimbleGen OncoChip
  arrays. CEP3 FISH analysis was performed on matched cytology ThinPrep material.
  CGH/SNP analysis was successful in 30 of 34 FFPET and 41 of 41 FZT samples. Of 27
  paired FFPET/FZT samples, 26 (96.3%) were concordant for at least four of six major
  recurrent abnormalities (-3, +8q, -1p, +6p, -6q, -8p), and 25 of 27 (92.6%) were
  concordant for -3. Results of CGH/SNP were concordant with the CEP3 FISH results
  in 27 of 30 (90%) FFPET and 38 of 41 (92.6%) FZT cases; partial -3q was detected
  in two CEP3 FISH-negative cases and whole chromosome 3, 4, and 6 SNP-LOH in one
  case. CGH detection of -3, +8q, -8p on FFPET and FZT showed significant correlation
  with the clinical outcome measures (metastasis development, time to progression,
  survival). Results of the UVM genotyping by CGH/SNP on FFPET are highly concordant
  with those of the FZT analysis and with those of the CEP3 FISH analysis, and therefore
  CGH/SNP is a practical method for UVM prognostication. Genome-wide coverage provides
  additional data with potential relevance to UVM biology, diagnosis, and prognosis.  Copyright
