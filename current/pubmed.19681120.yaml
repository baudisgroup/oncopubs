abstract: Cervical cancer CC is the second most common cancer in women. Currently,
  no tractable molecular-based therapeutic targets exist for patients with invasive
  CC and no predictive markers of risk assessment for progression of precancerous
  lesions are identified. New molecular insights into CC pathogenesis are urgently
  needed. Towards this goal, we first determined the copy number alterations of chromosome
  4 and then examined the role of PCDH10 mapped to 4q28 as a candidate tumor suppressor
  gene. We identified monosomy 4 in 47 of 81 invasive CC studied by SNP array and
  found that 91 of 130 invasive CC harboring methylation in the promoter region of
  the PCDH10 gene. We then showed that aberrant promoter hypermethylation of PCDH10
  is associated with downregulation of gene expression and cell lines exposed to demethylating
  agent resulted in profound reactivated gene expression. We also showed that the
  promoter methylation in the PCDH10 gene occurs at an earliest identifiable stage
  of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Our studies demonstrate that inactivation
  of PCDH10 may be a critical event in CC progression and form a potentially useful
  therapeutic target for CC.
