abstract: We studied 49 choroid plexus tumors by comparative genomic hybridization.
  Chromosomal imbalances were found in 32 of 34 choroid plexus papillomas and 15 of
  15 choroid plexus carcinomas. Choroid plexus papillomas frequently showed 7q 65
  , 5q 62 , 7p 59 , 5p 56 , 9p 50 , 9q 41 , 12p, 12q 38 , and 8q 35 as well as -10q
  56 , -10p, and -22q 47 choroid plexus carcinomas mainly showed 12p, 12q, 20p 60
  , 1, 4q, 20q 53 , 4p 47 , 8q, 14q 40 , 7q, 9p, 21 33 as well as -22q 73 , -5q 40
  , -5p, and -18q 33 . Several chromosomal imbalance differences could be found that
  were characteristic for a tumor entity or age group. In choroid plexus papillomas
  5q, 6q, 7q, 9q, 15q, 18q, and -21q were significantly more common whereas choroid
  plexus carcinomas were characterized by 1, 4q, 10, 14q, 20q, 21q, -5q, -9p, -11,
  -15q, and -18q. Among choroid plexus papillomas, children more often showed 8q,
  14q, 12, and 20q adults mainly presented with 5q, 6q, 15q, 18q, and -22q. Although
  the number of aberrations overall as well as of gains and losses on their own bore
  no significance on survival among choroid plexus tumors, a significantly longer
  survival among patients with choroid plexus carcinomas was associated with 9p and
  -10q. Our results show that aberrations differ between choroid plexus papillomas
  and choroid plexus carcinomas as well as between pediatric and adult choroid plexus
  papillomas, supporting the notion of different genetic pathways. Furthermore, gain
  of 9p and loss of 10q seem to be correlated with a more favorable prognosis in choroid
  plexus carcinomas.
