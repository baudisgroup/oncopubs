abstract: Extranodal malignant non-Hodgkins lymphomas account for about 40 of lymphoid
  neoplasms, but few data are available concerning the genetic background of primary
  gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL . A study was performed of 27 primary
  gastric DLBCLs and 5 gastric DLBCLs with a concomitant low grade component of mucosa-associated
  lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , microsatellite
  studies, classic cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH to search
  for specific genetic aberrations. The most frequent aberrations were losses of material
  on chromosome 6q and gains of parts of chromosome 3. In three cases, a total of
  six high level DNA amplifications were detected, with five of them involving chromosomal
  regions not having been reported before in gastric DLBCL. A high overall concordance
  of 91.4 between microsatellite analysis and CGH was observed using DNA extracted
  from the same tissue block. The concordance achieved using DNA from different tissue
  blocks of the same patient was 85 . Microsatellite studies, CGH, FISH, and classic
  cytogenetics represent complementary techniques that facilitate a comprehensive
  view of genetic alterations in malignancies such as primary gastric DLBCL.
