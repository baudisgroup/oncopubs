abstract: While much information has been reported on the genetic alterations in breast
  cancers of Caucasians, little is known about the Oriental populations where breast
  cancers currently rank the second most common neoplasm. As a first step toward understanding
  the underlying genetics changes in this population, we used comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to the genome-wide analysis of forty pT2 tumors from patients
  of a racially homogenous population in southern China. A complex pattern of genetic
  alterations emerged with the commonest chromosomal gains identified on 1q 58 , 8q
  55 , 11q13 25 , 16p 28 , 17q 53 and 20q 35 , and frequent losses on 8p 38 , 11q
  28 , 13q 30 and 18q 25 . When breast cancers with and without lymph-node metastasis
  were compared, a higher copy gain of 10p was identified in the node-positive group
  P .036 . An overall increase in the average number of genetic aberrations was also
  identified in the late onset group amp gt 45 years P .042 with a higher incidence
  of genetic losses noted P .035 . In particular, losses on 16q were detected in 30
  of the late onset patients but none in the early onsets P 0.049 . In this study,
  we have illustrated the pattern of genetic changes in breast tumors of southern
  Chinese females. While frequent 1q, 8q, 17q and 20q gains, and common 8p and 13q
  deletions detected were consistent to those aberrations reported from the Caucasian
  populations, the difference in genetic changes associated in lymph-node metastasis
  and age of onset identified should provide the basis for additional investigations
  into the underlying tumorigenesis in the Oriental population.
