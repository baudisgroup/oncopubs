abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. Recent
  isolation and characterization of brain tumor-initiating cells supports the concept
  that transformed neural stem cells may seed glioblastoma. We previously identified
  a wide array of mesenchymal tissue transcripts overexpressed in a broad set of primary
  glioblastoma de novo tumors but not in secondary glioblastoma derived from lower-grade
  tumors, low-grade astrocytomas, or normal brain tissues. Here, we extend this observation
  and show that a subset of primary glioblastoma tumors and their derived tumor lines
  express cellular and molecular markers that are associated with mesenchymal stem
  cells MSC and that glioblastoma cell cultures can be induced to differentiate into
  multiple mesenchymal lineage-like cell types. These findings suggest either that
  a subset of primary glioblastomas derive from transformed stem cells containing
  MSC-like properties and retain partial phenotypic aspects of a MSC nature in tumors
  or that glioblastomas activate a series of genes that result in mesenchymal properties
  of the cancer cells to effect sustained tumor growth and malignant progression.
