abstract: "Undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcomas (UPSs) display aggressive
  clinical behavior and frequently develop local recurrence and distant metastasis.
  Because these sarcomas often share similar morphological patterns with other tumors,
  particularly leiomyosarcomas (LMSs), classification by exclusion is frequently used.
  In this study, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used
  to analyze 20 UPS and 17 LMS samples from untreated patients. The LMS samples presented
  a lower frequency of genomic alterations compared with the UPS samples. The most
  frequently altered UPS regions involved gains at 20q13.33 and 7q22.1 and losses
  at 3p26.3. Gains at 8q24.3 and 19q13.12 and losses at 9p21.3 were frequently detected
  in the LMS samples. Of these regions, gains at 1q21.3, 11q12.2-q12.3, 16p11.2, and
  19q13.12 were significantly associated with reduced overall survival times in LMS
  patients. A multivariate analysis revealed that gains at 1q21.3 were an independent
  prognostic marker of shorter survival times in LMS patients (HRâ\x80\x8A=â\x80\x8A13.76;
  Pâ\x80\x8A=â\x80\x8A0.019). Although the copy number profiles of the UPS and LMS
  samples could not be distinguished using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis,
  one of the three clusters presented cases associated with poor prognostic outcome
  (Pâ\x80\x8A=â\x80\x8A0.022). A relative copy number analysis for the ARNT, SLC27A3,
  and PBXIP1 genes was performed using quantitative real-time PCR in 11 LMS and 16
  UPS samples. Gains at 1q21-q22 were observed in both tumor types, particularly in
  the UPS samples. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a genomic
  signature to predict poor outcome in a subset of UPS and LMS patients."
