abstract: The common risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancer are tobacco smoking
  and alcohol consumption, and recently the human papillomavirus HPV was shown to
  be involved in a subgroup. HPV-positive and -negative carcinomas can be distinguished
  on basis of their genetic profiles. Aim of this study was to investigate patterns
  of chromosomal aberrations of HPV-negative oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell
  carcinomas OOSCC in order to improve stratification of patients regarding outcome.
  Thirty-nine OOSCCs were classified on basis of their genetic pattern determined
  by array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . Resulting groups were related
  to patient and tumor characteristics using the Fishers exact test and in addition
  to survival with the Kaplan-Meier and log rank tests. Classification distinguished
  three groups, one characterized by hardly any chromosomal aberration N 8 and another
  by a relatively high level N 26 , and one with a very high level N 5 of chromosomal
  aberrations. This classification was significantly p 0.003 associated with survival,
  with the best survival in the genetically silent group and the worst survival in
  the most aberrant group. The silent profile was significantly p amp lt 0.05 associated
  with wild-type TP53, an absence of alcohol consumption and a female gender. These
  carcinomas were negative for microsatellite instability. This classification of
  OOSCC was confirmed in an independent set of 89 oral carcinomas. In conclusion,
  the discovery of these new classes of oral and oropharyngeal cancer with unique
  genetic and clinical characteristics has important consequences for future basic
  and clinical studies.
