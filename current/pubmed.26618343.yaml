abstract: Gliomas represent approximately 30% of all central nervous system tumors
  and 80% of malignant brain tumors. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
  the malignant progression of low-grade gliomas with mutations in IDH1 (encoding
  isocitrate dehydrogenase 1), we studied paired tumor samples from 41 patients, comparing
  higher-grade, progressed samples to their lower-grade counterparts. Integrated genomic
  analyses, including whole-exome sequencing and copy number, gene expression and
  DNA methylation profiling, demonstrated nonlinear clonal expansion of the original
  tumors and identified oncogenic pathways driving progression. These include activation
  of the MYC and RTK-RAS-PI3K pathways and upregulation of the FOXM1- and E2F2-mediated
  cell cycle transitions, as well as epigenetic silencing of developmental transcription
  factor genes bound by Polycomb repressive complex 2 in human embryonic stem cells.
  Our results not only provide mechanistic insight into the genetic and epigenetic
  mechanisms driving glioma progression but also identify inhibition of the bromodomain
  and extraterminal (BET) family as a potential therapeutic approach.
