abstract: To compare the differences in DNA aberrations between arsenic-exposed and
  non-arsenic-exposed transitional cell carcinoma TCC , we analyzed 19 arsenic-exposed
  and 29 non-arsenic-exposed urinary TCCs from Chi-Mei Hospital using comparative
  genomic hybridization. DNA aberrations were detected in 42 TCCs including 19 arsenic-exposed
  and 23 non-arsenic-exposed TCCs. Arsenic-exposed TCCs had more changes than unexposed
  TCCs mean -SD, 6.6 -2.9 vs. 2.9 -2.2 . Arsenic exposure was significantly associated
  with the number of DNA aberrations after adjustment for tumor stage, tumor grade
  and cigarette smoking in multiple regression analysis. The most frequent DNA gains,
  which were strikingly different between arsenic-exposed and non-arsenic-exposed
  TCCs, included those at 1p, 4p, 4q and 8q. A much higher frequency of DNA losses
  in arsenic-exposed TCCs compared with non-arsenic-exposed TCCs was observed in 10q,
  11p and 17p. Chromosomal loss in 17p13 was associated not only with arsenic exposure,
  but also with tumor stage and grade. The p53 immunohistochemistry staining showed
  that chromosome 17p13 loss was associated with either p53 no expression 25 or p53
  overexpression 75 . The findings suggest that long-term arsenic exposure may increase
  the chromosome abnormality in TCC, and 17p loss plays an important role in arsenic-induced
  urinary carcinogenesis.
