abstract: 'Intratumor heterogeneity in chromosomal aberrations is believed to represent
  a major challenge in the treatment of cancer. The aim of our work was to assess
  the chromosomal heterogeneity of advanced cervical carcinomas and to distinguish
  aberrations that had occurred at a late stage of the disease from early events.
  A total of 55 biopsies, sampled from 2-4 different sites within 20 tumors, were
  analyzed by use of comparative genomic hybridization. Heterogeneous aberrations
  were identified as those present in at least 1 of the biopsies and which were not
  seen, nor seen as a tendency, in the others of the same tumor. The homogeneous aberrations
  were those seen in all biopsies of the tumor. The most frequent homogeneous aberrations
  were gain of 3q 65 , 20q 65 and 5p 50 , indicating that these are early events in
  the development of the disease. Chromosomal heterogeneity was observed in 11 tumors.
  The most frequent heterogeneous aberrations were loss of 4p14-q25 60 of 10 cases
  with this aberration , and gain of 2p22-pter 50 of 6 cases , 11qcen-q13 33 of 9
  cases and 8q 27 of 11 cases , suggesting that these events promote progression at
  a later stage. Many of the heterogeneous regions contained genes known to influence
  the prognosis of cervical cancer, such as 7p EGFR , 8q c-MYC , 11qcen-q13 CCND1
  and 17q ERBB2 . Three evolution sequences for the subpopulations in the heterogeneous
  tumors were identified: a serial, a parallel and a mixed sequence. In 2 tumors with
  a serial sequence, it was indicated that the aberrations 8 and -X had occurred after
  the other heterogeneous aberrations and hence were the aberrations most recently
  formed. Our results suggest pronounced chromosomal instability in advanced cervical
  carcinomas. Moreover, aggressive and treatment-resistant subpopulations may emerge
  at a late stage and possibly contribute to a poor prognosis of the advanced stages.'
