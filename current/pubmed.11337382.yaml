abstract: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma SMZL has recently been recognized in the
  World Health Organization classification of hematological diseases as distinct type
  of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In contrast to the well-established chromosomal changes
  associated with other B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma, few genetic alterations have
  been found associated with SMZL. The aim of our study was to analyze by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH the chromosomal imbalances in 29 patients with SMZL and
  to correlate these findings with clinical and biological characteristics and patient
  outcome. In 21 cases, cytogenetic studies were simultaneously performed. Most of
  the patients 83 displayed genomic imbalances. A total of 111 DNA copy number changes
  were detected with a median of four abnormalities per case range, 1 to 12 . Gains
  n 92 were more frequent than losses n 16 , while three high-level amplifications
  3q26-q29, 5p11-p15, and 17q22-q25 were observed. The most frequent gains involved
  3q 31 , 5q 28 , 12q and 20q 24 each , 9q 21 , and 4q 17 . Losses were observed in
  7q 14 and 17p 10 . SMZL patients with genetic losses had a shorter survival than
  the remaining SMZL patients P amp lt 0.05 . In summary, chromosomal imbalances in
  regions 3q, 4q, 5q, 7q, 9q, 12q, and 20q have been detected by CGH in SMZL. Patients
  with SMZL displaying genetic losses by CGH had a short survival.
