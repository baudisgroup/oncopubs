abstract: Soft-tissue sarcomas, which result in approximately 10,700 diagnoses and
  3,800 deaths per year in the United States, show remarkable histologic diversity,
  with more than 50 recognized subtypes. However, knowledge of their genomic alterations
  is limited. We describe an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number and
  mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Frequently mutated
  genes included TP53 17 of pleomorphic liposarcomas , NF1 10.5 of myxofibrosarcomas
  and 8 of pleomorphic liposarcomas and PIK3CA 18 of myxoid round-cell liposarcomas,
  or MRCs . PIK3CA mutations in MRCs were associated with Akt activation and poor
  clinical outcomes. In myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, we found both
  point mutations and genomic deletions affecting the tumor suppressor NF1. Finally,
  we found that short hairpin RNA shRNA -based knockdown of several genes amplified
  in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.
  Our study yields a detailed map of molecular alterations across diverse sarcoma
  subtypes and suggests potential subtype-specific targets for therapy.
