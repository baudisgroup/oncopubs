abstract: Endometrial hyperplasia is a common disorder that is now observed with increasing
  frequency in women treated with hormonal replacement therapy or with tamoxifen.
  This study was undertaken to determine whether genomic features of various forms
  of endometrial hyperplasias would allow their classification as a benign, premalignant,
  or malignant abnormality. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was performed on
  endometrial glands microdissected by laser capture microscope from 19 archival endometrial
  samples, comprising 5 normal endometria, 1 polyp, 2 simple hyperplasias, 5 hyperplasias
  with nuclear abnormalities atypical hyperplasias , and 4 low-grade and 2 high-grade
  endometrioid carcinomas, 1 with squamous component adenoacanthoma . Genomic DNA,
  extracted from the glands and the squamous component in 1 case, was amplified by
  degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR and compared
  with sex-matched DNA by CGH. No genomic imbalances were observed in the normal samples,
  the polyp, or the simple hyperplasias. However, in atypical hyperplasia, regardless
  of the level of cytologic atypia, genomic abnormalities were observed that also
  occurred in endometrioid carcinomas. Chromosomes 1, 8, and 10 were most often affected.
  The results are compared with molecular genetic abnormalities recently reported
  in these lesions. This study strongly suggests that atypical endometrial hyperplasias
  are closely related to endometrioid carcinoma and should be considered precancerous
  lesions, contrary to simple hyperplasia, which is a benign disorder. The squamous
  component of one of the high-grade carcinomas showed genetic abnormalities similar
  to those of endometrioid carcinoma and therefore does not represent squamous metaplasia
  but is an integral part of the malignant process.
