abstract: Renal cell carcinoma with rhabdoid differentiation (RCC-R) in adult patients
  is an aggressive variant of renal cancer with no known specific genetic alterations.
  The aim of this study was to characterize genome-wide genetic aberrations in RCC-R
  via utilization of high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We
  identified 20 cases of RCC-R, which displayed both clear cell renal cell carcinoma
  and rhabdoid histomorphologic components. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed,
  paraffin-embedded tissue (from clear cell renal cell carcinoma and RCC-R areas from
  each case) and subjected to high-density SNP array assay. Genetic aberrations present
  in 10% of cases were considered significant. In areas with clear cell histomorphology,
  gains were most commonly observed in chromosomes 5q (66.7%, 10/15), 7 (46.7%, 7/15),
  and 8q (46.7%, 7/15); and losses were most commonly identified in chromosomes 14
  (60%, 9/15), 8p (46.7%, 7/15), and 22 (46.7%, 7/15). In areas with rhabdoid differentiation,
  gains were most commonly observed in chromosome 7 (58.8%, 10/17); and losses were
  most commonly identified in chromosomes 9 (70.6%, 12/17), 14 (58.8%, 10/17), 4 (52.9%,
  9/17), and 17p (52.9%, 9/17). Rhabdoid cells shared many chromosomal abnormalities
  and exhibited a greater number of copy number variations in comparison with coexisting
  clear cells. Loss of 11p was specific for rhabdoid differentiation, with loss found
  in 29.4% of rhabdoid components compared with 0% of clear cell areas. The greater
  number of overall genetic alterations in the rhabdoid cells and the shared genetic
  background between rhabdoid and clear cell areas suggest genetic evolution of the
  rhabdoid cells that correlates with histomorphologic progression.  Copyright ï¿½
