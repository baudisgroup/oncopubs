abstract: Genomes of solid tumors are characterized by gains and losses of regions,
  which may contribute to tumorigenesis by altering gene expression. Often the aberrations
  are extensive, encompassing whole chromosome arms, which makes identification of
  candidate genes in these regions difficult. Here, we focused on narrow regions of
  gene amplification to facilitate identification of genetic pathways important in
  oral squamous cell carcinoma SCC development. We used array comparative genomic
  hybridization array CGH to define minimum common amplified regions and then used
  expression analysis to identify candidate driver genes in amplicons that spanned
  amp lt 3 Mb. We found genes involved in integrin signaling TLN1 , survival YAP1,
  BIRC2 , and adhesion and migration TLN1, LAMA3, MMP7 , as well as members of the
  hedgehog GLI2 and notch JAG1, RBPSUH, FJX1 pathways to be amplified and overexpressed.
  Deregulation of these and other members of the hedgehog and notch pathways HHIP,
  SMO, DLL1, NOTCH4 implicates deregulation of developmental and differentiation pathways,
  cell fate misspecification, in oral SCC development.
