abstract: Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma UES is the third most common hepatic
  malignancy in children. Previous reports have described a broad range of complex
  cytogenetic abnormalities in individual cases of hepatic UES. Herein we report the
  cytogenetic findings of six cases of hepatic UES at our institution analyzed by
  conventional cytogenetic methods and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The
  CGH demonstrated several chromosomal gains and deletions in each case, but there
  was no specific abnormality seen in every case. Patterns of chromosomal changes
  included gains of chromosome 1q four cases , 5p four cases , 6q four cases , 8p
  three cases , and 12q three cases , and losses of chromosome 9p two cases , 11p
  two cases , and chromosome 14 three cases . The three cases in which CGH showed
  gains in the 12q region were studied specifically for amplifications of MDM2 and
  CDK4, two genes that have been shown to be amplified in other soft tissue sarcomas.
  However, Southern analysis showed no amplification of MDM2 or CDK4 in these three
  cases. Further analysis will be needed to determine the critical events in the pathogenesis
  of these malignant pediatric liver tumors.
