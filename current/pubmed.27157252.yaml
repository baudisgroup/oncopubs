abstract: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a benign condition
  with an approximate 1% annual risk of symptomatic plasma cell disorder development,
  mostly to multiple myeloma (MM). We performed genomewide screening of copy-number
  alterations (CNAs) in 90 MGUS and 33 MM patients using high-density DNA microarrays.
  We identified CNAs in a smaller proportion of MGUS (65.6%) than in MM (100.0%, P
  = 1.31 ï¿½ 10(-5) ) and showed median number of CNAs is lower in MGUS (3, range
  0-22) than in MM (13, range 4-38, P = 1.82 ï¿½ 10(-10) ). In the MGUS cohort, the
  most frequent losses were located at 1p (5.6%), 6q (6.7%), 13q (30.0%), 14q (14.4%),
  16q (8.9%), 21q (5.6%), and gains at 1q (23.3%), 2p (6.7%), 6p (13.3%), and Xq (7.8%).
  Hyperdiploidy was detected in 38.9% of MGUS cases, and the most frequent whole chromosome
  gains were 3 (25.6%), 5 (23.3%), 9 (37.8%), 15 (23.3%), and 19 (32.2%). We also
  identified CNAs such as 1p, 6q, 8p, 12p, 13q, 16q losses, 1q gain and hypodiploidy,
  which are potentially associated with an adverse prognosis in MGUS. In summary,
  we showed that MGUS is similar to MM in that it is a genetically heterogeneous disorder,
  but overall cytogenetic instability is lower than in MM, which confirms that genetic
  abnormalities play important role in monoclonal gammopathies.
