abstract: Superficial spreading melanoma SSM and nodular melanoma NM are believed
  to represent sequential phases of linear progression from radial to vertical growth.
  Several lines of clinical, pathologic, and epidemiologic evidence suggest, however,
  that SSM and NM might be the result of independent pathways of tumor development.
  We utilized an integrative genomic approach that combines single nucleotide polymorphism
  array 6.0 Affymetrix with gene expression array U133A 2.0 Affymetrix to examine
  molecular differences between SSM and NM. Pathway analysis of the most differentially
  expressed genes between SSM and NM N 114 revealed significant differences related
  to metabolic processes. We identified 8 genes DIS3, FGFR1OP, G3BP2, GALNT7, MTAP,
  SEC23IP, USO1, and ZNF668 in which NM SSM-specific copy number alterations correlated
  with differential gene expression P lt 0.05 Spearmans rank . SSM-specific genomic
  deletions in G3BP2, MTAP, and SEC23IP were independently verified in two external
  data sets. Forced overexpression of metabolism-related gene MTAP methylthioadenosine
  phosphorylase in SSM resulted in reduced cell growth. The differential expression
  of another metabolic-related gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 ALDH7A1 , was validated
  at the protein level by using tissue microarrays of human melanoma. In addition,
  we show that the decreased ALDH7A1 expression in SSM may be the result of epigenetic
  modifications. Our data reveal recurrent genomic deletions in SSM not present in
  NM, which challenge the linear model of melanoma progression. Furthermore, our data
  suggest a role for altered regulation of metabolism-related genes as a possible
  cause of the different clinical behavior of SSM and NM.
