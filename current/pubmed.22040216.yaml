abstract: Most high-risk neuroblastomas develop resistance to cytostatics and therefore
  there is a need to develop new drugs. In previous studies, we found that ellipticine
  induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells. We also investigated whether ellipticine
  was able to induce resistance in the UKF-NB-4 neuroblastoma line and concluded that
  it may be possible after long-term treatment with increasing concentrations of ellipticine.
  The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms responsible for ellipticine
  resistance. To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we used the ellipticine-resistant
  subline UKF-NB-4 ELLI and performed comparative genomic hybridization, multicolor
  and interphase FISH, expression microarray, real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry and
  western blotting analysis of proteins. On the basis of our results, it appears that
  ellipticine resistance in neuroblastoma is caused by a combination of overexpression
  of Bcl-2, efflux or degradation of the drug and downregulation of topoisomerases.
  Other mechanisms, such as upregulation of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation,
  cellular respiration, V-ATPases, aerobic respiration or spermine synthetase, as
  well as reduced growth rate, may also be involved. Some changes are expressed at
  the DNA level, including gains, amplifications or deletions. The present study demonstrates
  that resistance to ellipticine is caused by a combination of mechanisms.
