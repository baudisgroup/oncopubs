abstract: Langerhans cell histiocytosis LCH is a disorder of unknown etiology that
  gives rise to clonal expansion of Langerhans-like cells or their precursors. The
  molecular basis include aberrant expression of several adhesion molecules and elevated
  expression of p53, c-myc, and H-ras. To identify new locations of LCH-related oncogenes
  or tumor-suppressor genes, we performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH and
  loss of heterozygosity LOH analysis on a series of 7 bone LCH lesions. Recurrent
  abnormalities were found by the CGH in all cases representing losses of DNA sequences
  on chromosomes 1p, 5, 6, 7, 9, 16, 17, and 22q. Gain of DNA copy number was seen
  on chromosomes 2q, 4q, and 12. The CGH data were supplemented by LOH analysis by
  means of 85 polymorphic microsatellite markers distributed along chromosomes 1,
  7, 9, and 22. The highest frequency of LOH was found on 1p region in 3 of 7 informative
  cases and on chromosome 7 in 4 cases. Allelic loss was also detected on chromosomes
  9 in 2 of 7 informative cases and on 22q in 1 of 7 cases. These results indicate
  that the deleted chromosomal segments may contain genes important in LCH initiation
  and progression.
