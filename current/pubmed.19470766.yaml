abstract: 'Recent insights into the role of the von-Hippel Lindau VHL tumor suppressor
  gene in hereditary and sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC have led to
  new treatments for patients with metastatic ccRCC, although virtually all patients
  eventually succumb to the disease. We performed an integrated, genome-wide analysis
  of copy-number changes and gene expression profiles in 90 tumors, including both
  sporadic and VHL disease-associated tumors, in hopes of identifying new therapeutic
  targets in ccRCC. We identified 14 regions of nonrandom copy-number change, including
  7 regions of amplification 1q, 2q, 5q, 7q, 8q, 12p, and 20q and 7 regions of deletion
  1p, 3p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 14q . An analysis aimed at identifying the relevant
  genes revealed VHL as one of three genes in the 3p deletion peak, CDKN2A and CDKN2B
  as the only genes in the 9p deletion peak, and MYC as the only gene in the 8q amplification
  peak. An integrated analysis to identify genes in amplification peaks that are consistently
  overexpressed among amplified samples confirmed MYC as a potential target of 8q
  amplification and identified candidate oncogenes in the other regions. A comparison
  of genomic profiles revealed that VHL disease-associated tumors are similar to a
  subgroup of sporadic tumors and thus more homogeneous overall. Sporadic tumors without
  evidence of biallelic VHL inactivation fell into two groups: one group with genomic
  profiles highly dissimilar to the majority of ccRCC and a second group with genomic
  profiles that are much more similar to tumors with biallelic inactivation of VHL.'
