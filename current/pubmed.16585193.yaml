abstract: Although neuroblastoma is characterized by numerous recurrent, large-scale
  chromosomal imbalances, the genes targeted by such imbalances have remained elusive.
  We have applied whole-genome oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization
  median probe spacing 6 kb to 56 neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines to identify
  genes involved with disease pathogenesis. This set of tumors was selected for having
  either 11q loss or MYCN amplification, abnormalities that define the two most common
  genetic subtypes of metastatic neuroblastoma. Our analyses have permitted us to
  map large-scale chromosomal imbalances and high-level amplifications at exon-level
  resolution and to identify novel microdeletions and duplications. Chromosomal breakpoints
  n 467 generating imbalances amp gt 2 Mb were mapped to intervals ranging between
  6 and 50 kb in size, providing substantial information on each abnormality. For
  example, breakpoints leading to large-scale hemizygous loss of chromosome 11q were
  highly clustered and preferentially associated with segmental duplications. High-level
  amplifications of MYCN were extremely complex, often resulting in a series of discontinuous
  regions of amplification. Imbalances n 540 amp lt 2 Mb long were also detected.
  Although the majority 78 of these imbalances mapped to segmentally duplicated regions
  and primarily reflect constitutional copy number polymorphisms, many subtle imbalances
  were detected that are likely somatically acquired alterations and include genes
  involved with tumorigenesis, apoptosis, or neural cell differentiation. The most
  frequent microdeletion involved the PTPRD locus, indicating a possible tumor suppressor
  function for this gene.
