abstract: Little is known about genetic mutations during the malignant progression
  of spinal meningiomas. This study investigated genomic changes across the entire
  genome in spinal meningioma samples to determine possible mechanism s of tumorigenesis.
  Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 16 spinal meningiomas were analyzed by the
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH technique. Lymphocytes of the patients were
  evaluated as controls. Genomic change was detected in 11 samples. Complete or partial
  loss of chromosome 22 was the most commonly seen abnormality in eight cases. Chromosome
  losses on 1p, 9p, and 10q and gains on 5p and 17q were the other abnormalities.
  These changes are all frequently seen in meningiomas, but are mostly specific to
  atypical and anaplastic meningiomas. However, in the present study, copy number
  changes on chromosomes 9p 3 samples , 17q 2 samples , and 1p 2 samples were seen
  even in the benign tumors. Our results suggest that in addition to the neurofibromatosis
  type 2 tumor suppressor gene, other cancer-related genes located on 1p, 9p, 10q,
  and 17q might be involved in the etiology of spinal meningiomas.
