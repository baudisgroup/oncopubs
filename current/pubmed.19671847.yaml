abstract: In cases of multiple non-small cell lung cancer, clinicians must decide
  whether patients have independent tumors or metastases and tailor treatment accordingly.
  Decisions are currently made using the Martini and Melamed criteria, which are mostly
  based on tumor location and histologic type. New genomic tools could improve the
  ability to assess tumor clonality.
