abstract: Genomic copy number aberrations CNAs in gastric cancer have already been
  extensively characterized by array comparative genomic hybridization array CGH analysis.
  However, involvement of genomic CNAs in the process of submucosal invasion and lymph
  node metastasis in early gastric cancer is still poorly understood. In this study,
  to address this issue, we collected a total of 59 tumor samples from 27 patients
  with submucosal-invasive gastric cancers SMGC , analyzed their genomic profiles
  by array CGH, and compared them between paired samples of mucosal MU and submucosal
  SM invasion 23 pairs , and SM invasion and lymph node LN metastasis 9 pairs . Initially,
  we hypothesized that acquisition of specific CNA s is important for these processes.
  However, we observed no significant difference in the number of genomic CNAs between
  paired MU and SM, and between paired SM and LN. Furthermore, we were unable to find
  any CNAs specifically associated with SM invasion or LN metastasis. Among the 23
  cases analyzed, 15 had some similar pattern of genomic profiling between SM and
  MU. Interestingly, 13 of the 15 cases also showed some differences in genomic profiles.
  These results suggest that the majority of SMGCs are composed of heterogeneous subpopulations
  derived from the same clonal origin. Comparison of genomic CNAs between SMGCs with
  and without LN metastasis revealed that gain of 11q13, 11q14, 11q22, 14q32 and amplification
  of 17q21 were more frequent in metastatic SMGCs, suggesting that these CNAs are
  related to LN metastasis of early gastric cancer. In conclusion, our data suggest
  that generation of genetically distinct subclones, rather than acquisition of specific
  CNA at MU, is integral to the process of submucosal invasion, and that subclones
  that acquire gain of 11q13, 11q14, 11q22, 14q32 or amplification of 17q21 are likely
  to become metastatic.
