abstract: The prognosis in children harboring a glioblastoma multiforme GBM is usually
  poor. Few GBMs in children, however, seem to respond quite well to adjuvant chemotherapy.
  The biological basis for such chemotherapy sensitivity remains uncertain. In this
  paper the authors report the case of a 2-month-old girl with a histologically confirmed
  GBM WHO Grade IV in whom chemotherapy was accompanied by differentiation of the
  malignant primary tumor into a typical gangliocytoma WHO Grade I showing ganglioid
  differentiation and expression of neuronal markers synaptophysin, neurofilament,
  and NeuN as well as a low Ki 67 MIB-1 proliferation index. Array-comparative genomic
  hybridization did not reveal genetic alterations in either specimen. Even though
  the underlying biological mechanisms remain to be elucidated, closer examination
  of frequency and prognostic significance of neuronal differentiation in pediatric
  GBMs within ongoing and future clinical trials may be warranted.
