abstract: Multiple primary malignant neoplasms are not uncommon, whereas 2 different
  types of primary sarcomas simultaneously presenting in 1 individual is quite unusual.
  We encountered a patient presenting with a uterine sarcoma and another retroperitoneal
  mass at the same time. These 2 tumors showed distinct pathologic and immunohistochemical
  features. The diagnosis of a synchronous presentation of a uterine leiomyosarcoma
  and a retroperitoneal sclerosing well-differentiated liposarcoma was rendered. Further
  study by comparative genomic hybridization showed unrelated genomic alterations
  of these 2 tumors. Nevertheless, other common genetic alterations such as balanced
  translocations, point mutations, or epigenetic modifications could still exist because
  of the limitation of findings by comparative genomic hybridization. In conclusion,
  both metastasis and multiple primary tumors should always be taken into consideration
  in differential diagnosis while encountering synchronous sarcomas.
