abstract: 'Tumors of the central nervous system are the second most frequent malignancy
  of childhood, accounting for the majority of cancer-related deaths in this age group.
  Among these tumors, medulloblastomas MB remain in need of further genomic characterization
  toward understanding of pathogenesis and outcome predictors. Eight pediatric embryonal
  brain tumors were analyzed: five MB one being desmoplastic , one PNET, one medulloepithelioma,
  and one ependymoblastoma. Analyses identified genomic imbalances, including the
  gain of 16p and the nonsyntenic coamplification of MYCN and TERT loci. More detailed
  FISH analysis showed that coamplification of MYCN and TERT in one of the MBs manifested
  as dispersed nuclear speckling, consistent with the presence of double minute chromosomes.
  There was considerable cell-to-cell copy number heterogeneity present, but it was
  clear that both genes were amplified concordantly. The amplification of oncogenes
  seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MB, and the association between
  MYCN and TERT amplifications and poor prognosis has not been well recognized. The
  uncharacteristic pattern of genomic imbalances detected in MB tumors may be a reflection
  of the characteristics of these tumors occurring in South America.'
