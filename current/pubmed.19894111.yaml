abstract: 'Large genomic rearrangements are estimated to account for approximately
  5-10 of all disease-causing mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in patients with
  hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome HBOC . We use MRC-Holland Multiplex
  Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification MLPA to screen for such rearrangements in
  patients with HBOC and as a first step in our genetic testing workflow. The technique
  was applied to a set of 310 independent patients and detected eight different copy
  number alterations, corresponding to 2.6 of the studied samples. MLPA was also found
  to identify point mutations located in probe sequences. As commercial MLPA tests
  are not suitable for determining the specific breakpoints or for defining the exact
  extent of rearrangements, we applied a set of different complementary techniques
  to characterize these genetic alterations with greater precision. Long-range PCR
  amplification, RNA analysis, SNP-array chips, non-commercial MLPA probes, and FISH
  analysis were used to fully define the extent and mechanism of each alteration.
  In BRCA1, six rearrangements were characterized: deletion of E22, duplication of
  E9-E24, deletion of E16-E23, deletion of E1-E13, deletion of E1-E2 and duplication
  of E1-E2. In BRCA2, we studied a deletion of E15-E16 and a deletion of E1-E24. To
  the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of the nature and
  underlying molecular causes of these mutational events in the BRCA1 2 genes.'
