abstract: HIV-infected individuals have a significantly increased risk of developing
  an aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma relative to HIV - persons. Due to their
  aggressive nature, AIDS-related lymphomas ARL can also be more difficult to classify.
  Genetic abnormalities are known to play a significant role in HIV - lymphomagenesis.
  To aid in case classification and identify key pathogenetic events in ARL, we analyzed
  gene expression data and somatic DNA copy number changes by high-resolution array
  comparative genomic hybridization in tumors from 20 B-cell derived ARL B-ARL patients.
  Gene expression-based predictors robustly classified the B-ARL cases, distinguishing
  Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and identifying activated B-cell
  like and germinal center B-cell like molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell
  lymphoma. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed 13 recurrent
  losses and 16 recurrent gains in the B-ARL cases, including gain of 19p13.2 and
  loss of 16q23, not previously reported in B-ARL. The WWOX tumor suppressor gene
  was characterized as a candidate gene for the 16q23.1 locus and showed gene silencing
  or truncated transcript in 9 of 16 cases. These data demonstrate the ability to
  molecularly classify B-ARL lymphomas by gene expression and identified DNA copy
  number alterations targeted in B-ARL.
