abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect and map the regions
  of gain, high-level amplification, and loss of DNA sequences in 14 liposarcomas.
  Thirteen tumors showed DNA sequence copy number changes of one or more genomic regions
  mean, six aberrations tumor range, 0-17 . These aberrations were observed in almost
  every chromosome but some chromosomal regions were affected more often than others.
  DNA sequence gains were more frequent than losses. The most common gain was seen
  at 12q14-21 50 of tumors . Other frequent gains 29 were of 1q21-24, 8cen-q21.2,
  19q, and 20q. High-level amplification was observed in six 43 tumors and included
  as minimal common segments bands 12q15, 1q22, and 1q24. In five 36 tumors, sequences
  at 1q21-24 and 1q32 were found to be gained simultaneously with 12q14-21, which
  means that in 71 of the tumors with gain at 12q, an increase of DNA sequence copy
  number at 1q was also observed. The most common losses of DNA sequences 21 occurred
  from regions 9p21-pter and 13q21-qter. Most of the aforementioned regions have not
  previously been reported to be altered in liposarcomas. The detection of a novel
  recurring amplicon at 1q21-24 with high-level amplification at 1q22 and frequent
  simultaneous DNA sequence gain at 12q14-21 high-level amplification at 12q15 suggests
  that genes linked to both these regions may play a significant role in the development
  and progression of liposarcomas.
