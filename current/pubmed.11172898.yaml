abstract: We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to study DNA copy number changes
  in 71 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL including 50 B-lineage and
  21 T-ALLs. Forty-two patients 59 showed genomic imbalances whereby gains were more
  frequently observed than losses 127 vs. 29 . Gains most commonly affected the entire
  chromosomes 21 and 10 19.7 each , 6, 14, 18, X 15.5 each , 17 14.1 and 4 11.3 .
  Highly hyperdiploid karyotypes chromosome number amp gt 50 occurred more frequently
  in B-lineage than in T-lineage ALL 24 vs. 4.8 . In both cell lineages deletions
  were mainly detected on 9p 14.1 and 12p 8.4 , and on 6q in T-lineage ALL 4.2 . These
  findings were compared with loss of heterozygosity LOH of 6q, 9p, 11q, and 12p previously
  performed in 56 of the 71 patients. Among 54 sites of LOH, CGH revealed losses of
  the respective chromosome arms in 17 LOH-positive regions 31.5 . G-banding analysis
  and interphase cytogenetics with subregional probes for 14 loci confirmed the presence
  of genomic imbalances as detected by CGH. We, therefore, conclude that, in the absence
  of cytogenetic data, CGH represents a suitable method for identifying hyperdiploid
  karyotypes as well as prognostically relevant deletions in ALL patients.
