abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Tumor recurrence remains the major clinical complication of
  meningiomas, the majority of recurrences occurring among WHO grade I benign tumors.
  In the present study, we propose a new scoring system for the prognostic stratification
  of meningioma patients based on analysis of a large series of meningiomas followed
  for a median of 5 years. METHODS: Tumor cytogenetics were systematically investigated
  by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in 302 meningioma samples, and
  the proposed classification was further validated in an independent series of cases
  n 132 analyzed by high-density 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP arrays. RESULTS:
  Overall, we found an adverse impact on patient relapse-free survival RFS for males,
  presence of brain edema, younger patients lt 55 years , tumor size 50 mm, tumor
  localization at intraventricular and anterior cranial base areas, WHO grade II III
  meningiomas, and complex karyotypes the latter 5 variables showed an independent
  predictive value in multivariate analysis. Based on these parameters, a prognostic
  score was established for each individual case, and patients were stratified into
  4 risk categories with significantly different P lt .001 outcomes. These included
  a good prognosis group, consisting of approximately 20 of cases, that showed a RFS
  of 100 - 0 at 10 years and a very poor-prognosis group with a RFS rate of 0 - 0
  at 10 years. The prognostic impact of the scoring system proposed here was also
  retained when WHO grade I cases were considered separately P lt .001 . CONCLUSIONS:
  Based on this risk-stratification classification, different strategies may be adopted
  for follow-up, and eventually also for treatment, of meningioma patients at different
  risks for relapse.'
