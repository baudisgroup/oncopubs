abstract: Although synovial sarcoma is the 3rd most commonly occurring mesenchymal
  tumor in young adults, usually with a highly aggressive clinical course remarkable
  differences can be seen regarding the clinical outcome. According to comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH data published in the literature, the simple and complex
  karyotypes show a correlation between the prognosis and clinical outcome. In addition,
  the connection between DNA ploidy and clinical course is controversial. The aim
  of this study was using a fine-tuning interpretation of our DNA ploidy results and
  to compare these with metaphase high-resolution CGH HR-CGH results.
