abstract: "Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SINET) are the commonest malignancy
  of the small intestine; however, underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly
  characterized. Whole-genome and -exome sequencing has demonstrated that SINETs are
  mutationally quiet, with the most frequent known mutation in the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor 1B gene (CDKN1B) occurring in only â\x88¼8% of tumors, suggesting
  that alternative mechanisms may drive tumorigenesis. The aim of this study is to
  perform genome-wide molecular profiling of SINETs in order to identify pathogenic
  drivers based on molecular profiling. This study represents the largest unbiased
  integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis undertaken in this tumor
  type.Here, we present data from integrated molecular analysis of SINETs (n = 97),
  including whole-exome or targeted CDKN1B sequencing (n = 29), HumanMethylation450
  BeadChip (Illumina) array profiling (n = 69), methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
  sequencing (n = 16), copy-number variance analysis (n = 47), and Whole-Genome DASL
  (Illumina) expression array profiling (n = 43).Based on molecular profiling, SINETs
  can be classified into three groups, which demonstrate significantly different progression-free
  survival after resection of primary tumor (not reached at 10 years vs. 56 months
  vs. 21 months, P = 0.04). Epimutations were found at a recurrence rate of up to
  85%, and 21 epigenetically dysregulated genes were identified, including CDX1 (86%),
  CELSR3 (84%), FBP1 (84%), and GIPR (74%).This is the first comprehensive integrated
  molecular analysis of SINETs. We have demonstrated that these tumors are highly
  epigenetically dysregulated. Furthermore, we have identified novel molecular subtypes
  with significant impact on progression-free survival."
