abstract: PURPOSE Choroid plexus carcinomas are pediatric tumors with poor survival
  rates and a strong, but poorly understood, association with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
  LFS . Currently, with lack of biologic predictors, most children are treated with
  aggressive chemoradiation protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS We established a multi-institutional
  tissue and clinical database, which enabled the analysis of specific alterations
  of the TP53 tumor suppressor and its modifiers in choroid plexus tumors CPTs . We
  conducted high-resolution copy-number analysis to correlate these genetic parameters
  with family history and outcome. Results We studied 64 patients with CPTs. All individuals
  with germline TP53 mutations fulfilled LFS criteria, whereas all patients not meeting
  these criteria harbored wild-type TP53 P amp lt .001 . TP53 mutations were found
  in 50 of choroid plexus carcinomas CPCs . Additionally, two sequence variants known
  to confer TP53 dysfunction, TP53 codon72 and MDM2 SNP309, coexisted in the majority
  of TP53 wild-type CPCs 92 and not in TP53 mutated CPC P .04 , which suggests a complementary
  mechanism of TP53 dysfunction in the absence of a TP53 mutation. High-resolution
  single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array analysis revealed extremely high total
  structural variation TSV in TP53-mutated CPC tumor genomes compared with TP53 wild-type
  tumors and choroid plexus papillomas CPPs P .006 and .004, respectively . Moreover,
  high TSV was associated with significant risk of progression P amp lt .001 . Five-year
  survival rates for patients with TP53-immunopositive and -immunonegative CPCs were
  0 and 82 - 9 , respectively P amp lt .001 . Furthermore, 14 of 16 patients with
  TP53 wild-type CPCs are alive without having received radiation therapy. CONCLUSION
  Patients with CPC who have low tumor TSV and absence of TP53 dysfunction have a
  favorable prognosis and can be successfully treated without radiation therapy.
