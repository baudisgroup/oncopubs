abstract: 'Ovarian cancer is one of the most common types of malignancy in women throughout
  the developed world. Despite recent therapeutic advances, long-term survival is
  poor because ovarian cancer is largely asymptomatic in its early stages. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH was applied to a series of 8 benign, 8 borderline, and
  17 malignant ovarian to establish genomic imbalances associated with tumor progression.
  Benign and borderline tumors were characterized by losses at 1p32 approximately
  p11, 2q14 approximately q34, 4q13 approximately q34, 5q11 approximately q23, and
  6q12 approximately q24, as well as gains of 6p and chromosome 12. Similar chromosomal
  changes were also detected in malignant tumors but included additional chromosomal
  changes: gains at 1q21 approximately q31, 2p, 3q, 5p, 7, 10p, 12p, 16p, 17, 19q,
  20q, and 22q, as well as losses at X, 3p, 8p, 9, 11p, 13, 14, and 18. Some individual
  cases of benign and borderline tumors revealed no genetic alterations detectable
  by CGH, suggesting that these tumors may represent a subset of tumors that originate
  by an alternative mechanism of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, our findings reveal that
  borderline tumors are more similar to benign tumors than to malignant tumors with
  respect to their genetic profiles.'
