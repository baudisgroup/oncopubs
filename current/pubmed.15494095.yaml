abstract: We examined whole genomic aberrations of biopsied samples from 19 independent
  glioblastomas by array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis. The highest
  frequencies of copy number gains were observed on RFC2 73.3 , EGFR 63.2 , and FGR,
  ELN, CDKN1C , FES, TOP2A, and ARSA 57.9 each . The highest frequencies of copy number
  losses were detected on TBR1 52.6 , BMI1 52.6 , EGR2 47.4 , DMBT1 47.4 , MTAP 42.1
  , and FGFR2 42.1 . The copy number gains of CDKN1C and INS and the copy number losses
  of TBR1 were significantly correlated with longer survival of patients. High-level
  amplifications were identified on EGFR, SAS CDK4, PDGFRA, MDM2, and ARSA. These
  genes are assumed to be involved in tumorigenesis or progression of glioblastomas.
  The first attempts to apply detrended fluctuation analysis to copy number profiles
  by considering the reading direction as the time axis demonstrated that higher long-term
  fractal scaling exponents alpha2 correlated well with longer survival of glioblastoma
  patients. The present study indicates that array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis has great potential for assessment of copy number changes and altered chromosomal
  regions of brain tumors. Furthermore, we show that nonlinear analysis methods of
  whole genome copy number profiles may provide prognostic information about glioblastoma
  patients.
