abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is an aggressive, highly proliferative B-cell non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma, characterized by the specific t 11 14 q13 q32 translocation. It is well
  established that this translocation alone is not sufficient to promote MCL development,
  but that additional genetic changes are essential for malignant transformation.
  We have identified such additional tumorigenic triggers in MCL tumors, by applying
  genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization with an 800-kilobase kb
  resolution. This strategy, combined with a newly developed statistical approach,
  enabled us to confirm previously reported genomic alterations such as loss of 1p,
  6q, 11q, 13q and gain of 3q and 8q, but it also facilitated the detection of novel
  recurrent genomic imbalances, such as gain of 4p12-13 and loss of 20p12.1-12.3,
  20q12-13.2, 22q12.1-12.3, and 22q13.31-13.32. Genomic hotspot detection allowed
  for the identification of small genomic intervals that are frequently affected 57
  -93 , resulting in interesting positional candidate genes such as KITLG, GPC5, and
  ING1. Finally, by assessing multiple biopsies from the same patient, we show that
  seemingly stable genomes do show subtle genomic changes over time. The follow-up
  of multiple biopsies of patients with MCL by high-resolution genomic profiling is
  expected to provide us with new clues regarding the relation between clinical outcome
  and in vivo cytogenetic evolution.
