abstract: 'Malignant transformation of endometriosis, an uncommon phenomenon, can
  occur in gonadal and extragonadal sites and results in a wide histological range
  of tumors. Published series reporting malignant transformation of endometriosis
  have largely been confined to clinical and histopathological discussions with no
  studies reporting oncoprotein expression and genetic alterations. We report three
  cases of carcinomas arising in ovarian endometriosis: a serous cystadenocarcinoma,
  an endometrioid carcinoma with squamous differentiation, and a pure squamous cell
  carcinoma. Each tumor was analyzed immunohistochemically to compare oncoprotein
  expression p53, bcl2, cyclin D1, and c-erb B2 between the tumors and the endometriotic
  tissue as well as with comparative genomic hybridization CGH to compare genetic
  alterations. All three tumors expressed nuclear p53, in contrast to the endometriotic
  tissue in which no p53 expression was found. Both endometrial and tumor tissue expressed
  bcl-2. No expression of cyclin D1 or c-erb B2 was detected in endometriotic or tumoral
  tissues. The CGH analysis revealed one or two chromosomal aberrations in each of
  the three tumors with gains on chromosomes 1q, 8q, and 13q, and losses on chromosome
  10p. The endometriotic tissue, as expected, showed a normal genetic profile. These
  results suggest that p53 protein abnormalities and chromosomal aberrations may be
  involved in malignant transformation of endometriosis in the ovary. However, our
  results are limited by the number of cases examined and a definite conclusion on
  the pathogenesis of this process should be followed by future studies with a larger
  number of cases.'
