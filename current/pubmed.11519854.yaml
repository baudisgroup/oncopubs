abstract: Hemangioblastomas HBs of the central nervous system are benign tumors and
  occur as sporadic sp tumors 75 or as a manifestation of the von Hippel-Lindau VHL
  disease 25 . VHL-disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by HBs
  of the central nervous system and retina, renal cell carcinoma RCC , phaeochromocytoma
  PHEO , islet tumors of the pancreas, and endolympatic sac tumors as well as cysts
  and cystadenoma in the kidney, pancreas and epididymis. In VHL patients a large
  spectrum of germline mutations in the VHL gene has been detected. In spHBs VHL alleles
  are reported to be inactivated in up to 50 of the tumors. To our knowledge the involvement
  of other genes in spHBs has not been investigated. To elucidate the oncogenesis
  of spHBs, we performed CGH on 10 spHBs to screen for chromosomal imbalances throughout
  the entire tumor genome. Aberrations most frequently detected are losses of chromosomes
  3 70 , 6 50 , 9 30 , and 18q 30 and a gain of chromosome 19 30 . Based on these
  frequencies and the co-occurrence of these aberrations in the analyzed tumors we
  hypothesize that loss of chromosome 3 harboring the VHL gene is an early event in
  the oncogenesis of spHBs, followed by loss of 6, and then losses of chromosomes
  9, 18q and gain of chromosome 19. Comparison of the chromosomal imbalances in spHBs
  to those previously reported in RCCs and PHEOs reveals that the pathway of spHBs
  shows similarities to both the RCCs and PHEOs.
