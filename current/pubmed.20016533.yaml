abstract: Recent advances in genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP analyses
  have revealed previously unrecognized microdeletions and uniparental disomy UPD
  in a broad spectrum of human cancers. As acute myeloid leukemia AML represents a
  genetically heterogeneous disease, this technology might prove helpful, especially
  for cytogenetically normal AML CN-AML cases. Thus, we performed high-resolution
  SNP analyses in 157 adult cases of CN-AML. Regions of acquired UPDs were identified
  in 12 of cases and in the most frequently affected chromosomes, 6p, 11p and 13q.
  Notably, acquired UPD was invariably associated with mutations in nucleophosmin
  1 NPM1 or CCAAT enhancer binding protein-alpha CEBPA that impair hematopoietic differentiation
  P 0.008 , suggesting that UPDs may preferentially target genes that are essential
  for proliferation and survival of hematopoietic progenitors. Acquired copy number
  alterations CNAs were detected in 49 of cases with losses found in two or more cases
  affecting, for example, chromosome bands 3p13-p14.1 and 12p13. Furthermore, we identified
  two cases with a cryptic t 6 11 as well as several non-recurrent aberrations pointing
  to leukemia-relevant regions. With regard to clinical outcome, there seemed to be
  an association between UPD 11p and UPD 13q cases with overall survival. These data
  show the potential of high-resolution SNP analysis for identifying genomic regions
  of potential pathogenic and clinical relevance in AML.
