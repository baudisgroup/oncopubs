abstract: Basal cell carcinoma is the most common human cancer with increasing incidence
  reported worldwide. Despite the aberrant signaling role of the Hedgehog pathway,
  little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying basal cell carcinomas. Towards
  a better understanding of global genetic events, we have employed the Affymetrix
  Mapping 10K single nucleotide polymorphism SNP microarray technique for amp quot
  fingerprinting amp quot genomewide allelic imbalance in 14 basal cell carcinoma-blood
  pair samples. This rapid high-resolution SNP genotyping technique has revealed a
  somatic recombination event-uniparental disomy, leading to a loss of heterozygosity
  LOH , as a key alternative genetic mechanism to allelic imbalances in basal cell
  carcinomas. A highly conserved LOH region at 9q21-q31 was found in 13 of 14 93 basal
  cell carcinomas. Further statistical and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses
  confirmed that the 9q LOH was a result of uniparental disomy in 5 of 13 38 basal
  cell carcinomas. De novo mutations in the Patched 1 gene PTCH were found in 9 of
  13 69 basal cell carcinomas with 9q LOH. A second important locus, containing LOH
  at 6q23-q27 was found in 5 of 14 36 basal cell carcinomas, suggesting that the presence
  of an additional putative tumor suppressor gene may be contributing to basal cell
  carcinoma development. This study shows that the rate of 9q LOH in basal cell carcinomas
  has been previously underestimated. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that
  uniparental disomy due to somatic recombination constitutes one of the mechanisms
  of LOH in basal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis.
