abstract: Smoothened SMO inhibitors recently entered clinical trials for sonic-hedgehog-driven
  medulloblastoma SHH-MB . Clinical response is highly variable. To understand the
  mechanism s of primary resistance and identify pathways cooperating with aberrant
  SHH signaling, we sequenced and profiled a large cohort of SHH-MBs n 133 . SHH pathway
  mutations involved PTCH1 across all age groups , SUFU infants, including germline
  , and SMO adults . Children 3 years old harbored an excess of downstream MYCN and
  GLI2 amplifications and frequent TP53 mutations, often in the germline, all of which
  were rare in infants and adults. Functional assays in different SHH-MB xenograft
  models demonstrated that SHH-MBs harboring a PTCH1 mutation were responsive to SMO
  inhibition, whereas tumors harboring an SUFU mutation or MYCN amplification were
  primarily resistant.
