abstract: Established cancer cell lines are useful in the study of various cancers.
  We established a human gastric carcinoma cell line TMC-1 derived from the lymph
  node of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. TMC-1 cells grew
  in vitro as a mixture of attached and suspension cells, and exhibited spindle or
  ovoid morphology. They had a population doubling time of 15 h, a plating efficiency
  of 61 , formed colonies in semisolid agar, secreted the tumor marker CA 19-9, and
  were tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. The cells expressed E-cadherin and beta-catenin.
  The karyotypic analysis demonstrated hyperdiploid features with a modal chromosome
  of 53. The cell had the deletion at chromosome 18q and gains at chromosome 2p13-25,
  5p15, 5q21-35, 7, 8q24, 9q, 11, 12p, 14q24-32 and 20. Analysis by fluorescence in
  situ hybridization showed the deletion at 7qtel and duplication at 7q11.2 at the
  rearranged chromosome 7. Growth of TMC-1 cells was inhibited by 27-32 by interferon-alpha
  2,000 U ml and by interferon-gamma with an IC50 of 125 U ml. The cell line is tumorigenic
  in vivo, and its growth is moderately inhibited by interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma.
  It can be used to develop new modalities of human gastric cancer treatment.
