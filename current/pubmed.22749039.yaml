abstract: Acute promyelocytic leukemia APL is characterized by the generation of the
  PML-RAR fusion transcript as a result of a reciprocal chromosomal rearrangement,
  t 15 17 q22 q12 , with breakpoints within the PML gene and the RAR gene. In a small
  proportion of APL cases, RAR is fused with a number of alternative partner genes.
  The signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 beta STAT5b is one of the
  variant partners. Here, we describe one rare case with all-trans retinoic acid ATRA
  -unresponsive APL characterized by the STAT5b-RAR fusion transcript. Morphology
  and immunophenotypic analyses indicated the typical features of APL however, cytogenetic
  analysis exhibited a normal karyotype, and importantly, results of interphase fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR
  analysis indicated that PML-RAR expression was negative. FISH analysis with the
  RAR dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe indicated a submicroscopic deletion
  of the 3 end of one RARA gene. Indeed, the STAT5b-RAR fusion transcript was found
  in this case by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and nested RT-PCR.
  To the best of our knowledge, we report here only the sixth APL patient in the world
  with the STAT5b-RAR fusion transcript. Additional clinical studies concerning the
  prognosis, response to therapy, and pathogenesis of APL patients with STAT5b-RAR
  fusion are necessary.
