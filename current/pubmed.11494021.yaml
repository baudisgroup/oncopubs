abstract: Small cell lung cancer SCLC is a frequently occurring, highly aggressive
  tumor with a generally poor clinical outcome. In order to approach the genetic mechanisms
  behind the tumor progression, a general screen for DNA copy number alterations was
  performed using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . In the series of 23 cases
  analyzed, CGH alterations were frequently detected ranging from 9 to 22 abnormalities
  in the individual tumors. The most frequent losses were detected on chromosome arms
  3p 23 23 , 13q14-21 23 23 , 4p 20 23 , 4q 20 23 , and 2q22-24 18 23 , while gains
  preferentially involved chromosome arms 19p 18 23 , 19q 17 23 , 1p31-35 15 23 ,
  17q22-25 11 23 , and 5p14-15.3 9 23 . In addition, high level amplification at chromosome
  arms 1p32-33 and 2p22-24 were found in three and two cases, respectively. Candidate
  genes for these amplifications include the l-MYC 1p32 and n-MYC 2p24.1 oncogenes,
  which have been previously found to be overexpressed in SCLC. Taken together, the
  findings demonstrate a high level of chromosomal instability in SCLC, which is well
  in agreement with the highly malignant phenotype of this tumor type. Subchromosomal
  regions involved in gains and losses were delineated and the amplifications of 1p32-33
  and 2p22-24 were demonstrated, thus providing starting points for the exact characterization
  of molecular events involved in SCLC tumor progression.
