abstract: Constitutive NF-kappaB activation has causative roles in adult T cell leukemia
  ATL caused by HTLV-1 and other cancers. Here, we report a pathway involving Polycomb-mediated
  miRNA silencing and NF-kappaB activation. We determine the miRNA signatures and
  reveal miR-31 loss in primary ATL cells. MiR-31 negatively regulates the noncanonical
  NF-kappaB pathway by targeting NF-kappaB inducing kinase NIK . Loss of miR-31 therefore
  triggers oncogenic signaling. In ATL cells, miR-31 level is epigenetically regulated,
  and aberrant upregulation of Polycomb proteins contribute to miR-31 downregulation
  in an epigenetic fashion, leading to activation of NF-kappaB and apoptosis resistance.
  Furthermore, this emerging circuit operates in other cancers and receptor-initiated
  NF-kappaB cascade. Our findings provide a perspective involving the epigenetic program,
  inflammatory responses, and oncogenic signaling.
