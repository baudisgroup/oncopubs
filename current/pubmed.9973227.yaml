abstract: 'Incidence rates have risen rapidly for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.
  These cancers, arising at and around the gastroesophageal junction GEJ , share a
  poor prognosis. In contrast, there is no consensus with respect to clinical staging
  resulting in possible adverse effects on treatment and survival. The goal of this
  study was to provide more insight into the genetic changes underlying esophageal
  and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas. We have used comparative genomic hybridization
  for a genetic analysis of 28 adenocarcinomas of the GEJ. Eleven tumors were localized
  in the distal esophagus and related to Barretts esophagus, and 10 tumors were situated
  in the gastric cardia. The remaining seven tumors were located at the junction and
  could not be classified as either Barrett-related, or gastric cardia. We found alterations
  in all 28 neoplasms. Gains and losses were distinguished in comparable numbers.
  Frequent loss amp gt or 25 of all tumors was detected, in decreasing order of frequency,
  on 4pq 54 , 14q 46 , 18q 43 , 5q 36 , 16q 36 , 9p 29 , 17p 29 , and 21q 29 . Frequent
  gain amp gt or 25 of all tumors was observed, in decreasing order of frequency,
  on 20pq 86 , 8q 79 , 7p 61 , 13q 46 , 12q 39 , 15q 39 , 1q 36 , 3q 32 , 5p 32 ,
  6p 32 , 19q 32 , Xpq 32 , 17q 29 , and 18p 25 . Nearly all patients were male, and
  loss of chromosome Y was frequently noted 64 . Recurrent high-level amplifications
  amp gt 10 of all tumors were seen at 8q23-24.1, 15q25, 17q12-21, and 19q13.1. Minimal
  overlapping regions could be determined at multiple locations candidate genes are
  in parentheses : minimal regions of overlap for deletions were assigned to 3p14
  FHIT, RCA1 , 5q14-21 APC, MCC , 9p21 MTS1 CDKN2 , 14q31-32.1 TSHR , 16q23, 18q21
  DCC, P15 and 21q21. Minimal overlapping amplified sites could be seen at 5p14 MLVI2
  , 6p12-21.1 NRASL3 , 7p12 EGFR , 8q23-24.1 MYC , 12q21.1, 15q25 IGF1R , 17q12-21
  ERBB2 HER2-neu , 19q13.1 TGFB1, BCL3, AKT2 , 20p12 PCNA , 20q12-13 MYBL2, PTPN1
  , and Xq25. The distribution of the imbalances revealed similar genetic patterns
  in the three GEJ tumor groups. However, loss of 14q31-32.1 occurred significantly
  more frequent in Barrett-related adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus, than in
  gastric cardia cancers P 0.02 . The unclassified, amp quot pure junction amp quot
  group displayed an intermediate position, suggesting that these may be in part gastric
  cardia tumors, whereas the others may be related to short-segment Barretts esophagus.
  In conclusion, this study has, fist, provided a detailed comparative genomic hybridization-map
  of GEJ adenocarcinomas documenting new genetic changes, as well as candidate genes
  involved. Second, genetic divergence was revealed in this poorly understood group
  of cancers.'
