abstract: To identify critical tumor suppressor loci that are associated with the
  development of medulloblastoma, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide allelotype
  analysis in a series of 12 medulloblastomas. Non-random allelic imbalances were
  identified on chromosomes 7q 58.3 , 8p 66.7 , 16q 58.3 , 17p 58.3 and 17q 66.7 .
  Comparative genomic hybridization analysis confirmed that allelic imbalances on
  8p, 16q and 17p were due to loss of genetic materials. Finer deletion mapping in
  an expanded series of 23 medulloblastomas localized the common deletion region on
  8p to an interval of 18.14 cM on 8p22-23.2. We then searched within the region of
  loss on 8p for loci that might contain homozygous deletion using comparative duplex
  PCR. An overlapping homozygous deletion region was identified in a 1.8 cM interval
  on 8p22-23.1, between markers D8S520 and D8S1130, in two medulloblastomas. This
  region of homozygous deletion also encompasses the 1.4 cM minimal deletion region
  detected on 8p in ductal carcinoma in situ of breast. In conclusion, we reported
  for the first time a detailed deletion mapping on 8p in medulloblastoma and have
  identified a region of homozygous deletion on 8p22-23.1 that is likely to contain
  a critical tumor suppressor gene involved in the development of medulloblastoma.
