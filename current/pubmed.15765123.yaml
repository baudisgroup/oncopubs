abstract: Administration of doxorubicin has been shown to prolong survival of patients
  with hepatocellular carcinoma HCC . However, treatment regimen is often complicated
  by the emergence of drug resistance. The goal of our study is to enhance our understanding
  on the genetic changes that confer cellular chemoresistance to doxorubicin. To model
  this insensitive response, we established five doxorubicin-resistant DOR sublines
  through repeated exposure of escalating doses of doxorubicin to HCC cell lines HKCI-2,
  -3, -4, -C1 and -C2 . The DOR sublines developed displayed an average approximately
  17-fold higher IC 50 value than their sensitive parental cell lines. The resistant
  phenotype displayed was investigated by the genome-wide analyses of comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and complementary DNA microarray for the affected genomic
  anomalies and deregulated genes expressed, respectively. Over-representations of
  regional chr. 7q11-q21, 8q22-q23 and 10p13-pter were indicated in the DOR sublines
  from CGH analysis. Of particular interest was the finding of amplicon augmentations
  from regional or whole chromosome gains during the clonal expansion of resistant
  sublines. Most notably, recurring amplicon 7q11.2-q21 identified coincided with
  the location of the multi-drug-resistant gene, MDR1. The potential involvement of
  MDR1 was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
  RT-PCR qRT-PCR , which indicated an upregulation in all DOR sublines P 0.015 . Consistent
  overexpression of the translated MDR1 gene, P-glycoprotein, in all five DOR sublines
  was further confirmed in Western blot analysis. Two distinct cluster dendrograms
  were achieved between the DOR sublines and their sensitive parental counterparts
  in expression profiling. Within the doxorubicin-resistant group, distinct features
  of candidate genes overexpressions including ABC transporting proteins, solute carriers
  and TOP2A were suggested. Further assessment of TOP2A messenger RNA levels by qRT-PCR
  confirmed array findings and pinpointed to a common up-regulation of TOP2A in DOR
  sublines. Our present study highlighted areas of genomic imbalances and candidate
  genes in the acquired doxorubicin-resistance behavior of HCC cells.
