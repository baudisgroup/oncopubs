abstract: Little is known about the molecular cytogenetic changes in cholangiocarcinoma
  and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, and on the prognostic significance
  of chromosomal imbalances in hepatocellular carcinoma. Seventy-eight cases of primary
  liver cancer with available median follow-up of 16.5 months, including 49 hepatocellular
  carcinomas, 22 cholangiocarcinomas, and 7 combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas,
  were examined by comparative genomic hybridization. In hepatocellular carcinoma,
  the most frequent changes were 8q 54 , -8p 54 , and 1q 42 , followed by -6q 35 ,
  -4q 33 , -13q 29 , -14q 25 , -16q 19 , -17p 19 , 17q 17 , and 20q 15 . In comparison,
  cholangiocarcinoma had more gains, losses, and breakpoints than hepatocellular carcinoma
  or combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, specifically more frequently -6q
  91 , -3p 68 , -9p 55 , -14q 55 , -13q 45 , 1q 41 , 7q 36 , 7p 32 , and 8q 32 . Combined
  losses at 6q and 3p appeared to be highly characteristic for cholangiocarcinoma.
  In contrast, combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma shared frequent 1q 71 ,
  8q 57 , and -8p 57 with hepatocellular carcinoma, but a tendency for higher numbers
  of imbalances with cholangiocarcinoma. Overall, higher numbers of changes, breakpoints,
  or gains appeared to carry unfavorable prognostic value among hepatocellular carcinomas,
  with higher numbers of gains retaining prognostic value among R0-resected hepatocellular
  carcinomas. Cholangiocarcinoma is characterized by combined losses at 6q and 3p
  and a tendency for chromosomal instability. On the other hand, combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma
  may share similar chromosomal changes with both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma,
  as reflected by common hepatocellular carcinoma-like 8q, 1q, and -8p and a tendency
  for cholangiocarcinoma-like chromosomal instability. In hepatocellular carcinoma,
  higher number of gains may prove an adverse prognostic parameter.
