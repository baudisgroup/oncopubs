abstract: We applied whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define
  a comprehensive genetic profile of 23 esophageal adenocarcinoma EAC primary tumor
  biopsies based on loss of heterozygosity LOH and DNA copy number changes. Alterations
  were common, averaging 97 range, 23-208 per tumor. LOH and gains averaged 33 range,
  3-83 and 31 range, 11-73 per tumor, respectively. Copy neutral LOH events averaged
  27 range, 7-57 per EAC. We noted 126 homozygous deletions HD across the EAC panel
  range, 0-11 in individual tumors . Frequent HDs within FHIT 17 of 23 , WWOX 8 of
  23 , and DMD 6 of 23 suggest a role for common fragile sites or genomic instability
  in EAC etiology. HDs were also noted for known tumor suppressor genes TSG , including
  CDKN2A, CDKN2B, SMAD4, and GALR1, and identified PDE4D and MGC48628 as potentially
  novel TSGs. All tumors showed LOH for most of chromosome 17p, suggesting that TSGs
  other than TP53 may be targeted. Frequent gains were noted around MYC 13 of 23 ,
  BCL9 12 of 23 , CTAGE1 14 of 23 , and ZNF217 12 of 23 . Thus, we have confirmed
  previous reports indicating frequent changes to FHIT, CDKN2A, TP53, and MYC in EAC
  and identified additional genes of interest. Meta-analysis of previous genome-wide
  EAC studies together with the data presented here highlighted consistent regions
  of gain on 8q, 18q, and 20q and multiple LOH regions on 4q, 5q, 17p, and 18q, suggesting
  that more than one gene may be targeted on each of these chromosome arms. The focal
  gains and deletions documented here are a step toward identifying the key genes
  involved in EAC development.
