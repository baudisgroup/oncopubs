abstract: We have analyzed 18 low-grade gliomas using array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH with an average resolution of amp lt 500 kb. Because the majority of these
  tumors showed loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, we used custom statistical approaches
  to define submegabase hemizygous losses throughout the genome that correlated with
  19q loss. As a result of this analysis, we have identified a approximately 550-kb
  region in 11q13 and a approximately 300-kb region in 13q12 that showed hemizygous
  deletion in virtually all the tumors analyzed regardless of their 1p 19q status.
  FISH analyses of interphase nuclei from the same tumors used for aCGH analysis confirmed
  the hemizygous loss. The identification of such specific changes provides a potentially
  very useful diagnostic marker for this subgroup of low-grade tumors. These regions
  of the genome define small numbers of candidate genes that are within the deletions.
  The aCGH analysis also defined the spectrum of gain and loss of genomic regions
  in low-grade oligodendrogliomas.
