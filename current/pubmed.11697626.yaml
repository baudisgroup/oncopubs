abstract: We investigated the frequency of bcl-2 protein overexpression in 80 diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL patients using both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry
  IHC . Fifty-nine percent of the DLBCLs overexpressed bcl-2 protein by Western blot
  and 52 by IHC. The two methods usually gave concordant results p 0.005 , but 14
  21 out of the 67 cases that were analyzed by both methods were positive by Western
  blot and negative by IHC, and 8 12 cases vice versa. Bcl-2 overexpression by IHC
  was associated with poor response to chemotherapy and poor survival, whereas these
  associations were not found when bcl-2 overexpression was determined by Western
  blotting. The molecular mechanisms leading to bcl-2 overexpression were evaluated
  by PCR, karyotype analysis, and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . When studied
  by PCR and or karyotype analysis, 12 15 of the 80 cases had translocation 14 18
  q32 q21 . All 12 lymphomas with 14 18 q32 q21 translocation had bcl-2 overexpression
  by Western blot as compared with 35 51 of the 68 lymphomas without translocation
  p 0.001 . Ten 29 out of 34 cases that were analyzed by CGH showed amplification
  of chromosome 18 in which the BCL2 gene is located, and all cases showed bcl-2 overexpression
  by both Western blot and IHC. The results suggest that gene amplification and translocation
  are at least equally common mechanisms causing bcl-2 protein overexpression in DLBCL.
  Bcl-2 protein overexpression as determined by IHC is associated with poor response
  to chemotherapy and poor survival.
