abstract: Of the genetic changes in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL),
  little is known. To detect copy number alterations and differentially expressed
  genes in PCNSL, we analyzed a total of 12 PCNSL samples with high-resolution array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization and performed expression profiling in 7 of the
  12 samples. The most frequent deletion found in 8 patients (66.7%) occurred in 9p21.3
  containing CDKN2A. We compiled the top 96 genes (family-wise error rate, P < .05)
  showing the greatest differential expression between PCNSL and normal lymph node
  tissues. From these, we selected 8 candidate genes (NPFFR2, C4orf7, OSMR, EMCN,
  TPO, FNDC1, COL12A1, and MSC) in which expression changes were associated with copy
  number aberrations. All 8 genes showed both down-regulation in expression microarray
  and deletion in array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses. These genes
  participate in cell signaling or cell adhesion. In addition, low mRNA expression
  of C4orf7 was significantly associated with poor survival (P = .0425). Using gene
  set enrichment analysis, we identified several signal transduction pathways, such
  as Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway and adhesion-related
  pathways, which may be involved in pathogenesis of PCNSL. In conclusion, this study
  identified novel tumor suppressor genes that may serve as therapeutic targets of
  PCNSL.
