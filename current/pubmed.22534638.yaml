abstract: We report a new case of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm BPDCN
  with extensive immunophenoptyping, genotyping karyotype, array-comparative genomic
  hybridization, and fluorescent in situ hybridization , and long-term tumor cells
  culture. BPDCN is a very rare and aggressive disease clinically characterized by
  a skin revealing localization more or less rapidly disseminating to the bone marrow
  and other organs with or without and leukemia. The disease was initially phenotypically
  characterized by the expression of both CD4 and CD56 antigens, whereas lymphoid
  and myeloid lineage antigens were negative. A phenotypic link with alpha-interferon
  IFN-I -producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells was demonstrated. The data collected
  in this case report provide additional biological and genotypical data on tumor
  cells of BPDCN. This study confirms the capability of tumor cells to secrete IFN-I,
  demonstrated by biological IFN-I activity of cultured cells and immunohistochemical
  expression of Mx-1 protein. Although a common genetic profile involving chromosomes
  5, 6, 9, 12, 13, and 15 has been identified, no specific genetic marker has been
  demonstrated that is specific to BPDCN. The demonstration of ETV6 gene deletion
  in this case deserves further investigations as a putative BPDCN marker.
