abstract: Anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC is one of the malignant tumors with the poor
  prognosis that is thought to arise from well-differentiated thyroid cancer DTC .
  To investigate the molecular mechanism of ATC, we studied genomic alterations of
  eight ATC cell lines and three DTC cell lines by means of the comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH method. Loss of 16p was observed in five of eight ATC cell lines
  62. 5 , but none of the three DTC cell lines showed loss of this chromosome arm.
  It is notable that loss of 18q 7 8 of ATC 87.5 , 2 3 of DTC 67 and gain of 20q 5
  8 of ATC 62.5 , 3 3 of DTC 100 were frequently seen in both histologic types. Our
  results suggest that there is a gene in 16p that is closely associated with transformation
  from well-differentiated thyroid cancer to anaplastic cancer.
