abstract: 'The incidence of adenocarcinoma in Barretts esophagus has been increasing
  rapidly over the past decades. Neoplastic progression is characterized by three
  well-defined premalignant stages: metaplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade
  dysplasia. A genome-wide overview, based on comparative genomic hybridization, was
  performed, evaluating 30 Barretts adenocarcinomas and 25 adjacent precursors, i.e.,
  6 metaplasias, 9 low-grade dysplasias, and 10 high-grade dysplasias. The frequency
  of losses and gains significantly increased in the subsequent stages of malignant
  transformation. Losses of 5q21-q23, 9p21, 17p12-13.1, 18q21, and Y were revealed
  in low-grade dysplasias. This was followed by loss of 7q33-q35 and gains of 7p12-p15,
  7q21-q22, and 17q21 in high-grade dysplasias along with high-level amplification
  HLA of 7q21 and 17q21. In the invasive cancers, additional losses of 3p14-p21, 4p,
  4q, 8p21, 13q14-q31, 14q24.3-q31, 16q21-q22, and 22q as well as gains of 3q25-q27,
  8q23-24.1, 12p11.2-12, 15q22-q24, and 20q11.2-q13.1 were distinguished along with
  HLAs of 8p12-p22 and 20q11.2-q13.1. Approximately one-third of the alterations in
  the dysplasias were also found in the adjacent adenocarcinomas, illustrating that
  multiple clonal lineages can be present in Barretts esophagus. Novel findings include
  loss on 7q, gain on 12p, and the observation of several HLAs in high-grade dysplasias.
  Furthermore, loss of 7q33-q35 was found to represent a significant distinction between
  low-grade and high-grade dysplasia P 0.01 , whereas loss of 16q21-q22 and gain of
  20q11.2-q13.1 were disclosed to significantly discriminate between high-grade dysplasia
  and adenocarcinoma P 0.02 and P 0.03, respectively . This inventory of genetic aberrations
  increases our understanding of malignant transformation in Barretts esophagus and
  might provide useful biomarkers for disease progression.'
