abstract: Cytogenetically unrelated clones have been detected by chromosome banding
  analysis in many breast carcinomas. Because these karyotypic studies were performed
  on short-term cultured samples, it may be argued that in vitro selection occurred
  or that small clones may have arisen during culturing. To address this issue, we
  analyzed 37 breast carcinomas by G-banding and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , a fluorescent in situ hybridization--based screening technique that does not
  require culturing or tumor metaphases. All but two of the 37 karyotypically abnormal
  cases presented copy number changes by CGH. The picture of genomic alterations revealed
  by the two techniques overlapped only partly. Sometimes the CGH analysis revealed
  genomic imbalances that belonged to cell populations not picked up by the cytogenetic
  analysis and in other cases, especially when the karyotypes had many markers and
  chromosomes with additional material of unknown origin, CGH gave a more reliable
  overall picture of the copy number gains and losses. However, besides sometimes
  revealing cell populations with balanced chromosome aberrations or unbalanced changes
  that nevertheless remained undetected by CGH, G-banding analysis was essential to
  understand how the genomic imbalances arose in the many cases in which both techniques
  detected the same clonal abnormalities. Furthermore, because CGH pictures only imbalances
  present in a significant proportion of the test sample, the very detection by this
  technique of imbalances belonging to apparently small, cytogenetically unrelated
  clones of cells proves that these clones must have been present in vivo. This constitutes
  compelling evidence that the cytogenetic polyclonality observed after short-term
  culturing of breast carcinomas is not an artifact.
