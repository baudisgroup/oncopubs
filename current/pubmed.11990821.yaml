abstract: Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system CNS may occur sporadically
  or in association with von Hippel-Lindau VHL syndrome. The authors present four
  patients with no family history or clinical evidence of VHL syndrome in whom extensive,
  progressive, en plaque coating of the brainstem and spinal cord with hemangioblastomas
  developed 1 to 8 years after complete resection of a solitary cerebellar hemangioblastoma.
  Analysis included detailed physical, biochemical, radiological, and pathological
  examinations in all four patients, combined with family pedigree analysis. In addition,
  a detailed investigation of the VHL gene was undertaken. Allelic loss, comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , single-stranded conformational polymorphism screening,
  CpG island methylation status, and X chromosome inactivation clonality analyses
  were performed. Although there was no evidence of germline alterations in the VHL
  gene on clinical and radiological examination or in the family history all four
  patients or analysis of peripheral blood three patients , somatic deletion of one
  copy of the VHL gene occurred in these tumors. These findings indicate that the
  multiple, separate deposits of tumors were likely derived from a single clone. Results
  of CGH indicate that one or several additional genes are probably involved in the
  malignant behavior of the hemangioblastomas in these patients. Furthermore, the
  malignant biological and clinical behavior of these tumors, in which multiple sites
  of subarachnoid dissemination developed 1 to 8 years after initial complete resection,
  followed by progressive tumor growth and death of the patients, occurred despite
  a histological appearance typical of benign hemangioblastomas. Malignant hemangioblastomatosis
  developed 1 to 8 years after resection of an isolated cerebellar hemangioblastoma.
  Alterations of the VHL gene may be permissive in this setting, but other genes are
  likely to be the source of the novel biological and clinical presentation of the
  disseminated hemangioblastomas in these patients. This appears to represent a novel
  condition in which the product of one or more mutations in several genes permits
  malignant tumor behavior despite retention of a benign histological picture, a circumstance
  previously not recognized in CNS tumors.
