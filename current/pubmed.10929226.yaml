abstract: In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas HNSCC
  , established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.
  For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization
  CGH to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.
  Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until
  death. During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer
  disease. The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single
  chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter. The curves
  were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the Breslow test. Significance
  of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.
  The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly
  lower in patients whos tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13
  p 0.0008 for LR and p 0.0024 for B . The survival time of the patients was also
  lower if the carcinomas carried over-representations of chromosome 3q p 0.0299 for
  LR and p 0.0546 for B . Multivariate analysis Coxs proportional hazards model revealed
  both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC. None
  of the conventional clinicopathological parameters pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading
  achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model. These results suggest
  that in HNSCC the occurrence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are
  highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established
  TNM and grading criteria.
