abstract: Few studies have been conducted to investigate the genomic survey of oncogene
  amplification in medulloblastoma. Low frequency of N-myc, C-myc, and epidermal grow
  factor receptor EGFR gene amplification amp lt 10 has been reported in medulloblastoma.
  Previous comparative genomic hybridization CGH study of primary medulloblastomas
  has revealed chromosomal amplification on 2p21, 3p, 5p15.3, 7q, 8q24, 11q22.3, and
  17q. The aim of this study was to detect common oncogenes involved in medulloblastoma
  tumorigenesis.
