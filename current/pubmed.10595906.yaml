abstract: The molecular pathogenesis as well as histogenesis of endocrine pancreatic
  tumors EPTs is not well understood, and the clinical behavior of EPTs is difficult
  to predict using current morphological criteria. Thus, more accurate markers of
  risk and better understanding of tumor initiation and progression are needed to
  allow a precise classification of EPTs. We have studied 44 benign and malignant
  EPTs by comparative genomic hybridization to correlate the overall number of genetic
  alterations with clinical and histopathological parameters and to identify chromosomal
  regions which might harbor genes involved in EPT pathogenesis and progression. Aberrations
  were found in 36 EPTs, and chromosomal losses mean, 5.3 were slightly more frequent
  than gains mean, 4. 6 . The most frequent losses involved Y 45 of male EPTs , 6q
  39 , 11q 36 , 3p, 3q, 11p each 30 , 6p 27 , and 10q and Xq each 25 , whereas most
  common gains included 7q 43 , 17q 41 , 5q and 14q each 32 , 7p, 9q, 17p, 20q each
  27 , and 12q and Xp each 25 . A correlation was found between the total number of
  genetic changes per tumor and both tumor size and disease stage. In particular,
  losses of 3p and 6 and gains of 14q and Xq were found to be associated with metastatic
  disease. Furthermore, characteristic patterns of genetic changes were found in the
  various EPT subtypes, eg, 6q loss in malignant insulinomas, indicating that these
  groups might evolve along genetically different pathways. The highlighted genetic
  aberrations, including the newly found involvement of 6q losses and sex chromosome
  alterations, should stimulate the further analysis of these chromosomal regions,
  which may lead to the discovery of novel genes important in the tumorigenesis and
  evolution of EPTs.
