abstract: 'Hepatoblastoma HB is the most common liver tumor in childhood and differs
  in its environmental risk factors and genetic background from hepatocellular carcinoma.
  HB is associated with inherited conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis
  and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, suggesting the importance of genetic abnormalities
  in the pathogenesis and progression of this disease. It has a very polymorphous
  morphology. A diverse range of cytogenetic alterations has been reported to date,
  the most frequent being trisomy 2 and trisomy 20. Thirty-five HB specimens from
  31 patients 22 purely epithelial, 4 purely mesenchymal, 9 mixed were examined by
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH , a technique that enables us to screen the
  entire tumor genome for genetic losses and gains. Our aims were as follows: 1 to
  characterize chromosome abnormalities that appear in this tumor and 2 to identify
  possible differences between different histologic subtypes of HB. We found significant
  gains of genetic material, with very little difference in the number and type of
  alterations between the different histologic components of HB. The most frequent
  alterations were gains of Xp 15 cases, 43 and Xq 21 cases, 60 . This finding was
  also confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on nuclei extracted
  from 6 specimens. Other common alterations were 1p-, 2q , 2q-, 4q-, and 4q . We
  found no difference between different histologic subtypes, a finding that may be
  in agreement with the hypothesis of a common clonal origin for the different components.
  An hitherto-unreported high frequency of X chromosome gains may support the assumption
  that X-linked genes are involved in the development of this neoplasm.'
