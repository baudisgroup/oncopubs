abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to study genomic imbalances
  in 77 squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck HNSCC and in four cell lines
  derived from oral carcinomas. Particular attention was paid to all tumors characterized
  by a gain of two specific chromosomal segments, i.e. 3q26-qter and 5p14-p15. The
  57 tumors containing both or one of the two imbalances were compared with 20 tumors
  lacking both with regard to genomic complexity, as well as to associated genomic,
  histopathologic and clinical peculiarities. 60 of the oral, and 66 of the non-oral
  cancers exhibited a gain of 3q26-qter, while a gain of 5p14-p15 was found in 66
  of the oral, but only in 48 of the non-oral tumors. 48 of all tumors were characterized
  by both gains together, 26 exhibited only one of the two alterations. It could be
  shown that presence of both, gain of 3q26-qter and 5p14-p15, was clearly associated
  with a significantly higher complexity of genomic changes which was not only expressed
  as a high frequency of DNA copy number alterations CNAs but was also connected with
  a considerable number of additional amplifications of various chromosomal segments
  and a high conformity of the patterns of genomic imbalances in these tumors. Clear
  differences of the extent and of the patterns of genomic imbalance could be observed
  between oral and non-oral tumors. With respect to histopathological parameters,
  no clear association could be found for specific imbalances to the grade of differentiation,
  nor the invasiveness or metastatic status of the tumors. However, a higher number
  of patients with tumors characterized by gain of 3q26-qter plus 5p14-p15 died within
  a short period i.e. less than 15 months after excision of the tumor compared to
  the group without these imbalances. The implications of these findings are discussed
  from the oncogenetic and clinical aspects and in comparison with other reports.
