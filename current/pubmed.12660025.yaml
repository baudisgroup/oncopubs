abstract: Grade II astrocytoma is defined as a low-grade tumor, yet patients have
  a wide range of survival and tumors can quickly progress to high-grade astrocytoma
  glioblastoma. Previous studies using comparative genomic hybridization CGH failed
  to demonstrate frequent copy number aberrations CNA in these tumors. This may be
  related to technical difficulties because infiltrating astrocytic tumors are often
  intermixed with normal brain tissue. We developed methods to exclude most normal
  tissue and use small amounts of DNA for CGH by microdissecting small regions of
  tumor from paraffin sections and amplifying extracted DNA using degenerate oligonucleotide-primed
  polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR . Using this method, we examined 30 grade II astrocytoma
  cases. We found CNA in 25 cases 83 , with a mean of two CNA per case. The most frequent
  CNA were gains on 7q 12 cases , 5p 5 cases , 9 5 cases , and 19p 3 cases , and losses
  on 19q 7 cases , 1p 6 cases , and Xp 3 cases . Gain on 7q and losses on 1p 19q were
  mutually exclusive. This is the first report on the genetic characterization of
  low-grade astrocytomas using CGH from microdissected and formalin-fixed tissue.
  The comparatively large number of cases in this study allows us to suggest that
  these tumors are genetically subgrouped.
