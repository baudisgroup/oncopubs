abstract: Members of the mammalian phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase PI3K family of proteins
  are critical regulators of various cellular process including cell survival, growth,
  proliferation, and motility. Oncogenic activating mutations in the p110alpha catalytic
  subunit of the heterodimeric p110 p85 PI3K enzyme are frequent in human cancers.
  Here we show the presence of frequent mutations in p85alpha in colon cancer, a majority
  of which occurs in the inter-Src homology-2 iSH2 domain. These mutations uncouple
  and retain p85alphas p110-stabilizing activity, while abrogating its p110-inhibitory
  activity. The p85alpha mutants promote cell survival, AKT activation, anchorage-independent
  cell growth, and oncogenesis in a p110-dependent manner.
