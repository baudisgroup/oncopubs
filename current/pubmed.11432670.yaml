abstract: In a recent study, 23 microdissected areas of 10 glioblastoma multiforme
  GBM were investigated for quantitative genomic aberrations using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . To validate the chromosomal aberrations, as revealed by CGH
  after microdissection, parallel tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically
  with an antibody that detects both wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR
  and the deletion mutant form of the receptor EGFRvIII . Immunostaining was correlated
  with CGH data of chromosome 7, because chromosome 7 is the most frequently aberrant
  chromosome in GBM here four of 10 tumors , and this aberration often indicates an
  abnormality of EGFR. Nine of nine areas that showed gain in or amplification 2 areas
  of chromosome 7 with CGH contained EGFR-immunoreactive cells. Only three of 14 areas
  without abnormality of chromosome 7 in CGH contained EGFR-immunoreactive cells eleven
  of 14 areas were immunonegative. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between
  immunohistochemistry of EGFR and the copy numbers of chromosome 7, as revealed by
  CGH after microdissection in glioblastoma multiforme.
