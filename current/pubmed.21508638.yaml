abstract: Amplification of oncogenes and closely linked flanking genes is common in
  some types of cancer and can be associated with complex chromosome rearrangements
  and or co-amplification of non-syntenic chromosomal regions. To better understand
  the etiology and structural complexity of focal MYCN amplicons in human neuronal
  cancer, we investigated the precise chromosomal locations of high copy number genomic
  regions in MYCN amplified cell lines. An integrated cytogenetic map of the MYCN
  amplicon was created using high-resolution array CGH, spectral karyotyping SKY ,
  multi-color banding mBAND , and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH in 4 human
  neuronal tumor cell lines. The evidence of complex intra- and inter-chromosomal
  events, providing clues concerning the nature of the genomic mechanisms that contributed
  to the process of MYCN amplification, was observed. The presence of multiple co-amplified
  syntenic or non-syntenic sequences in the MYCN amplicon is quite intriguing. MYCN
  is usually centrally located in the amplicon however, the structure and complexity
  of the amplicons were highly variable. It is noteworthy that clusters of unstable
  repetitive regions characterized by CNV sequences were present throughout the regions
  encompassed by MYCN gene amplification, and these sequences could provide a mechanism
  to destabilize this region of the genome. Complex structural rearrangements involving
  genomic losses and gains in the 2p24 region lead to MYCN amplification and that
  these rearrangements can trigger amplification events.
