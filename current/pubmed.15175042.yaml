abstract: The diagnostic and prognostic importance of recurrent chromosomal aberrations
  in systemic B cell lymphoma is well documented. In contrast, limited data exist
  on genetic changes in primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma. In this study we investigated
  chromosomal aberration patterns in two types of primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma
  with a different clinical behavior. Twenty-two primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas,
  including nine follicle center cell lymphomas and 13 large B cell lymphomas of the
  leg, were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization and in part by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. The most frequent imbalances detectable were gains in 18q
  eight of 22 , 1q six of 22 , 7 six of 22 , 12q six of 22 , or Xp four of 22 , and
  losses in 6q four of 22 . In contrast to large B cell lymphomas of the leg, primary
  cutaneous follicle center cell lymphomas had fewer imbalances and lacked translocations
  affecting the IGH locus. Gains in 18q eight of 13 and losses in 6q four of 13 as
  well as breakpoints within the IGH locus six of 11 were restricted to the large
  B cell lymphomas of the leg subtype. Translocation t 14 18 was excluded in 16 primary
  cutaneous B cell lymphomas of both subtypes that were studied by fluorescence in
  situ hybridization. These results suggest that primary cutaneous follicle center
  cell lymphoma and large B cell lymphoma of the leg are characterized by different
  chromosomal aberration patterns, which in part might determine the different clinical
  course of these malignancies.
