abstract: 'The prognosis of renal cell carcinoma RCC varies dependent on histologic
  tumor subtypes. However, differentiation between RCC types may sometimes be difficult
  on histologic grounds alone. Furthermore, the prognostic value of histologic parameters
  for the individual prognosis is limited. Additional information on the molecular
  level seems necessary to obtain more certainty in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation.
  By investigating genetic alterations in different RCC subtypes, we sought to obtain
  a genotype-phenotype correlation. Eighty-two clear-cell, 53 papillary, 23 chromophobe
  RCCs and 26 renal oncocytomas were investigated. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH was performed on DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue samples. DNA was isolated
  from tumor areas by microdissection and amplified by degenerated oligonucleotide
  primed polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR . CGH was performed according to standard
  protocols. We were able to detect specific alterations in each RCC subtype: clear
  cell RCC showed -3p, 5 5q, -8p, -9, -14, -18 papillary chromophilic RCC gains of
  chromosomes 7, 17, 16, 3, 12 chromophobe RCC loss of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13,
  17, 21 renal oncocytomas loss of chromosomes 1 1p and 14. Furthermore, for clear
  cell RCC, it was possible to define alterations which are associated with metastatic
  disease: loss of 9, 10, 14. Our results demonstrate that each RCC subtype is characterized
  by distinct genetic alterations. The definition of genetic alterations seems helpful
  for a tumor typing especially when morphology is equivocal. Therefore, genetic analyses
  represent a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for RCC.'
