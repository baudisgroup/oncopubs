abstract: Most primary intracranial tumors occur as solitary lesions multiple locations
  of one tumor, the occurrence of two different tumors or even collision tumors have
  been described only in a few patients. From a statistical point of view, in less
  than 100 glioblastoma cases will a meningioma be simultaneously present in the brain.
  We report three cases with this coincidence and display the results of CGH and chromosome
  analysis in two patients, in whom the tumors arose in very close spatial correlation
  to each other.
