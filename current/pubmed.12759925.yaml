abstract: Cytogenetic studies of patients with therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia
  t-AML have demonstrated whole chromosome loss or q-arm deletion of chromosomes 5
  and or 7 in a majority of cases. We have established two cell lines, SAML-1 and
  SAML-2, from two patients who developed t-AML after radiation and chemotherapy for
  Hodgkin disease. In both cases, the leukemia cells contained 5q deletions. SAML-1
  has 58 chromosomes and numerous abnormalities, including der 1 1qter-- amp gt 1p22::5q31--
  amp gt 5qter , der 5 5pter-- amp gt 5q22::1p22-- amp gt 1pter , 8, der 13 i 13 q10
  del 13 q11q14.1 , and t 10 11 . Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH with unique
  sequence probes for the 5q31 region showed loss of IL4, IL5, IRF1, and IL3, and
  translocation of IL9, DS5S89, EGR1, and CSFIR to 1p. SAML-2 has 45 chromosomes,
  del 5 q11.2q31 with a t 12 13 ins 12 5 , leading to the proximity of IRF1 and RB1,
  and complex translocations of chromosomes 8 and 11, resulting in amplification of
  MYC and MLL. Comparative genomic hybridization and spectral karyotyping were consistent
  with the G-banding karyotype and FISH analyses. Because a potential tumor suppressor
  s in the 5q31 region has yet to be identified, these cell lines should prove useful
  in the study of the mechanisms leading to the development of t-AML.
