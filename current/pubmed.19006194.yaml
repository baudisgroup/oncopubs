abstract: The genetic basis of MALT lymphoma is largely unknown. Characteristic chromosomal
  translocations are frequently associated with gastric and pulmonary cases, but are
  rare at other sites. We compared the genetic profiles of 33 ocular adnexal and 25
  pulmonary MALT lymphomas by 1 Mb array-comparative genomic hybridization CGH and
  revealed recurrent 6q23 losses and 6p21.2-6p22.1 gains exclusive to ocular cases.
  High-resolution chromosome 6 tile-path array-CGH identified NF-kappaB inhibitor
  A20 as the target of 6q23.3 deletion and TNFA B C locus as a putative target of
  6p21.2-22.1 gain. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that A20
  deletion occurred in MALT lymphoma of the ocular adnexa 8 42 19 , salivary gland
  2 24 8 , thyroid 1 9 11 and liver 1 2 , but not in the lung 26 , stomach 45 and
  skin 13 . Homozygous deletion was observed in three cases. A20 deletion and TNFA
  B C gain were significantly associated p amp lt 0.001 and exclusively found in cases
  without characteristic translocation. In ocular cases, A20 deletion was associated
  with concurrent involvement of different adnexal tissues or extraocular sites at
  diagnosis p 0.007 , a higher proportion of relapse 67 versus 37 and a shorter relapse-free
  survival p 0.033 . A20 deletion and gain at TNFA B C locus may thus play an important
  role in the development of translocation-negative MALT lymphoma.
