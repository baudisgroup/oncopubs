abstract: Gliomas that aggregate in otherwise unremarkable families may have a heritable
  genetic basis. To determine the spectrum of genetic alterations in glioma-susceptible
  families, we examined tumor DNA from familial cases for regions of chromosomal gain
  or loss using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We compared chromosomal alterations
  within and among glioma families to those found in sporadic gliomas. A specific
  chromosomal abnormality common to the tumors of multiple unrelated probands with
  glioma or a specific chromosomal abnormality common to multiple affected persons
  in a single glioma-prone family would support the hypothesis of an inherited predisposition
  to glioma and at the same time identify specific regions of the genome harboring
  putative glioma susceptibility genes. Tumor DNA from 11 patients from seven families
  with two or more individuals with glioma was analyzed, including three members of
  a remarkable family having 10 affected individuals. We found no chromosomal abnormality
  common to all tumors of all probands nor did we find family-specific abnormalities
  in two of three glioma-prone kindreds. There were frequent copy number aberrations
  CNAs on chromosomes 7, 10, 19, and the sex chromosomes other CNAs included 3q 13.3-29
  , -4q, 5q, -9q34, 12, -13q 21-- amp gt 33 , -15, -16p, 17qter, -18, -21, and -22.
  Amplifications occurred at 2 7p 11.1-- amp gt 12 , 2 7q 21.2-- amp gt 33 , 2 12q
  13.2-- amp gt 14 , and 2 12p 11-- amp gt 12 . Although there were several novel
  CNAs -16p, and 2 12p 11-p12 , none could readily explain the inheritance of these
  tumors.
