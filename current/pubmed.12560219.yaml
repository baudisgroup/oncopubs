abstract: The MALT1 gene was identified through its involvement in t 11 18 q21 q21
  , seen in 30 of cases of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma. Here,
  we show that deregulated MALT1 expression may occur in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
  B-NHL of various histologic subtypes either through translocation to the immunoglobulin
  heavy chain IGH locus or by genomic amplification. First, 2 cases, one case of MALT
  lymphoma and another of aggressive marginal zone lymphoma MZL with t 14 18 q32 q21
  , cytogenetically identical to the translocation involving BCL2, were shown by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH to involve MALT1, which lies about 5 Mb centromeric of
  BCL2. Molecular cloning of both by long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction
  showed breakpoints lying 1 to 2 kilobase kb centromeric of the first 5 MALT1 exon
  both cases showed MALT1 overexpression at either RNA or protein levels. Second,
  we examined the structure and gene expression profile of genomic amplifications
  involving 18q21 in a panel of 40 B-NHL cell lines using comparative genomic hybridization
  to microarrays array CGH and gene expression profiling techniques. Using array CGH,
  2 peaks of genomic amplification were observed, one centered around BCL2 and the
  other around MALT1. Ofthe 3 cell lines with MALT1 amplification, 2 showed MALT1
  overexpression as assessed by gene profiling, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction QRT-PCR , and Western blotting. To determine if comparable events
  occurred in primary MALT and splenic MZL tumors, 40 cases were analyzed by FISH
  or QRT-PCR genomic amplification and MALT1 overexpression were seen in 2 cases.
  Together, these data implicate MALT1 as a dominant oncogene that may play a role
  in the pathogenesis of B-NHL.
