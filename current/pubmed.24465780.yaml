abstract: "BACKGROUND: Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) and circulating tumor cells
  (CTCs) are extremely rare, but comprise the precursors cells of distant metastases
  or therapy resistant cells. The detailed molecular analysis of these cells may help
  to identify key events of cancer cell dissemination, metastatic colony formation
  and systemic therapy escape. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the Ampli1â\x84¢
  whole genome amplification (WGA) technology and high-resolution oligonucleotide
  aCGH microarrays we optimized conditions for the analysis of structural copy number
  changes. The protocol presented here enables reliable detection of numerical genomic
  alterations as small as 0.1 Mb in a single cell. Analysis of single cells from well-characterized
  cell lines and single normal cells confirmed the stringent quantitative nature of
  the amplification and hybridization protocol. Importantly, fixation and staining
  procedures used to detect DCCs showed no significant impact on the outcome of the
  analysis, proving the clinical usability of our method. In a proof-of-principle
  study we tracked the chromosomal changes of single DCCs over a full course of high-dose
  chemotherapy treatment by isolating and analyzing DCCs of an individual breast cancer
  patient at four different time points. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The protocol enables
  detailed genome analysis of DCCs and thereby assessment of the clonal evolution
  during the natural course of the disease and under selection pressures. The results
  from an exemplary patient provide evidence that DCCs surviving selective therapeutic
  conditions may be recruited from a pool of genomically less advanced cells, which
  display a stable subset of specific genomic alterations."
