abstract: To extend the results of conventional cytogenetic analysis of testicular
  germ cell tumors TGCTs , we applied the new molecular cytogenetic method of comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , which enables the detection of chromosomal imbalances
  without the need for dividing cells. DNA from II TGCTs was studied by CGH. In all
  tumors examined, gain of 12p, mostly of the whole p arm, could be demonstrated.
  However, in three tumors, an amplification of 12p material restricted to the chromosomal
  bands 12p11.2-p12.1 was found. Further fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analysis
  using a yeast artificial chromosome YAC that was previously mapped to that region
  revealed multiple copies of that chromosomal segment in interphase nuclei of these
  tumors. This finding is an important clue to the localization of candidate protooncogenes
  at 12p involved in TGCTs. Gains of small chromosomal regions at 2p, 4q, 6p, and
  19p were also detected recurrently. Furthermore, gains of chromosomes 8, 14, 21,
  and X as well as loss of chromosome 13 were frequent findings. In conclusion, CGH
  provides new insights into genetic alterations of TGCTs. By using CGH, chromosomal
  subregions could be identified that may harbor genes involved in the pathogenesis
  of this malignancy.
