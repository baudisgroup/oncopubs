abstract: Small cell lung cancer SCLC accounts for about 15 of all lung cancers. The
  prognosis of SCLC patients is devastating and no biologically targeted therapeutics
  are active in this tumor type. To develop a framework for development of specific
  SCLC-targeted drugs we conducted a combined genomic and pharmacological vulnerability
  screen in SCLC cell lines. We show that SCLC cell lines capture the genomic landscape
  of primary SCLC tumors and provide genetic predictors for activity of clinically
  relevant inhibitors by screening 267 compounds across 44 of these cell lines. We
  show Aurora kinase inhibitors are effective in SCLC cell lines bearing MYC amplification,
  which occur in 3-7 of SCLC patients. In MYC-amplified SCLC cells Aurora kinase inhibition
  associates with G2 M-arrest, inactivation of PI3-kinase PI3K signaling, and induction
  of apoptosis. Aurora dependency in SCLC primarily involved Aurora B, required its
  kinase activity, and was independent of depletion of cytoplasmic levels of MYC.
  Our study suggests that a fraction of SCLC patients may benefit from therapeutic
  inhibition of Aurora B. Thus, thorough chemical and genomic exploration of SCLC
  cell lines may provide starting points for further development of rational targeted
  therapeutic intervention in this deadly tumor type.
