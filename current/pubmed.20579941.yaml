abstract: Annotation of prostate cancer genomes provides a foundation for discoveries
  that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Concordant assessment of DNA
  copy number, mRNA expression, and focused exon resequencing in 218 prostate cancer
  tumors identified the nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA2 as an oncogene in approximately
  11 of tumors. Additionally, the androgen-driven TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was associated
  with a previously unrecognized, prostate-specific deletion at chromosome 3p14 that
  implicates FOXP1, RYBP, and SHQ1 as potential cooperative tumor suppressors. DNA
  copy-number data from primary tumors revealed that copy-number alterations robustly
  define clusters of low- and high-risk disease beyond that achieved by Gleason score.
  The genomic and clinical outcome data from these patients are now made available
  as a public resource.
