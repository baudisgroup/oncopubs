abstract: This study was performed to investigate whether the response to neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy in ductal-type breast cancer could be predicted by different genomic
  alterations. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was performed on
  samples from 15 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin
  plus docetaxel ED . Frozen tissue bank samples were retrospectively selected from
  8 patients who demonstrated complete pathologic response pCR and from 7 patients
  resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We performed aCGH with 4,277 human bacterial
  artificial chromosome BAC clones, scanning the genome for DNA copy number changes.
  In a cluster dendrogram of aCGH data, responders showed changes clustered in S940,
  S984, S44, S98, S130, S115, S478, and 1150T, whereas non-responder group changes
  clustered in S1029, S209, S219, S660, S133, S323, and S670. Compared to responders,
  non-responders showed more complicated genomic alterations the most common gains
  were located at chromosome 8q 717 , 13q 71 , and 20q 57 , with the smallest regions
  of genomic gain at 8q24.3, 8q24.22, 8q24.21, 8q22.1, 8q22.2, 8q22.3, 13q21.1, 20q13.2,
  and 20q13.33. The most frequently deleted regions were observed on chromosome 8p
  71 and 17p 57 , with the smallest regions of deletion at 8p23.3, 8p23.2, 8p23.1,
  8p21.3, 8p21.2, and 17p13.3. The results of the current study suggest that aberrations
  in chromosome 8 may contribute to the resistance to taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  in ductal-type breast cancer. Results of our study indicate that candidate gene
  identification through aCGH should be validated by specific gene analysis since
  the sites of chromosomal aberration are quite different among studies.
