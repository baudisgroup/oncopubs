abstract: We have used a combination of gene expression profiling, array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH , fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH and tissue microarrays
  TMAs to investigate chromosome 11 genetic changes in subsets of benign parathyroid
  tumors. Integration of gene expression profiling and aCGH was done using differential
  gene locus mapping analysis. We have identified three distinct relatively common
  chromosome 11 genomic changes in various subsets of parathyroid tumors. The simplest
  and least common of these genomic changes involves translocation of the CCND1 gene
  with subsequent strong CCND1 expression. This genetic change is essentially limited
  to parathyroid adenomas 8 , although expression of CCND1 without translocation is
  common in uremic hyperparathyroidism. Not surprisingly, deletion of the MEN1 locus
  at 11q13 or loss of a large portion or an entire chromosome 11 was a common finding.
  This particular genomic change appears to have a prominent effect on the overall
  results of gene expression profiling and was present in slightly less than one-half
  of adenomas. Genomic changes in primary nonfamilial hyperplasia were for the most
  part restricted to 11q13 deletion or loss of chromosome 11. The third genomic change
  we identified was 11q23 deletion. This genetic change was relatively independent
  of other chromosome 11 changes and present in slightly less than one-half of adenomas.
  11q23 deletion along with relatively strong CCND1 expression was common in uremic
  hyperparathyroidism.
