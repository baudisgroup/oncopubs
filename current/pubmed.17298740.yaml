abstract: Some researches have showed that chromosomal abnormalities, including chromosomal
  regions of gains and losses, usually occur in primary esophageal cancer. The comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH technique can show chromosomal abnormality. This study
  was to analyze the characteristics of chromosomal abnormity in primary esophageal
  cancer by CGH, and explore its correlation to prognosis.
