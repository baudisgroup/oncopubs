abstract: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders PTLD are complications of
  solid organ transplantation associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL represents the most common form of monomorphic PTLD.
  We studied 44 cases of post-transplant DLBCL PT-DLBCL with high-density genome wide
  single nucleotide polymorphism-based arrays, and compared them with 105 cases of
  immunocompetent DLBCL IC-DLBCL and 28 cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-associated
  DLBCL HIV-DLBCL . PT-DLBCL showed a genomic profile with specific features, although
  their genomic complexity was overall similar to that observed in IC- and HIV-DLBCL.
  Among the loci more frequently deleted in PT-DLBCL there were small interstitial
  deletions targeting known fragile sites, such as FRA1B, FRA2E and FRA3B. Deletions
  at 2p16.1 FRA2E were the most common lesions in PT-DLBCL, occurring at a frequency
  that was significantly higher than in IC-DLBCL. Genetic lesions that characterized
  post-germinal center IC-DLBCL were under-represented in our series of PT-DLBCL.
  Two other differences between IC-DLBCL and PT-DLBCL were the lack of del 13q14.3
  MIR15 MIR16 and of copy neutral LOH affecting 6p major histocompatibility complex
  MHC locus in the latter group. In conclusion, PT-DLBCL presented unique features
  when compared with IC-DLBCL. Changes in PT-DLBCL were partially different to those
  in HIV-DLBCL, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms in the two conditions
  linked to immunodeficiency.
