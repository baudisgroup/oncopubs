abstract: 'This report delivers a comprehensive genetic alteration profile of lung
  adenocarcinomas (LADCs) driven by ALK, RET and ROS1 oncogene fusions. These tumors
  are difficult to study because of their rarity: each drives only a low percentage
  of LADCs. Whole exome sequencing and copy number variation analyses were performed
  on a Japanese LADC cohort (n = 200) enriched in patients with fusions (n = 31, 15.5%),
  followed by deep re-sequencing for validation. The driver fusion cases showed a
  distinct profile with smaller numbers of non-synonymous mutations in cancer-related
  genes or truncating mutations in SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex genes than
  in other LADCs (P < 0.0001). This lower mutation rate was independent of age, gender,
  smoking status, pathological stage, and tumor differentiation (P < 0.0001) and was
  validated in nine fusion-positive cases from a US LADCs cohort (n = 230). In conclusion,
  our findings indicate that LADCs with ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusions develop exclusively
  via their dependence on these oncogene fusions. The presence of such few alterations
  beyond the fusions supports the use of monotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  targeting the fusion products in fusion-positive LADCs.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015, American
