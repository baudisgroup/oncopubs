abstract: Leiomyosarcoma LMS is a soft tissue tumor with a significant degree of morphologic
  and molecular heterogeneity. We used integrative molecular profiling to discover
  and characterize molecular subtypes of LMS. Gene expression profiling was performed
  on 51 LMS samples. Unsupervised clustering showed three reproducible LMS clusters.
  Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was performed on 20 LMS samples and
  showed that the molecular subtypes defined by gene expression showed distinct genomic
  changes. Tumors from the muscle-enriched cluster showed significantly increased
  copy number changes P 0.04 . A majority of the muscle-enriched cases showed loss
  at 16q24, which contains Fanconi anemia, complementation group A, known to have
  an important role in DNA repair, and loss at 1p36, which contains PRDM16, of which
  loss promotes muscle differentiation. Immunohistochemistry IHC was performed on
  LMS tissue microarrays n 377 for five markers with high levels of messenger RNA
  in the muscle-enriched cluster ACTG2, CASQ2, SLMAP, CFL2 and MYLK and showed significantly
  correlated expression of the five proteins all pairwise P amp lt 0.005 . Expression
  of the five markers was associated with improved disease-specific survival in a
  multivariate Cox regression analysis P amp lt 0.04 . In this analysis that combined
  gene expression profiling, aCGH and IHC, we characterized distinct molecular LMS
  subtypes, provided insight into their pathogenesis, and identified prognostic biomarkers.
