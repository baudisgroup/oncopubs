abstract: Neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) is a rare disorder characterized
  by major hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone levels, and marked enlargement
  of multiple parathyroid glands, usually associated with germline mutations in the
  calcium receptor gene CASR. However, little is known about the outgrowth of parathyroid
  tumors in NSHPT, including whether they represent monoclonal or polyclonal expansions.
  We sought to examine the clonality of parathyroid tissues resected from a patient
  with NSHPT and biallelic CASR mutations. DNA from two distinct parathyroid tumors
  resected from a girl with NSHPT, plus polyclonal/monoclonal control samples, were
  subjected to analyses of clonality by two independent methods, X-chromosome inactivation
  analysis at the androgen receptor locus (HUMARA) and BAC array comparative genomic
  hybridization (CGH). Both parathyroid tumor samples revealed polyclonal patterns
  by X-inactivation analysis, with polyclonal and monoclonal controls yielding the
  expected patterns. Similarly, by BAC array CGH, neither parathyroid sample contained
  monoclonal copy number changes and both appeared identical to the patient-matched
  polyclonal controls. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence that
  the markedly enlarged parathyroid tumors in the setting of NSHPT constitute polyclonal,
  generalized hyperplastic growths rather than monoclonal neoplasms. ï¿½ 2015 American
