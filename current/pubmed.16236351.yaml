abstract: Amplification of the 11q13 locus is commonly observed in a number of human
  cancers including both breast and ovarian cancer. Cyclin D1 and EMS1 have been implicated
  as candidate oncogenes involved in the emergence of amplification at this locus.
  Detailed analysis of the 11q13 amplicon in breast cancer led to the discovery of
  four regions of amplification suggesting the involvement of other genes. Here, we
  investigate the role of EMSY, a recently described BRCA2 interacting protein, as
  a key element of the 11q13 amplicon in ovarian cancer. EMSY maps to 11q13.5 and
  is amplified in 13 of breast and 17 of ovarian carcinomas.
