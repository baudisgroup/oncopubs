abstract: Small-cell lung cancer SCLC is the most aggressive subtype of lung cancer
  in its clinical behavior, with a 5-year overall survival as low as 5 . Despite years
  of research in the field, molecular determinants of SCLC behavior are still poorly
  understood, and this deficiency has translated into an absence of specific diagnostics
  and targeted therapeutics. We hypothesized that tumor DNA copy number alterations
  would allow the identification of molecular pathways involved in SCLC progression.
  Array comparative genomic hybridization was performed on DNA extracted from 46 formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded SCLC tissue specimens. Genomic profiling of tumor and sex-matched
  control DNA allowed the identification of 70 regions of copy number gain and 55
  regions of copy number loss. Using molecular pathway analysis, we found a strong
  enrichment in these regions of copy number alterations for 11 genes associated with
  the focal adhesion pathway. We verified these findings at the genomic, gene expression
  and protein level. Focal Adhesion Kinase FAK , one of the central genes represented
  in this pathway, was commonly expressed in SCLC tumors and constitutively phosphorylated
  in SCLC cell lines. Those were poorly adherent to most substrates but not to laminin-322.
  Inhibition of FAK phosphorylation at Tyr 397 by a small-molecule inhibitor, PF-573,228,
  induced a dose-dependent decrease of adhesion and an increase of spreading in SCLC
  cell lines on laminin-322. Cells that tended to spread also showed a decrease in
  focal adhesions, as demonstrated by a decreased vinculin expression. These results
  support the concept that pathway analysis of genes in regions of copy number alterations
  may uncover molecular mechanisms of disease progression and demonstrate a new role
  of FAK and associated adhesion pathways in SCLC. Further investigations of FAK at
  the functional level may lead to a better understanding of SCLC progression and
  may have therapeutic implications.
