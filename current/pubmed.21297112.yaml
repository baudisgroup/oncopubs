abstract: Tumor suppressor genes are often located in frequently deleted chromosomal
  regions of colorectal cancers CRCs . In contrast to microsatellite stable MSS tumors,
  only few loss of heterozygosity LOH studies were performed in microsatellite instable
  MSI tumors, because MSI carcinomas are generally considered to be chromosomally
  stable and classical LOH studies are not feasible due to MSI. The single nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP array technique enables LOH studies also in MSI CRC. The aim of
  our study was to analyse tissue from MSI and MSS CRC for the existence of frequently
  deleted chromosomal regions and tumor suppressor genes located therein.
