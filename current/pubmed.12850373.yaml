abstract: Colorectal cancer CRC is one of the most common malignancies worldwide.
  The incidence of CRC in the Chinese population has increased dramatically during
  the last two decades however, nonrandom chromosomal alterations in Chinese patients
  have not been described. In the present study, comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH was applied to detect recurrent chromosome alterations in 26 primary colorectal
  carcinomas and 21 colorectal adenomas from Chinese patients. In CRC, several recurrent
  chromosomal changes were found, including gains of 8q 14 26 cases, 54 , 20q 54 ,
  3q 50 , 13q 50 , 5p 46 , 7p 42 , 7q 42 , and 12p 38 and losses of 18q 65 and 17p
  42 . From comparison with previous CGH studies, the frequent gains of 3q and 12p
  might be distinctive occurrences in Chinese patients. The distribution of frequently
  found chromosomal alterations in different locations was studied. The gain of 20q
  was more frequently found in colon cancer P amp lt 0.01 and the gain of 12p was
  more frequently found in rectal cancer. Chromosomal alterations were found in 19
  21 of adenomas the most frequent chromosomal alteration was the loss of 18q 9 21
  cases, 43 . These recurrent alterations provide several starting points for the
  isolation of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
