abstract: 'To define the patterns of genetic imbalances in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  NPC , we studied 30 primary NPC tumors with comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . The common sites of chromosomal gains were found in descending order of frequency
  in 12p11.2-p12 36 , 12q14-q21 33 , 2q24-q31 23 , 1q31-qter 20 , 3q13 20 , 1q13.3
  20 , 5q21 17 , 6q14-q22 13 , 7q21 13 , 8q11.2-q23 13 and 18q12-qter 13 . The common
  sites of chromosomal loss were at 3p14-p21 20 , 11q23-qter 20 , 16q21-qter 17 and
  14q24-qter 13 . Correlation with clinicopathologic features showed that 3p loss
  was associated with a significantly higher risk of death related to recurrence as
  compared with patients without 3p loss 50 vs. 9 , P .029 . The presence of 16q loss
  was associated with more advanced stage tumors stages I amp amp II: 6 vs. stages
  III amp amp IV: 33 , P .046 . We conclude that consistent patterns of genetic imbalances
  can be observed in NPC. Deletion of 3p and 16q were associated with higher risk
  of tumor recurrence and advanced stage cancer.'
