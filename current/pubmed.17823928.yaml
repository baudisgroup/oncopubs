abstract: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma PMBCL is a distinct subtype of diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma. PMBCL has been previously studied with a variety of genomic
  techniques resulting in frequent detection of chromosomal gains however, chromosomal
  losses have been rarely reported. This finding contrasts many other types of lymphoma,
  in which deletions are common. We hypothesize that segmental losses do exist but
  may have escaped detection by methods used in the previous studies. Using array
  comparative genomic hybridization to a tiling-resolution microarray encompassing
  the entire human genome, PMBCL samples were analyzed for genomic copy number alterations.
  An almost equal number of gains and losses of chromosomal material were detected
  throughout the genome 216 vs. 193, respectively . A selection of these DNA copy
  number alterations were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Recurrent gains
  were detected at all previously reported regions of gain, including 9p seen in approximately
  70 of cases. Recurrent chromosomal losses were observed at 1p, 3p, 4q, 6q, 7p, and
  17p, with a novel event at 1p13.1-p13.2 representing the most frequent at 42 of
  cases analyzed. We conclude that consistent losses are present in the PMBCL genome.
  Given the similar frequency of losses to that of segmental gains of DNA, they are
  likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PMBCL.
