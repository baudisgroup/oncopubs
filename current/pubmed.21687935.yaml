abstract: 'Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, marked by extensive chromosomal
  aberrations. In this study, we aimed to explicate the underlying chromosomal copy
  number CN alterations and loss of heterozygosity LOH implicated in a cohort of Malaysian
  hospital-based primary breast carcinoma samples using a single nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP array platform. The analysis was conducted by hybridizing the extracted DNA
  of 70 primary breast carcinomas and 37 normal peripheral blood samples to the Affymetrix
  250K Sty SNP arrays. Locus-specific CN aberrations and LOH were statistically summarized
  using the binary segmentation algorithm and hidden Markov model. Selected genes
  from the SNP array analysis were also validated using quantitative real-time PCR.
  The merging of CN and LOH data fabricated distinctive integrated alteration profiles,
  which were comprised of finely demarcated minimal sites of aberrations. The most
  prevalent gains  30 were detected at the 8q arm: 8q23.1, 8q23.3, 8q24.11, 8q24.13,
  8q24.21, 8q24.22, 8q24.23 and 8q24.3, whilst the most ubiquitous losses  20 were
  noted at the 8p12, 8p21.1, 8p21.2, 8p21.1-p21.2, 8p21.3, 8p22, 8p23.1, 8p23.1 p23.2,
  8p23.3, 17p11.2, 17p12, 17p11.2-p12, 17p13.1 and 17p13.2 regions. Copy-neutral LOH
  was characterized as the most prevailing LOH event, in which the most frequent distributions  30
  were revealed at 3p21.31, 5q33.2, 12q24.12, 12q24.12 q24.13 and 14q23.1. These findings
  offer compre-hensive genome-wide views on breast cancer genomic changes, where the
  most recurrent gain, loss and copy-neutral LOH events were harboured within the
  8q24.21, 8p21.1 and 14q23.1 loci, respectively. This will facilitate the uncovering
  of true driver genes pertinent to breast cancer biology and the develop-ment of
  prospective therapeutics.'
