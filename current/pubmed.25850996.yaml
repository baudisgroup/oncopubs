abstract: The efficacy of curative surgery for lung cancer could be largely improved
  by non-invasive screening programs, which can detect the disease at early stages.
  We previously showed that 18% of screening-identified lung cancers demonstrate a
  normal karyotype and, following high-density genome scanning, can be subdivided
  into samples with 1) numerous; 2) none; and 3) few copy number alterations. Whole
  exome sequencing was applied to the two normal karyotype, screening-detected lung
  cancers, constituting group 2, as well as normal controls. We identified mutations
  in both tumors, including KEAP1 (commonly mutated in lung cancers) in one, and TP53,
  PMS1, and MSH3 (well-characterized DNA-repair genes) in the other. The two normal
  karyotype screening-detected lung tumors displayed a typical lung cancer mutational
  profile that only next generation sequencing could reveal, which offered an additional
  contribution to the over-diagnosis bias concept hypothesized within lung cancer
  screening programs.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
