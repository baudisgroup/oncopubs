abstract: Recurrent karyotypic abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cervical
  cancer CC cells, which may result in deregulated expression of important genes that
  contribute to tumor initiation and progression. To examine the role of gain of the
  long arm of chromosome 20 20q , one of the common chromosomal gains in CC, we evaluated
  CC at various stages of progression using single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array,
  gene expression profiling, and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analyses.
  This analysis revealed copy number increase CNI of 20q in amp gt 50 of invasive
  CC and identified two focal amplicons at 20q11.2 and 20q13.13 in a subset of tumors.
  We further demonstrate that the acquisition of 20q gain occurs at an early stage
  in CC development and the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions HSIL that
  exhibit 20q CNI are associated P 0.05 with persistence or progression to invasive
  cancer. We identified a total of 26 overexpressed genes as consequence of 20q gain
  N 14 , as targets of amplicon 1 N 9 two genes also commonly expressed with 20q gain
  and amplicon 2 N 6 one gene also commonly expressed with 20q gain . These include
  a number of functionally important genes in cell cycle regulation E2F1, TPX2, KIF3B,
  PIGT, and B4GALT5 , nuclear function CSEL1 , viral replication PSMA7 and LAMA5 ,
  methylation and chromatin remodeling ASXL1, AHCY, and C20orf20 , and transcription
  regulation TCEA2 . Our findings implicate a role for these genes in CC tumorigenesis,
  represent an important step toward the development of clinically significant biomarkers,
  and form a framework for testing as molecular therapeutic targets.
