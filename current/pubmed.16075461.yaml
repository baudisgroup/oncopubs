abstract: 'Understanding the genes and genetic pathways targeted by recurrent chromosomal
  imbalances in malignancy, along with the molecular mechanisms that generate the
  imbalances, are important problems in cancer biology. In this report, we demonstrate
  that oligonucleotide array CGH oaCGH analysis can routinely map chromosomal imbalance
  breakpoints at exon-level resolution, including imbalances that are single copy
  number genomic alterations. Different tiling-path array designs were used in this
  study: a whole-genome array with a 6-kb median probe spacing and fine-tiling arrays
  for selected genomic regions with either 50- or 140-bp median probe spacing. In
  both array formats, oligonucleotide probes were of isothermal design and were tiled
  through genic and inter-genic regions. Whole-genome oaCGH analysis of two neuroblastoma
  cell lines and three primary tumors led to the identification of 58 chromosomal
  breakpoints that generated 45 large-scale partial chromosomal imbalances amp gt
  2 Mb . An unexpectedly high proportion 34 of these breakpoint intervals mapped to
  regions containing segmental duplications. In addition, 88 smaller-sized regions
  amp lt 2 Mb of imbalance were detected, the majority of which mapped to segmentally
  duplicated regions and may reflect constitutional copy number polymorphisms. The
  chromosomal breakpoints for 12 recurrent abnormalities exhibited in neuroblastoma
  tumors and cell lines, including MYCN amplicon boundaries, loss of 3p, loss of 11q,
  and gain of 17q, could be mapped to intervals ranging from 50 bp to 10 kb in size
  using high-density fine-tiling oligonucleotide microarrays. Fine-tiling oaCGH analysis
  provides an unprecedented level of resolution, allowing detailed mapping of recurrent
  unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities. Supplementary material for this article can
