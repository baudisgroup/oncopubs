abstract: Angiosarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of malignant vascular tumors
  occurring in different anatomic sites. In the female breast, they account for less
  than 1 of all malignant tumors and mainly develop as secondary angiosarcomas after
  prior irradiation. Data on cytogenetic findings in angiosarcomas are scarce and
  up to now no characteristic primary aberrations have been established. We herein
  add molecular cytogenetic findings in another 4 angiosarcomas to 11 previously reported
  cases.
