abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC is a common, morbid, and frequently
  lethal malignancy. To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing
  data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational profile consistent
  with tobacco exposure human papillomavirus was detectable by sequencing DNA from
  infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes TP53, CDKN2A,
  PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS , our analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated
  in this malignancy. At least 30 of cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate
  squamous differentiation for example, NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63 , implicating its dysregulation
  as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate
  the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.
