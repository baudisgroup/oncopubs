abstract: Identification of genetic losses and gains is valuable in analysis of brain
  tumors. Locus-by-locus analyses have revealed correlations between prognosis and
  response to chemotherapy and loss or gain of specific genes and loci. These approaches
  are labor intensive and do not provide a global view of the genetic changes within
  the tumor cells. Bacterial artificial chromosome BAC arrays, which cover the genome
  with an average resolution of less than 1 MbP, allow defining the sum total of these
  genetic changes in a single comparative genomic hybridization CGH experiment. These
  changes are directly overlaid on the human genome sequence, thus providing the extent
  of the amplification or deletion, reflected by a megabase position, and gene content
  of the abnormal region. Although this array-based CGH approach CGHa seems to detect
  the extent of the genetic changes in tumors reliably, it has not been robustly tested.
  We compared genetic changes in four newly derived, early-passage glioma cell lines,
  using spectral karyotyping SKY and CGHa. Chromosome changes seen in cell lines under
  SKY analysis were also detected with CGHa. In addition, CGHa detected cryptic genetic
  gains and losses and resolved the nature of subtle marker chromosomes that could
  not be resolved with SKY, thus providing distinct advantages over previous technologies.
  There was remarkable general concordance between the CGHa results comparing the
  cell lines to the original tumor, except that the magnitude of the changes seen
  in the tumor sample was generally suppressed compared with the cell lines, a consequence
  of normal cells contaminating the tumor sample. CGHa revealed changes in cell lines
  that were not present in the original tumors and vice versa, even when analyzed
  at the earliest passage possible, which highlights the adaptation of the cells to
  in vitro culture. CGHa proved to be highly accurate and efficient for identifying
  genetic changes in tumor cells. This approach can accurately identify subtle, novel
  genetic abnormalities in tumors directly linked to the human genome sequence. CGHa
  far surpasses the resolution and information provided by conventional metaphase
  CGH, without relying on in vitro culture of tumors for metaphase spreads.
