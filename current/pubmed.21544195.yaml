abstract: Wilms tumor WT has been a model to study kidney embryogenesis and tumorigenesis
  and, although associated with hereditary, cancer predisposition syndromes, the majority
  of tumors occur sporadically. To analyze genetic changes in WT we have defined copy
  number changes and loss of heterozygosity in 56 Wilms tumors using high resolution
  oligonucleotide arrays at a average resolution of 12 Kb. Consistent deletions were
  seen on chromosomes 1p, 4q, 7p, 9q, 11p, 11q, 14q, 16q, and 21q. High frequency
  gains were seen for 1q and lower frequency gains were seen on 7q and chromosomes
  8, 12 and 18. The high resolution provided by the SNP mapping arrays has defined
  minimal regions of deletion for many of these LOH events. Analysis of CNAs by tumor
  stage show relatively stable karyotypes in stage 1 tumors and more complex aCGH
  profiles in tumors from stages 3-5.
