abstract: Non-melanoma skin cancers, in particular keratoacanthomas KAs and squamous
  cell carcinomas SCCs , have become highly frequent tumor types especially in immune-suppressed
  transplant patients. Nevertheless, little is known about essential genetic changes.
  As a paradigm of early changes, that is, changes still compatible with tumor regression,
  we studied KAs by comparative genomic hybridization and show that gain of chromosome
  11q is not only one of the most frequent aberration 8 18 , but in four tumors also
  the only aberration. Furthermore, 11q gain correlated with amplification of the
  cyclin D1 locus 10 14 , as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and
  overexpression of cyclin D1 protein 25 31 , as detected by immunohistochemistry.
  For unraveling the functional consequence, we overexpressed cyclin D1 in HaCaT skin
  keratinocytes. These cells only gained little growth advantage in conventional and
  in organotypic co-cultures. However, although the control vector-transfected cells
  formed a well-stratified and orderly differentiated epidermis-like epithelium, they
  showed deregulation of tissue architecture with an altered localization of proliferation
  and impaired differentiation. The most severe phenotype was seen in a clone that
  additionally upregulated cdk4 and p21. These cells lacked terminal differentiation,
  exhibited a more autonomous growth in vitro and in vivo and even formed tumors in
  two injection sites with a growth pattern resembling that of human KAs. Thus, our
  results identify 11q13 gain cyclin D1 overexpression as an important step in KA
  formation and point to a function that exceeds its known role in proliferation by
  disrupting tissue organization and thereby allowing abnormal growth.
