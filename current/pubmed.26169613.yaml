abstract: Two phase II studies assessed the efficacy of vismodegib, a sonic hedgehog
  (SHH) pathway inhibitor that binds smoothened (SMO), in pediatric and adult recurrent
  medulloblastoma (MB).  Adult patients enrolled onto PBTC-025B and pediatric patients
  enrolled onto PBTC-032 were treated with vismodegib (150 to 300 mg/d). Protocol-defined
  response, which had to be sustained for 8 weeks, was confirmed by central neuroimaging
  review. Molecular tests to identify patterns of response and insensitivity were
  performed when tissue was available.  A total of 31 patients were enrolled onto
  PBTC-025B, and 12 were enrolled onto PBTC-032. Three patients in PBTC-025B and one
  in PBTC-032, all with SHH-subgroup MB (SHH-MB), exhibited protocol-defined responses.
  Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in those with SHH-MB than in those with
  non-SHH-MB, and prolonged disease stabilization occurred in 41% of patient cases
  of SHH-MB. Among those with SHH-MB, loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 was associated
  with prolonged PFS, and diffuse staining of P53 was associated with reduced PFS.
  Whole-exome sequencing identified mutations in SHH genes downstream from SMO in
  four of four tissue samples from nonresponders and upstream of SMO in two of four
  patients with favorable responses.  Vismodegib exhibits activity against adult recurrent
  SHH-MB but not against recurrent non-SHH-MB. Inadequate accrual of pediatric patients
  precluded conclusions in this population. Molecular analyses support the hypothesis
  that SMO inhibitor activity depends on the genomic aberrations within the tumor.
  Such inhibitors should be advanced in SHH-MB studies; however, molecular and genomic
  work remains imperative to identify target populations that will truly benefit.  ï¿½
