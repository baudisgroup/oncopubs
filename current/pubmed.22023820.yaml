abstract: We describe a bioinformatic tool, Tumor Aberration Prediction Suite TAPS
  , for the identification of allele-specific copy numbers in tumor samples using
  data from Affymetrix SNP arrays. It includes detailed visualization of genomic segment
  characteristics and iterative pattern recognition for copy number identification,
  and does not require patient-matched normal samples. TAPS can be used to identify
  chromosomal aberrations with high sensitivity even when the proportion of tumor
  cells is as low as 30 . Analysis of cancer samples indicates that TAPS is well suited
  to investigate samples with aneuploidy and tumor heterogeneity, which is commonly
  found in many types of solid tumors.
