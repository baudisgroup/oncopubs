abstract: Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the world. Urothelial
  carcinoma formerly known as transitional cell carcinoma comprises the majority of
  bladder cancers. In order to decipher the genetic alteration leading to the carcinogenesis
  of urothelial cancer, we performed genome-wide allelotyping analysis using 384 microsatellite
  markers spanning 22 autosomes together with comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  in 21 urothelial cancer. High frequency of allelic imbalance was observed in chromosome
  arm 1q 61.9 , 3p 61.9 , 4q 66.67 , 8p 57.14 , 9p 76.2 and 9q 66.67 . Allelic imbalance
  with frequency above average was also observed in chromosome arm 2q, 10p, 10q, 11p,
  11q, 12q, 13q, 15q, 17p and 19q. The allelic imbalance of each case and fractional
  allelic loss for each chromosome was associated with higher tumor grade and stage
  P amp lt 0.05 . We have also delineated several minimal deletion regions on chromosome
  3p, 4q, 8p, 9p, 9q, 11p, 13q, 16q and 17p. By CGH analysis, common chromosomal alterations
  included gain of 1p, 1q, 12q, 16p, 17q and 19p as well as loss of 4q and 9p in most
  of the cases. Our findings may provide valuable information to locate putative oncogenes
  and tumor suppressor genes in the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer in this locality.
