abstract: EWS-ERG Ewing sarcoma ES gene fusions often result from complex chromosomal
  rearrangements. We report an unusually aggressive case of ES with an EWS-ERG fusion
  gene that appeared to be a result of a simple balanced and reciprocal translocation,
  t 19 22 q13.2 q12.2 . Subsequent molecular investigation of the primary tumor, the
  metastasis, and a cell line generated from this ES permitted reconstruction of each
  genomic step in the evolution of this complex EWS-ERG fusion. We elucidated a new
  mechanism of reciprocal insertion inversion between chromosome 21 and 22, involving
  cryptic alterations to both the ERG and EWS genes. Molecular cytogenetic investigation,
  using systematic analysis with locus-specific probes, identified the cognate genomic
  breakpoints within chromosome 21 and 22, mandatory for the excision and exchange
  of both 3ERG and 3EWS, resulting in the formation of the EWS-ERG fusion gene present
  on the der 22 . Array comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization studies of the ES cell line derived from this tumor identified additional
  acquired chromosomal and genomic abnormalities, likely associated with establishment
  and adaptation to in vitro growth. Notably, the cell line had lost one copy of the
  RB1 gene within the 13q13.1 approximately q14.2 region, and also had a near-tetraploid
  karyotype. The significance of these findings and their relationship to other reports
  of variant and complex ES translocations involving the ERG gene are reviewed.
