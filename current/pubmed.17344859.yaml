abstract: Chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
  ALL but alone fail to induce leukaemia. To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions,
  we performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL patients
  using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic DNA sequencing.
  Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and structural rearrangement
  in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte development and differentiation
  in 40 of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene was the most frequent target of somatic
  mutation, being altered in 31.7 of cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted
  in reduced levels of PAX5 protein or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions
  were also detected in TCF3 also known as E2A , EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 IKAROS and IKZF3
  AIOLOS . These findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell
  development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis. Moreover,
  these data demonstrate the power of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches to identify
  new molecular lesions in cancer.
