abstract: Elastofibroma is a rare, benign, slow-growing degenerative pseudotumor that
  typically occurs in the subscapular region and has been considered a peculiar fibroblastic
  proliferation with accumulation of abnormal elastic fibers. Very little is known
  about the cytogenetic and molecular genetic changes in elastofibroma. In the present
  study, we analyzed DNA copy number changes in 27 elastofibromas by comparative genomic
  hybridization. DNA was extracted from 22 archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissues
  and from 5 fresh frozen samples. Nine 33 of the 27 cases exhibited DNA copy number
  changes involving one or two chromosomes, whereas the remaining 18 cases exhibited
  no DNA copy number changes. The majority of the changes were gains 8 cases , whereas
  2 cases showed losses. The most common recurrent gains were at chromosomal locations
  Xq12-q22 6 cases and 19 2 cases . High-level amplifications and recurrent losses
  were not observed. There was no correlation between DNA copy number changes and
  the pseudotumor size. The present study has identified a chromosomal region that
  may contain genes involved in the development of at least some elastofibromas.
