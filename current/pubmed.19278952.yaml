abstract: MicroRNA miRNA deregulation contributes to cancer pathogenesis. However,
  analysis of miRNAs in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL has been hindered by a
  focus on cell lines, limited number of miRNAs examined, and lack of copy number
  data. To address these restrictions, we investigated genomewide miRNA expression
  and copy number data in 86 DLBCLs. Permutation analysis showed that 63 miRNAs were
  recurrently disrupted in DLBCL, including highly expressed oncomirs not previously
  linked to chromosomal abnormalities. Further, using training and validation tumor
  groups, we defined a collection of miRNAs that robustly segregates DLBCLs into 3
  subsets, which are independent of the cell-of-origin classification, extent of T-cell
  infiltrate, and tumor site. Instead, these unique miRNA-driven DLBCL subgroups showed
  markedly different MYC transcriptional activity, which explained the dominance of
  miRNAs regulated by MYC in their expression signatures. In addition, analysis of
  miRNA expression patterns of normal B cells and integration of copy number and expression
  data showed that genomic abnormalities and the genetic fingerprint of nonmalignant
  cells also contribute to the miRNA profile of DLBCL. In conclusion, we created a
  comprehensive map of the miRNA genome in DLBCL and, in the process, have uncovered
  and mechanistically elucidated the basis for additional molecular heterogeneity
  in this tumor.
