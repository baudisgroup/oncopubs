abstract: To identify putative biomarkers in squamous cell carcinoma SCC , a survey
  of parallel chromosomal alterations and gene expression studies in 10 SCC cell lines
  were performed using array-comparative genomic hybridization CGH and oligo-microarray
  techniques. The most frequent changes were gains of 11q13.1-13.3 and losses of 18q12.1-23
  in SCC. Furthermore, the expression levels of the sets of genes at both these loci
  in SCC were measured using microarray analysis. By combining the array-CGH with
  the microarray data, 10 genes at 11q13.1-13.3 and 6 genes at 18q12.1-23 whose expression
  correlated with chromosomal alterations were identified. To verify the expression
  levels of the identified genes, we used expression analysis data derived from our
  earlier study of clinical specimens. In clinical samples, six genes GAL, GSTP1,
  MRPL11, MRPL21, SF3B2, and YIF1A at 11q13.1-13.3 and one gene GALR1 at 18q23 showed
  a significant difference between normal and tumor samples. GAL, coding for the neuropeptide
  galanin, and GALR1, a galanin receptor, were identified as candidate genes of oncogenesis
  in SCC. The expression levels of GAL, GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3 were confirmed by
  real-time PCR. The expression ratio between GAL and GALR1 showed a significant negative
  correlation. GALR1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that activates GTP-binding proteins
  to trigger signaling cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway,
  and is a well-established mitogenic pathway. This further supports the hypothesis
  that the genes involved in the GAL signaling cascade are candidates for regulation
  of oncogenesis in SCC.
