abstract: Using comparative genomic hybridisation, we have analysed genetic imbalance
  in a series of 86 ependymomas from children and adults. Tumours were derived from
  intracranial and spinal sites, and classified histologically as classic, anaplastic
  or myxopapillary. Ependymomas showing a balanced profile were significantly P amp
  lt 0.0005 more frequent in children than adults. Profiles suggesting intermediate
  ploidy were common 44 of all tumours , and found more often P amp lt 0.0005 in tumours
  from adults and the spinal region. Loss of 22q was the most common specific abnormality,
  occurring in 50 of spinal medullary ependymomas and 26 of tumours overall. Genetic
  profiles combining loss of 22q with other specific abnormalities--gain of 1q, loss
  of 6q, loss of 10q 10, loss of 13, loss of 14q 14--varied according to site and
  histology. In particular, we showed that classic ependymomas from within the cranium
  and spine have distinct genetic profiles. Classic and anaplastic ependymomas with
  gain of 1q tended to occur in the posterior fossa of children and to behave aggressively.
  Our extensive data on ependymomas demonstrate significant associations between genetic
  aberrations and clinicopathological variables, and represent a starting point for
  further biological and clinical studies.
