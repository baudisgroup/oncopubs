abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect changes in relative
  chromosome copy number in 50 cases of peripheral nerve sheath tumour PNSTs , including
  nine malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours MPNSTs , 27 neurofibromas with three
  plexiform neurofibromas and 14 schwannomas. Chromosome imbalances were frequently
  detected in benign as well as malignant PNSTs. In both NF1-associated and sporadic
  MPNSTs, the number of gains was higher than the number of losses, suggesting proto-oncogene
  activation during MPNST progression. NF1-asociated MPNSTs exhibited gains of chromosomes
  17q and X 2 4 cases each , whereas sporadic MPNSTs showed gains of chromosome 4q
  3 5 cases . On the other hand, in benign neurofibromas and schwannomas, the number
  of losses was higher than the number of gains, suggesting a predominant role of
  tumour suppressor genes in tumourigenesis. Both sporadic and NF1-associated neurofibromas
  exhibited losses at chromosome 22q in more than 50 of cases. These chromosomal regions
  may contain common chromosomal abnormalities characteristic of both types of neurofibromas.
  In NF1-associated neurofibromas, most frequent losses were found in chromosomes
  17 17p11.2-p13 in nine cases 60 17q24-25 in 6 cases 40 and 19 19p13.2 in eight cases
  53 19q13.2-qter in eight cases 53 , whereas in sporadic neurofibromas and schwannomas
  losses of chromosomes 17 and 19 were detected in less than 50 of cases. Since this
  17p11.2-p13 region is known to contain the tumour suppressor gene TP53, patients
  with NF1 may be at high risk of malignant neoplasms including MPNSTs. Gains were
  more frequently detected in plexiform neurofibromas 2 3 cases than other benign
  tumours, suggesting proto-oncogene activation in tumourigenesis of plexiform neurofibroma.
  The significance of the losses of chromosome 19 in these cases is not clear at present,
  but in NF1-associated neurofibromas, the presence of some as yet unknown tumour
  suppressor genes on chromosome 19 cannot be ruled out.
