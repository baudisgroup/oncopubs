abstract: We analyzed 19 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas by means of comparative
  genomic hybridization. Two tumors revealed no numerical abnormalities. In the remaining
  17 cases we found loss of entire chromosomes with underrepresentation of chromosome
  1 occurring in all 17 cases loss of chromosomes 2, 10, and 13 in 16 cases loss of
  chromosomes 6 and 21 in 15 tumors and loss of chromosome 17 in 13 cases. The loss
  of the Y chromosome was observed in 6 of 13 tumors from male patients, whereas 1
  X chromosome was lost in 3 of 4 tumors obtained from females. Comparative genomic
  hybridization results were verified by interphase cytogenetics. We conclude that
  a specific combination of multiple chromosomal losses characterizes chromophobe
  renal cell carcinomas and may help to differentiate them unequivocally from other
  types of kidney cancer.
