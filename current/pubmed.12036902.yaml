abstract: Sixteen dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcomas were analyzed by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to genomic microarrays matrix-CGH , cDNA-derived microarrays
  for expression profiling, and by quantitative PCR. Matrix-CGH revealed copy number
  gains of numerous oncogenes, i.e., CCND1, MDM2, GLI, CDK4, MYB, ESR1, and AIB1,
  several of which correlate with a high level of transcripts from the respective
  gene. In addition, a number of genes were found differentially expressed in dedifferentiated
  and pleomorphic liposarcomas. Application of dedicated clustering algorithms revealed
  that both tumor subtypes are clearly separated by the genomic profiles but only
  with a lesser power by the expression profiles. Using a support vector machine,
  a subset of five clones was identified as amp quot class discriminators. amp quot
  Thus, for the distinction of these types of liposarcomas, genomic profiling appears
  to be more advantageous than RNA expression analysis.
