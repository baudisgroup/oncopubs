abstract: Endometrial carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in women. A limited
  number of endometrial carcinoma cell lines are available for studies of signal transduction
  pathways and experimental therapeutics in vitro. However, these cell lines have
  not been comprehensively characterized. In this study, we used genome-wide microarray-based
  comparative genomic hybridization aCGH technology to characterize five of the more
  commonly used endometrial cancer cell lines. We detected DNA copy-number gains in
  chromosomal regions 2q, 3p, 3q, 5q, 7p, 17q, and 19q in all five cell lines. Other
  common sites of copy-number gains, which were detected in four of five cell lines,
  included segments of chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 16. In all five cell lines,
  we found DNA copy-number losses in regions 3p, 10p, 10q, 11q, 11p, 14q, 15q, 18p,
  and 21q. Other common sites of genetic aberrations included segments of chromosomes
  1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 16, 20, and 22. The genes involved in the copy-number alterations
  included the oncogenes PIK3CA 3q26.3 , K-ras 12p12.1 , R-ras 19q13.3-qter , Raf-1
  3p25 , EGFR 7p12 , Akt1 14q32.32 , and Akt2 19q13.1-q13.2 . A pathway analysis showed
  that genes in the PI3K and Wnt pathways are commonly affected. Our characterization
  of genomic alterations in these five commonly used endometrial cancer cell lines
  provides valuable genomic information for research that focuses on these key oncogenic
  pathways in endometrial cancer.
