abstract: Pancreatic cancer PC cell lines provide a useful starting point for the
  discovery and functional analysis of genes driving the genesis and progression of
  this lethal cancer. To increase our understanding of the gene copy number changes
  in pancreatic carcinomas and to identify key amplification and deletion targets,
  we applied genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization using in-house
  array MCG Cancer Array-800 to 24 PC cell lines. Overall, the analyses revealed high
  genomic complexity, with several copy number changes detected in each line. Homozygous
  deletions log 2 ratio amp lt -2 of eight genes clones were seen in 14 of the 24
  cell lines, whereas high-level amplifications log 2 ratio amp gt 2 of 10 genes clones
  were detected in seven lines. Among them, we focused on high-level amplification
  at 7q22.1, because target genes for this alteration remain unknown. Through precise
  mapping of the altered region by fluorescence in situ hybridization, determination
  of the expression status of genes located within those regions, and functional analysis
  using knockdown of the gene expression or the ectopic overexpression approach in
  PC cell lines, as well as immunohistochemical analyses of candidates in primary
  tumors of PC, we successfully identified SMURF1 as having the greatest potential
  as a 7q21.3-22.1 amplification target. SMURF1 may work as a growth-promoting gene
  in PC through overexpression and might be a good candidate as a therapeutic target.
  Our results suggest that array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis
  combined with further genetic and functional examinations is a useful approach for
  identifying novel tumor-associated genes involved in the pathogenesis of this lethal
  disease.
