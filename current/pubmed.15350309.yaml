abstract: There are very few studies reporting DNA copy number changes in fibroadenomas
  of the breast. Using comparative genomic hybridization, we analyzed 20 paraffin-embedded
  samples of fibroadenomas of the breast from patients with no familial or previous
  history of breast cancer. No alterations in the DNA copy number were observed in
  any of the tumors analyzed, regardless of the chromosomal alterations observed using
  conventional cytogenetic analysis. We discuss our results and compare them to other
  reports on fibroadenomas.
