abstract: Embryonal tumors with abundant neuropil and true rosettes ETANTR comprise
  a rare variant of embryonal brain tumors usually occurring in infants. Only 13 cases
  have been reported in the literature to date and little is known about the molecular
  pathogenesis of these tumors. Here, we describe a case of ETANTR in a 2-year-old
  girl presenting with a large tumor in the vermis of the cerebellum. Histological
  examination showed clusters of small-undifferentiated cells including ependymoblastic-like
  rosettes admixed with large fibrillar and paucicellular neuropil-like areas indicative
  for ETANTR. Genomic imbalances were detected by using array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization. In addition to trisomy of chromosome 2, which has been previously
  described in ETANTR, array-CGH revealed high-level genomic amplification of 0.89
  Mb at chromosome band 19q13.42 covering a microRNA cluster and several protein-coding
  genes. This aberration has not been described in any other brain tumor to date,
  indicating a specific aberration in ETANTR. MicroRNAs contained in the microRNA
  cluster at 19q13.42 including oncomirs miRNA-372 and miRNA-373 were highly up-regulated
  in the tumor when compared to normal cerebellum or whole brain. In summary, this
  is the first report on a potentially specific genetic aberration in ETANTR, supporting
  the hypothesis of a distinct tumor entity.
