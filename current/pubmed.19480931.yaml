abstract: Current cytogenetic techniques have enabled more accurate definition of
  genetic aberrations in the lymphoblasts of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  ALL , at least in most cases. Detecting the cryptic aberrations undetected by conventional
  cytogenetic methods is important for disease classification, evaluation of prognosis,
  and minimal residual disease follow-up. We have studied DNA copy number alterations
  of 27 adolescent ALL patients with normal n 26 or failed n 1 karyotype at diagnosis
  using microarray comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Aberrations were detected
  in 85 of cases, deletions being more frequent 39 in 19 patients than gains 14 in
  10 patients . Deletions of 9p21.3 were the most common aberration, and 41 of deletions
  were cryptic and amp lt 5 Mb in size. We conclude that ALL without any form of genetic
  alteration probably does not exist. Microarray CGH is a powerful tool to reveal
  otherwise cryptic aberrations in adolescent ALL.
