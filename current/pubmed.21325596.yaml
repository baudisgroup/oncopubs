abstract: Fanconi anemia FA is a genetic condition associated with bone marrow BM
  failure, myelodysplasia MDS , and acute myeloid leukemia AML . We studied 57 FA
  patients with hypoplastic or aplastic anemia n 20 , MDS n 18 , AML n 11 , or no
  BM abnormality n 8 . BM samples were analyzed by karyotype, high-density DNA arrays
  with respect to paired fibroblasts, and by selected oncogene sequencing. A specific
  pattern of chromosomal abnormalities was found in MDS AML, which included 1q 44.8
  , 3q 41.4 , -7 7q 17.2 , and 11q- 13.8 . Moreover, cryptic RUNX1 AML1 lesions translocations,
  deletions, or mutations were observed for the first time in FA 20.7 . Rare mutations
  of NRAS, FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD, ERG amplification, and ZFP36L2-PRDM16 translocation,
  but no TP53, TET2, CBL, NPM1, and CEBP mutations were found. Frequent homozygosity
  regions were related not to somatic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity but to consanguinity,
  suggesting that homologous recombination is not a common progression mechanism in
  FA. Importantly, the RUNX1 and other chromosomal genomic lesions were found at the
  MDS AML stages, except for 1q , which was found at all stages. These data have implications
  for staging and therapeutic managing in FA patients, and also to analyze the mechanisms
  of clonal evolution and oncogenesis in a background of genomic instability and BM
  failure.
