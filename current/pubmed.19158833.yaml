abstract: CD4 CD56 haematodermic neoplasms HDN constitute a rare disease characterized
  by aggressive clinical behaviour and a poor prognosis. Tumour cells from HDN are
  leukaemic counterparts of plasmacytoid dendritic cells pDCs . Despite increased
  knowledge of the ontogenetic origin of these tumours, the genetic causes and oncogenic
  signalling events involved in malignant transformation are still unknown. To delineate
  novel candidate regions and disease-related genes, we studied nine typical CD4 CD56
  HDN cases using genome-wide high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Genomic imbalances, which were predominantly losses, were frequently detected.
  Gross genomic losses or gains involving an entire chromosome were observed in eight
  cases. The most frequent imbalances were deletions of chromosome 9, chromosome 13
  and partial losses affecting 17p or 12p. Combinations of deletions of tumour suppressor
  genes TSG , namely RB1, CDKN1B p27 , CDKN2A, p16 ink4a , p14 arf or TP53 p53 , were
  observed in all cases. These results indicate that deletion events altering G1 S
  regulation are crucial for HDN oncogenesis. Furthermore, in addition to frequent
  sporadic gene losses, in one case we observed a 8q24 interstitial deletion that
  brought MYC closer to miR-30b miR-30d, which may be related to their deregulation.
  Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to frequent G1 S checkpoint
  alterations, various genetic events could contribute to the chemoresistance of the
  tumour.
