abstract: 'Numerous efforts have been made to elucidate the etiology and improve the
  treatment of lung cancer, but the overall five-year survival rate is still only
  15 . Identification of prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer using gene expression
  microarrays poses a major challenge in that very few overlapping genes have been
  reported among different studies. To address this issue, we have performed concurrent
  genome-wide analyses of copy number variation and gene expression to identify genes
  reproducibly associated with tumorigenesis and survival in non-smoking female lung
  adenocarcinoma. The genomic landscape of frequent copy number variable regions CNVRs
  in at least 30 of samples was revealed, and their aberration patterns were highly
  similar to several studies reported previously. Further statistical analysis for
  genes located in the CNVRs identified 475 genes differentially expressed between
  tumor and normal tissues p lt 10 -5 . We demonstrated the reproducibility of these
  genes in another lung cancer study p 0.0034, Fishers exact test , and showed the
  concordance between copy number variations and gene expression changes by elevated
  Pearson correlation coefficients. Pathway analysis revealed two major dysregulated
  functions in lung tumorigenesis: survival regulation via AKT signaling and cytoskeleton
  reorganization. Further validation of these enriched pathways using three independent
  cohorts demonstrated effective prediction of survival. In conclusion, by integrating
  gene expression profiles and copy number variations, we identified genes pathways
  that may serve as prognostic biomarkers for lung tumorigenesis.'
