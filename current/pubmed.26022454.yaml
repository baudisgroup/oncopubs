abstract: 'Solitary fibrous tumors, which are characterized by their broad morphological
  spectrum and unpredictable behavior, are rare mesenchymal neoplasias that are currently
  divided into three main variants that have the NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion as their unifying
  molecular lesion: usual, malignant and dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumors.
  The aims of this study were to validate molecular and immunohistochemical/biochemical
  approaches to diagnose the range of solitary fibrous tumors by focusing on the dedifferentiated
  variant, and to reveal the genetic events associated with dedifferentiation by integrating
  the findings of array comparative genomic hybridization. We studied 29 usual, malignant
  and dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumors from 24 patients (including paired
  samples from five patients whose tumors progressed to the dedifferentiated form)
  by means of STAT6 immunohistochemistry and (when frozen material was available)
  reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and biochemistry. In addition, the
  array comparative genomic hybridization findings were used to profile 12 tumors
  from nine patients. The NAB2/STAT6 fusion was detected in all of the tumors, but
  immunohistochemistry and western blotting indicated that chimeric protein expression
  was atypical or absent in 9 out of 11 dedifferentiated tumors. The comparative genomic
  hybridization results revealed that the usual and malignant solitary fibrous tumors
  had a simple profile, whereas the genome of the dedifferentiated tumors was complex
  and unstable, and suggested that 13q and 17p deletions and TP53 mutations may be
  present in malignant lesions before the full expression of a dedifferentiated phenotype.
  Solitary fibrous tumor dedifferentiation is associated with the loss of chimeric
  oncoprotein expression, genomic instability, and cell decommitment and reprogramming.
  The assessment of dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumors is based on the presence
  of the fusion transcripts and, in principle, negative STAT6 immunohistochemistry
  should not rule out a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor.Modern Pathology advance
