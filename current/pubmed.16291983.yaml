abstract: Exposure to ultraviolet light is a major causative factor in melanoma, although
  the relationship between risk and exposure is complex. We hypothesized that the
  clinical heterogeneity is explained by genetically distinct types of melanoma with
  different susceptibility to ultraviolet light.
