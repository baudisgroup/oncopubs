abstract: The research community at large is expending considerable resources to sequence
  the coding region of the genomes of tumors and other human diseases using targeted
  exome capture i.e., amp quot whole exome sequencing amp quot . The primary goal
  of targeted exome sequencing is to identify nonsynonymous mutations that potentially
  have functional consequences. Here, we demonstrate that whole-exome sequencing data
  can also be analyzed for comprehensively monitoring somatic copy number alterations
  CNAs by benchmarking the technique against conventional array CGH. A series of 17
  matched tumor and normal tissues from patients with metastatic castrate-resistant
  prostate cancer was used for this assessment. We show that targeted exome sequencing
  reliably identifies CNAs that are common in advanced prostate cancer, such as androgen
  receptor AR gain and PTEN loss. Taken together, these data suggest that targeted
  exome sequencing data can be effectively leveraged for the detection of somatic
  CNAs in cancer.
