abstract: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by the
  development of multiple neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules. Individuals
  with NF1 are at increased risk of developing various tumors, such as malignant peripheral
  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), pheochromocytoma, leukemia, glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
  and breast cancer. Here, we describe the exome sequencing of breast cancer, MPNST,
  and neurofibroma from a patient with NF1. We identified a germline mutation in the
  NF1 gene which resulted in conversion of leucine to proline at amino acid position
  847. In addition, we showed independent somatic NF1 mutations in all the three tumors
  (frameshift insertion in breast cancer (p.A985fs), missense mutation in MPNST (p.G23R),
  and inframe deletion in dermal neurofibroma (p.L1876del-Inf)), indicating that a
  second hit in NF1 resulting in the loss of function could be important for tumor
  formation. Each tumor had a distinct genomic profile with mutually exclusive mutations
  in different genes. Copy number analysis revealed multiple copy number alterations
  in the breast cancer and the MPNST, but not the benign neurofibroma. Germline loss
  of chromosome 6q22.33, which harbors two potential tumor suppressor genes, PTPRK
  and LAMA2, was also identified; this may increase tumor predisposition further.
  In the background of NF1 syndrome, although second-hit NF1 mutation is critical
  in tumorigenesis, different additional mutations are required to drive the formation
  of different tumors.  ï¿½ 2015 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley
