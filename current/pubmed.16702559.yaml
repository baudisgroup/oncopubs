abstract: We have previously identified a unique subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  ALL associated with a poor outcome and characterized by intrachromosomal amplification
  of chromosome 21 including the RUNX1 gene iAMP21 . In this study, array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH n 10 detected a common region of amplification CRA between
  33.192 and 39.796 Mb and a common region of deletion CRD between 43.7 and 47 Mb
  in 100 and 70 of iAMP21 patients, respectively. High-resolution genotypic analysis
  n 3 identified allelic imbalances in the CRA. Supervised gene expression analysis
  showed a distinct signature for eight patients with iAMP21, with 10 of overexpressed
  genes located within the CRA. The mean expression of these genes was significantly
  higher in iAMP21 when compared to other ALL samples n 45 . Although genomic copy
  number correlated with overall gene expression levels within areas of loss or gain,
  there was considerable individual variation. A unique subset of differentially expressed
  genes, outside the CRA and CRD, were identified when gene expression signatures
  of iAMP21 were compared to ALL samples with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion n 21 or high hyperdiploidy
  with additional chromosomes 21 n 23 . From this analysis, LGMN was shown to be overexpressed
  in patients with iAMP21 P 0.0012 . Genomic and expression data has further characterized
  this ALL subtype, demonstrating high levels of 21q instability in these patients
  leading to proposals for mechanisms underlying this clinical phenotype and plausible
  alternative treatments.
