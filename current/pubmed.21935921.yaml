abstract: The presence of disseminated tumor cells DTCs in bone marrow BM identifies
  breast cancer patients with less favorable outcome. Furthermore, molecular characterization
  is required to investigate the malignant potential of these cells. This study presents
  a single-cell array comparative genomic hybridization SCaCGH method providing molecular
  analysis of immunomorphologically detected DTCs. The resolution limit of the method
  was estimated using the cancer cell line SK-BR-3 on 44 and 244k arrays. The technique
  was further tested on 28 circulating tumor cells and four hematopoietic cells HCs
  from peripheral blood n 8 patients . The SCaCGH method was finally applied to 24
  DTCs, three immunopositive cells morphologically classified as probable HCs from
  breast cancer patients and five HC controls from BM n 7 patients plus n 1 healthy
  donor . The frequency of copy number changes of the DTCs revealed similarities with
  primary breast tumor samples. Three of the patients had available profiles for DTCs
  and the corresponding tumor tissue from primary surgery. More than two-third of
  the analyzed DTCs disclosed equivalent changes, both to each other and to the corresponding
  primary disease, whereas the rest of the cells showed balanced profiles. The probable
  HCs revealed either balanced profiles n 2 or changes comparable to the tumor tissue
  and DTCs n 1 , indicating morphological overlap between HCs and DTCs. Similar aberration
  patterns were visible in DTCs collected at diagnosis and at 3 years relapse-free
  follow-up. SCaCGH may be a powerful tool for the molecular characterization of DTCs.
