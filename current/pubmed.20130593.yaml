abstract: 'This study was undertaken to identify recurrent genetic alterations of
  the three main types of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas CTCLs : mycosis fungoides MF
  , Se zary syndrome SS , and cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma CALCL . Using
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization, the molecular cytogenetic profiles
  of 72 samples obtained from 58 patients with CTCL corresponding to 24 transformed
  MF T-MF , 16 SS, and 18 CALCLs were determined. T-MF was characterized by gains
  of 1q25 31, 7p22 11.2, 7q21, 7q31, and 17q12, and losses of 9p21, 10p11.2, and 10q26.
  SS exhibited gains of 8q23 24.3 and 17q23 24, as well as losses of 9p21, 10p12 11.2,
  10q22 24, 10q25 26, and 17p13 q11.1. Finally, CALCL exhibited 6q27 and 13q34 losses.
  Such imbalances were statistically associated with one CTCL subtype. Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering defined three categories of clinical relevance: 1 CALCL
  apart from epidermotropic-CTCL, 2 an SS-only category, and 3 a mixed category with
  T-MF and SS cases, with both primary and secondary SS cases. In rare cases, the
  genetic classification did not correspond to the inclusion diagnosis, possibly reflecting
  the association of two diseases in the same patient or initial misdiagnosis according
  to follow-up. Finally, different samples in the same patient clustered together,
  showing reproducibility of such a classifier.'
