abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck exhibit a highly variable picture
  of chromosomal aberrations. In the present study the clearly defined anatomical
  region of the tongue was analyzed for potentially specific patterns of chromosomal
  alterations. Fresh tumor samples from 18 patients afflicted by squamous cell carcinoma
  of the tongue constituted the clinical basis of the present investigation. The tumor
  samples were analyzed on the basis of comparative genomic hybridization CGH , a
  molecular cytogenetic FISH-approach. Gains in DNA copy numbers were detected as
  the predominant imbalance on chromosomes 7q 9 18 , 3q 48 18 , 16p 7 18 and 20q 7
  18 . The regions of minimal overlap on these chromosomes were mapped to 7q11.2q11.3
  and 3q26. A conspicuous finding was the frequent detection of amplifications in
  the 7q11 region. Gains in the 7q region have been rarely reported in CGH studies
  of tumors derived from different regions of the head and neck. Amplifications on
  7q could thus be specifically linked with the tongue region and could correlate
  with specific clinical factors of this tumor entity.
