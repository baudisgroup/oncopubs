abstract: Tumors with homologous recombination deficiency HRD , such as BRCA1-associated
  breast cancers, are not able to reliably repair DNA double-strand breaks DSBs and
  are therefore highly sensitive to both DSB-inducing chemotherapy and poly ADP-ribose
  polymerase inhibitors. We have studied markers that may indicate the presence of
  HRD in HER2-negative breast cancers and related them to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  response.
