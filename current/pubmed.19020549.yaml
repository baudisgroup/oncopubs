abstract: 'Merkel cell carcinoma MCC is an aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer with
  poorly characterized genetics. We performed high resolution comparative genomic
  hybridization on 25 MCC specimens using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray.
  Tumors frequently carried extra copies of chromosomes 1, 3q, 5p, and 6 and lost
  chromosomes 3p, 4, 5q, 7, 10, and 13. MCC tumors with less genomic aberration were
  associated with improved survival P 0.04 . Tumors from 13 of 22 MCC patients had
  detectable Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA, and these tumors had fewer genomic deletions.
  Three regions of genomic alteration were of particular interest: a deletion of 5q12-21
  occurred in 26 of tumors, a deletion of 13q14-21 was recurrent in 26 of tumors and
  contains the well-characterized tumor suppressor RB1, and a previously unreported
  focal amplification at 1p34 was present in 39 of tumors and centers on L-Myc MYCL1
  . L-Myc is related to the c-Myc proto-oncogene, has transforming activity, and is
  amplified in the closely related small cell lung cancer. Normal skin showed no L-Myc
  expression, whereas 4 4 MCC specimens tested expressed L-Myc RNA in relative proportion
  to the DNA copy number gain. These findings suggest several genes that may contribute
  to MCC pathogenesis, most notably L-Myc.'
