abstract: Early detection and treatment of non-invasive neoplasms can effectively
  reduce the incidence of advanced gastric carcinoma (GC), but only when the lineage
  is continuous between non-invasive and advanced tumours. Although a fraction of
  non-invasive neoplasms progress to invasive GC, it is difficult to identify individual
  progression-prone non-invasive neoplasms. To classify non-invasive gland-forming
  gastric neoplasms into clusters of different levels of progression risk, we applied
  mucin phenotyping and genomic DNA microarray analyses to intramucosal gland-forming
  gastric neoplasms.  Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 19 non-invasive
  and 24 invasive gland-forming neoplasms were obtained via endoscopic submucosal
  dissection or surgical excision. According to the Vienna classification, intramucosal
  neoplasms were classified as low-grade or high-grade non-invasive neoplasms (LGNs
  [category 3] and HGNs [category 4], respectively) or invasive carcinomas (intramucosal
  GCs and mucosal parts of submucosal or deeper GCs [category 5]). Neoplastic lesions
  were characterized by mucin phenotypes determined using monoclonal antibodies against
  MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and CD10. Genomic DNA samples from mucosal neoplasms were subjected
  to array-based comparative genomic hybridization and subsequent unsupervised, hierarchical
  clustering with selected large-sized genes.  There was no significant difference
  in mucin phenotype between HGNs/LGNs and invasive carcinomas. The clustering classified
  samples into stable, unstable, and intermediate. The histological tumour grade or
  mucin phenotype of non-invasive neoplasms did not correlate with the clustering
  results. Each cluster may represent an independent lineage of different outcome
  because the size distribution of non-invasive tumours among the 3 clusters almost
  overlapped. In contrast, the unstable cluster alone included invasive carcinomas.  These
  findings suggest that the outcome of individual tumours is not stochastically determined
  but can be predicted from the genomic copy-number profile even at the non-invasive
  stage. Non-invasive neoplasms of the unstable clusters, which accounted for 21%
  of non-invasive neoplasms, may progress to invasive carcinomas, whereas those of
  stable cluster may not.
