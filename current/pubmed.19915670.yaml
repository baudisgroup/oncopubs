abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme GBM is an umbrella designation that includes a heterogeneous
  group of primary brain tumors. Several classification strategies of GBM have been
  reported, some by clinical course and others by resemblance to cell types either
  in the adult or during development. From a practical and therapeutic standpoint,
  classifying GBMs by signal transduction pathway activation and by mutation in pathway
  member genes may be particularly valuable for the development of targeted therapies.
