abstract: The myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of hematologic disorders that
  often evolve into secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The genetic changes that
  underlie progression from the myelodysplastic syndromes to secondary AML are not
  well understood.  We performed whole-genome sequencing of seven paired samples of
  skin and bone marrow in seven subjects with secondary AML to identify somatic mutations
  specific to secondary AML. We then genotyped a bone marrow sample obtained during
  the antecedent myelodysplastic-syndrome stage from each subject to determine the
  presence or absence of the specific somatic mutations. We identified recurrent mutations
  in coding genes and defined the clonal architecture of each pair of samples from
  the myelodysplastic-syndrome stage and the secondary-AML stage, using the allele
  burden of hundreds of mutations.  Approximately 85% of bone marrow cells were clonal
  in the myelodysplastic-syndrome and secondary-AML samples, regardless of the myeloblast
  count. The secondary-AML samples contained mutations in 11 recurrently mutated genes,
  including 4 genes that have not been previously implicated in the myelodysplastic
  syndromes or AML. In every case, progression to acute leukemia was defined by the
  persistence of an antecedent founding clone containing 182 to 660 somatic mutations
  and the outgrowth or emergence of at least one subclone, harboring dozens to hundreds
  of new mutations. All founding clones and subclones contained at least one mutation
  in a coding gene.  Nearly all the bone marrow cells in patients with myelodysplastic
  syndromes and secondary AML are clonally derived. Genetic evolution of secondary
  AML is a dynamic process shaped by multiple cycles of mutation acquisition and clonal
  selection. Recurrent gene mutations are found in both founding clones and daughter
  subclones. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).
