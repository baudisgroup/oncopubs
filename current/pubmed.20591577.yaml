abstract: Astrocytic tumors are the most frequent primary brain neoplasms. They are
  clinically characterized by wide variations in histology. Analysis of chromosome
  DNA imbalance may help to advance diagnosis, grading, and classification, and to
  determine appropriate therapeutic approaches for tumors of astrocytic lineages.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH provides comprehensive information about chromosome
  DNA aberrations, and is an important technique for evaluating the differences at
  genomic levels among the same or different grade tumors. In this study, 63 astrocytic
  tumors of Chinese patients were screened by CGH, and the relationship between their
  chromosome DNA imbalances and the histopathological classification, grading, and
  clinical features was analyzed. Most tumors showed genomic copy aberrations detected
  by CGH. The most frequent abnormalities were regional gains in chromosome 1q and
  7p regional losses in chromosome 1p, 2q, 4q, 6p, 10q, 12q, 15q, 19q, and 22q were
  also frequently observed. The gain of 1q and the loss of 15q were relevant to the
  histological types and grades of WHO classification. The losses of 4q and 10q correlated
  with age in the group of anaplastic astrocytoma, which was unreported in the literature.
  This study confirmed that chromosomal aberrations, such as 1q, -4q, -10q, 7p, and
  -15q possibly contributed to the pathogenesis of these tumors. Our data was the
  first report on the chromosomal aberrations of astrocytic tumors of Chinese patients.
