abstract: Cyclin D1 - mantle cell lymphomas MCLs are not well characterized, in part
  because of the difficulties in their recognition. SOX11 has been identified recently
  as a reliable biomarker of MCL that is also expressed in the cyclin D1 - variant.
  We investigated 40 lymphomas with MCL morphology and immunophenotype that were negative
  for cyclin D1 expression t 11 14 q13 q32 but positive for SOX11. These tumors presented
  clinically with generalized lymphadenopathy, advanced stage, and poor outcome 5-year
  overall survival, 48 . Chromosomal rearrangements of the CCND2 locus were detected
  in 55 of the cases, with an IG gene as partner in 18 of 22, in particular with light
  chains 10 IGK and 5 IGL . No mutations in the phosphorylation motifs of CCND1, CCND2,
  or CCND3 were detected. The global genomic profile and the high complexity of the
  32 cyclin D1 - SOX11 MCL patients analyzed by copy number arrays were similar to
  the conventional cyclin D1 SOX11 MCL. 17p deletions and high Ki67 expression conferred
  a significantly worse outcome for the patients. This comprehensive characterization
  of a large series of cyclin D1 - MCL patients indicates that these tumors are clinically
  and biologically similar to the conventional cyclin D1 MCL and provides a basis
  for the proper identification and clinical management of these patients.
