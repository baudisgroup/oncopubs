abstract: The worldwide incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is approximately
  one million cases a year. This makes HCC one of the most frequent human malignancies,
  especially in Asia and Africa, although the incidence is increasing also in the
  western world. HCC is a complication of chronic liver disease, with cirrhosis as
  the most important risk factor. Viral co-pathogenesis makes cirrhosis due to hepatitis
  B HBV and hepatitis C virus HCV infection a very important factor in the development
  of HCC. As curative therapy is often ruled out due to the late detection of HCC,
  it would be attractive to find parameters which predict malignant transformation
  in HBV- and HCV-infected livers. This study has used comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to analyse 26 HCCs 11 non-viral, nine HBV, six HCV and 12 concurrent dysplasias
  five non-viral, five HBV, two HCV . Frequent gain amp gt or 25 of all tumours was
  detected, in decreasing order of frequency, on 8q 69 , 1q 46 , 17q 46 , 12q 42 ,
  20q 31 , 5p 27 , 6q 27 , and Xq 27 . Frequent loss amp gt or 25 of all tumours was
  found, in decreasing order of frequency, on 8p 58 , 16q 54 , 4q 42 , 13q 39 , 1p
  35 , 4p 35 , 16p 35 , 18q 35 , 14q 31 , 17p 31 , 9p 27 , and 9q 27 . Minimal overlapping
  regions could be determined at multiple locations candidate genes in parentheses
  . Minimal regions of overlap for deletions were assigned to 4p14-15 PCDH7 , 8p21-22
  FEZ1 , 9p12-13, 13q14-31 RB1 , 14q31 TSHR , 16p12-13.1 GSPT1 , 16q21-23 CDH1 , 17p12-13
  TP53 , and 18q21-22 DPC4, DCC . Minimal overlapping amplified sites could be seen
  at 8q24 MYC , 12q15-21 MDM2 , 17q22-25 SSTR2, GH1 , and 20q12-13.2 MYBL2, PTPN1
  . A single high level amplification was seen on 5q21 in an HBV-related tumour. Aberrations
  appeared more frequent in HBV-related HCCs than in HCV-associated tumours p 0.008
  . This was most prominent with respect to losses p 0.004 , specifically loss on
  4p p 0.007 , 16q p 0.04 , 17p p 0.04 , and 18q p 0.03 . In addition, loss on 17p
  was significantly lower in non-viral cancers than in HBV-related HCC p amp lt 0.001
  . Furthermore, loss on 13q was more prevalent in HCCs in non-cirrhotic livers p
  0.02 , thus suggesting a different, potentially more aggressive, pathway in neoplastic
  progression. A tendency p 0.07 was observed for loss on 9q in high-stage tumours
  no specific changes were found in relation to tumour grade. A subset of the HCC-associated
  genetic changes was disclosed in the preneoplastic stage, i.e. liver cell dysplasia.
  This group of dysplasias showed frequent gain on 17q 25 and frequent loss on 16q
  33 , 4q 25 , and 17p 25 . The majority of the dysplasias with alterations revealed
  genetic changes that were also present in the primary tumour. In conclusion, firstly,
  this study has provided a detailed map of genomic changes occurring in HCC of viral
  and non-viral origin, and has suggested candidate genes. Loss on 17p, including
  the TP53 region, appeared significantly more prevalent in HBV-associated liver cancers,
  whereas loss on 13q, with possible involvement of RB1, was distinguished as a possible
  genetic biomarker. Secondly, CGH analysis of liver cell dysplasia, both viral and
  non-viral, has revealed HCC-specific early genetic changes, thereby confirming its
  preneoplastic nature. Finally, genes residing in these early altered regions, such
  as CDH1 or TP53, might be associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
