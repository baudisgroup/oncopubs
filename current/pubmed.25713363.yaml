abstract: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is incurable with conventional therapies and has
  a clinical course typified by multiple relapses after therapy. These tumors are
  genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and
  mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor
  cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations
  of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96% of FL tumors and two or more
  in 76% of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor
  evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across
  the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among
  all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched
  within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a
  signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript
  and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of
  CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation
  of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in
  vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures
  of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this
  corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and
  CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation
  as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased
  antigen presentation.
