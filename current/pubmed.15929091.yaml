abstract: 'Genomic alterations influencing the expression and or activity of tumor
  suppressors or oncogenes such as KRAS2, CDKN2A, TP53, and DPC4 have been directly
  implicated in the initiation and progression of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
  In an effort further to systematically characterize the genomic alterations that
  occur in this disease, we conducted a genome wide analysis of alterations in gene
  copy number using array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH . For this analysis,
  we utilized a panel of 25 human pancreatic cancer cell lines derived from either
  primary or metastatic tumors. This panel also included a metastatic progression
  series of cell lines derived from COLO 357 cells. Array CGH permitted the identification
  of alterations in the copy number of genes that might participate in the aberrant
  behavior of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the acquisition of invasive and
  metastatic potential by derivatives of COLO 357 cells was accompanied by additional
  focal genomic alterations including point mutations and amplification of KRAS2.
  To complement the array CGH analysis, we also conducted an analysis of mRNA expression
  patterns in a subset of these cells using cDNA microarrays. By this means, we identified
  a set of candidate genes, including those regulated by RAS signaling, that may contribute
  to the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Supplementary material for
