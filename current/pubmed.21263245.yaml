abstract: Atypical Spitz tumors ASTs are rare spitzoid neoplasms of uncertain biological
  behavior. Our study was designed to characterize genetic abnormalities that may
  help to differentiate ASTs from melanoma or Spitz nevi. We examined copy number
  variation in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples using an Agilent 44k array
  comparative genomic hybridization platform. Sixteen patients with AST 8 with positive
  sentinel lymph node biopsy, 1 with distant metastasis , 8 patients with Spitz nevi,
  and 3 patients with melanoma 2 spitzoid, 1 superficial spreading were evaluated.
  Chromosomal aberrations were found in 7 of 16 ASTs, 1 with fatal outcome, 2 spitzoid
  melanomas, and 1 conventional melanoma. We found no difference in chromosomal instability
  between AST patients with positive and negative sentinel lymph node biopsies. Our
  patient with widely metastatic AST lacked the most frequent aberrations in melanoma
  involving chromosomes 6 and 11q that are loci targeted by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH probes developed to distinguish malignant melanoma from benign melanocytic
  lesions. The vast majority of chromosomal abnormalities observed in ASTs are not
  commonly found in melanomas, suggesting that AST may be a distinct clinical entity
  and raising additional questions regarding their malignant potential, prognosis,
  and clinical management. The current FISH probes failed to detect 1 spitzoid melanoma,
  1 fatal metastatic AST case, and the other chromosomally aberrant ASTs in our series,
  but detected 1 spitzoid melanoma and 1 conventional melanoma. Thus, a comprehensive,
  genome-wide approach to chromosomal abnormalities offered greater sensitivity and
  specificity than current FISH probes in identifying spitzoid lesions of uncertain
  malignant potential in this series.
