abstract: In this study we have applied the technique of comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to a large series of sporadic Wilms tumors, including six samples of the associated
  nephroblastomatosis. The data obtained were compared with the findings of molecular
  studies carried out on the same material. The aims of the study were 1 to characterize
  the range of genetic variation in sporadic Wilms tumor and nephroblastomatosis,
  2 to determine whether changes could be found that have not been detected by commonly
  used techniques, and 3 to compare the sensitivity of CGH with that of conventional
  molecular analysis. The chromosomes that showed gains and losses by CGH were similar
  to those previously found in molecular and cytogenetic studies, however loss of
  4q was a new event identified in 2 out of 46 tumors. We did not detect amplified
  genetic material. Comparison of the data from the nephroblastomatosis and tumor
  samples from the same patient showed that loss of 7p may be associated with malignant
  transformation, and that losses in 1p, 11p, 4q and gains in 1q and 12q can be early
  events whilst loss in 9p and gain of 8, 10q and 18 are possible secondary changes
  in tumor development. The combined CGH and molecular techniques used demonstrated
  involvement of two specific 1p regions in the etiology of Wilms tumor.
