abstract: Serous carcinomas of the fallopian tube, uterus, and ovary resemble each
  other both histologically and in clinical behavior. Comparative genomic hybridization
  was performed on 20 primary fallopian tube carcinoma specimens to find regions of
  the genome involved in tubal carcinogenesis and to compare the genomic alterations
  with those previously detected in serous ovarian and uterine carcinomas. The most
  frequent changes detected in fallopian tube carcinoma were gains at 3q 70 and 8q
  75 , with high-level amplifications in several cases. Other common gains occurred
  at 1q, 5p, 7q, 12p, and 20q. The most frequent losses were found at 18q, 8p, 4q,
  and 5q. The frequency and the pattern of chromosomal changes detected in tubal carcinoma
  were strikingly similar to those observed in serous ovarian and uterine carcinomas,
  suggesting common molecular pathogenesis.
