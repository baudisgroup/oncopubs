abstract: 'Meningiomas were among the first solid tumors recognized as having cytogenetic
  alterations. The most consistent changes reported in grade I meningiomas were monosomy
  22 or partial 22q deletion. The vast majority of meningiomas are histologically
  benign, but the prognosis is determined by risk of recurrence after surgical treatment.
  Despite important advances in the identification of prognostic factors in the past
  decade, the exact nature of tumor recurrence remains largely unknown. In the present
  study, a recurrent transitional meningioma deriving from the anterior portion of
  the falx cerebri was characterized by combining conventional cytogenetics and array
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis revealed
  the following complex numerical and structural aberrations: 42,XY,der 1 t 1 p12
  ,-6,der 12 15 q10 q10 ,-18, -22. Additional clonal evolutions were further identified
  with disease relapse. Array CGH corroborated the cytogenetic findings. The presence
  of a complex cytogenetic profile and progression-associated chromosomal abnormalities
  in a benign meningioma suggests the existence of underlying molecular events.'
