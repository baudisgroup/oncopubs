abstract: To investigate genetic alterations in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas
  PCBCLs , we have analyzed 29 cases of PCBCL. Comparative genomic hybridization showed
  chromosome imbalances CIs in 12 cases 41 . The mean number of CIs per sample was
  2.05 - 2.97, with gains 1.48 - 2.38 more frequent than losses 0.56 - 1.40 . The
  common regions of gains were 18 18q 50 , 7 7p 42 , 3 3q 33 , 20 33 , 1p 25 , 12
  12q 25 , and 13 13q 25 , whereas loss of 6q was frequent 42 . Among the different
  subsets of PCBCLs, CI was seen in 50 of diffuse large-cell lymphomas DLCLs , 33
  of marginal zone lymphomas, and 8 of follicle center cell lymphomas and unclassified
  lymphomas. A similar pattern of CI was observed in these lymphomas, but loss of
  6q and gains of 3 3q were present only in DLCLs. Microarray-based genomic analysis
  of four DLCL cases identified oncogene gains of SAS CDK4 12q13.3 in three cases
  and MYCL1 1p34.3 , MYC 8q24 , FGFR2 10q26 , BCL2 18q21.3 , CSE1L 20q13 , and PDGFB
  22q12-13 in two cases, whereas losses of AKT1 14q32.3 , IGFR1 15q25-26 , and JUNB
  19p13.2 were identified in three cases, and losses of FGR 1p36 , ESR 6q25.1 , ABL1
  9q34.1 , TOP2A 17q21-22 , ERBB2 17q21.2 , CCNE1 19q13.1 , and BCR 22q11 were each
  identified in two cases. In addition, real-time-polymerase chain reaction detected
  amplification of BCL2 in 5 of 29 cases. These findings suggest that there are complex
  but consistent genetic alterations associated with the pathogenesis of PCBCLs.
