abstract: Keratoacanthoma KA is a benign keratinocytic neoplasm that usually presents
  as a solitary nodule on sun-exposed areas, develops within 6-8 weeks and spontaneously
  regresses after 3-6 months. KAs share features such as infiltration and cytological
  atypia with squamous cell carcinomas SCCs . Furthermore, there are reports of KAs
  that have metastasized, invoking the question of whether or not KA is a variant
  of SCC. To date no reported criteria are sensitive enough to discriminate reliably
  between KA and SCC, and consequently there is a clinical need for discriminating
  markers. We screened fresh frozen material from 132 KAs and 37 SCCs for gross chromosomal
  aberrations by using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Forty-nine KAs 37.1
  and 31 SCCs 83.7 showed genomic aberrations, indicating a higher degree of chromosomal
  instability in SCCs. Gains of chromosomal material from 1p, 14q, 16q, 20q, and losses
  from 4p were seen significantly more frequently in SCCs compared with KAs P-values
  0.0033, 0.0198, 0.0301, 0.0017, and 0.0070 , whereas loss from 9p was seen significantly
  more frequently in KAs P-value 0.0434 . The patterns of recurrent aberrations were
  also different in the two types of neoplasms, pointing to different genetic mechanisms
  involved in their developments.
