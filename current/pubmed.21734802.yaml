abstract: 'AIM:To identify molecular markers shared across South African esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma ESCC cell lines using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH and single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array copy number analysis.METHODS:We
  used conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and multicolor FISH to characterize the chromosomal
  rearrangements of five ESCC cell lines established in South Africa. The whole genome
  copy number profile was established from 250K SNP arrays, and data was analyzed
  with the CNAT 4.0 and GISTIC software.RESULTS:We detected common translocation breakpoints
  involving chromosomes 1p11-12 and 3p11.2, the latter correlated with the deletion,
  or interruption of the EPHA3 gene. The most significant amplifications involved
  the following chromosomal regions and genes: 11q13.3 CCND1, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MYEOV
  , 8q24.21 C-MYC, FAM84B , 11q22.1-q22.3 BIRC2, BIRC3 , 5p15.2 CTNND2 , 3q11.2-q12.2
  MINA and 18p11.32 TYMS, YES1 . The significant deletions included 1p31.2-p31.1 CTH,
  GADD45 , DIRAS3 , 2q22.1 LRP1B , 3p12.1-p14.2 FHIT , 4q22.1-q32.1 CASP6, SMAD1 ,
  8p23.2-q11.1 BNIP3L and 18q21.1-q21.2 SMAD4, DCC . The 3p11.2 translocation breakpoint
  was shared across four cell lines, supporting a role for genes involved at this
  site, in particular, the EPHA3 gene which has previously been reported to be deleted
  in ESCC.CONCLUSION:The finding that a significant number of genes that were amplified
  FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, CCND1 and C-MYC or deleted SFRP2 gene are involved in the Wnt
  and fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways, suggests that these pathways may
  be activated in these cell lines.'
