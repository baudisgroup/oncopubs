abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays SNP-As have emerged as an important
  tool in the identification of chromosomal defects undetected by metaphase cytogenetics
  MC in hematologic cancers, offering superior resolution of unbalanced chromosomal
  defects and acquired copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. Myelodysplastic syndromes
  MDSs and related cancers share recurrent chromosomal defects and molecular lesions
  that predict outcomes. We hypothesized that combining SNP-A and MC could improve
  diagnosis prognosis and further the molecular characterization of myeloid malignancies.
  We analyzed MC SNP-A results from 430 patients MDS 250, MDS myeloproliferative overlap
  neoplasm 95, acute myeloid leukemia from MDS 85 . The frequency and clinical significance
  of genomic aberrations was compared between MC and MC plus SNP-A. Combined MC SNP-A
  karyotyping lead to higher diagnostic yield of chromosomal defects 74 vs 44 , P
  amp lt .0001 , compared with MC alone, often through detection of novel lesions
  in patients with normal noninformative 54 and abnormal 62 MC results. Newly detected
  SNP-A defects contributed to poorer prognosis for patients stratified by current
  morphologic and clinical risk schemes. The presence and number of new SNP-A detected
  lesions are independent predictors of overall and event-free survival. The significant
  diagnostic and prognostic contributions of SNP-A-detected defects in MDS and related
  diseases underscore the utility of SNP-A when combined with MC in hematologic malignancies.
