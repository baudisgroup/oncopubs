abstract: 'Small cell carcinomas SCCs represent a rare histological subtype of urinary
  bladder cancer. Little is known abut the genetic alterations in these tumours. To
  identify chromosomal aberrations that are typically present in SCC of the urinary
  bladder, ten tumours were analysed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . CGH
  allows screening for all relative DNA copy number gains and losses present in a
  tumour. SCCs of the bladder were characterized by a high number of genomic alterations
  mean: 11.3 per tumour . Deletions were most frequent at 10q 7 of 10 tumours deleted
  , 4q, 5q 5 10 each , and 13q 4 10 . These regions may carry tumour suppressor genes
  with relevance for this particular tumour type. Gains of DNA sequences were most
  prevalent at 8q 5 10 , 5p, 6p, and 20q 4 10 each . High level amplifications were
  found at 1p22-32, 3q26.3, 8q24, and 12q14-21. These loci may pinpoint the localization
  of oncogenes with relevance for small cell bladder cancer. The analysis of one tumour
  having areas of both SCC and transitional cell carcinoma strongly suggests that
  SCC can develop from TCC through the acquisition of additional genetic alterations.'
