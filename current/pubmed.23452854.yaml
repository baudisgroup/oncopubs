abstract: 'Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor. Although
  current therapies improve survival, these regimens are highly toxic and are associated
  with significant morbidity. Here, we report that placental growth factor PlGF is
  expressed in the majority of medulloblastomas, independent of their subtype. Moreover,
  high expression of PlGF receptor neuropilin 1 Nrp1 correlates with poor overall
  survival in patients. We demonstrate that PlGF and Nrp1 are required for the growth
  and spread of medulloblastoma: PlGF Nrp1 blockade results in direct antitumor effects
  in vivo, resulting in medulloblastoma regression, decreased metastasis, and increased
  mouse survival. We reveal that PlGF is produced in the cerebellar stroma via tumor-derived
  Sonic hedgehog Shh and show that PlGF acts through Nrp1-and not vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor 1-to promote tumor cell survival. This critical tumor-stroma
  interaction-mediated by Shh, PlGF, and Nrp1 across medulloblastoma subtypes-supports
  the development of therapies targeting PlGF Nrp1 pathway.'
