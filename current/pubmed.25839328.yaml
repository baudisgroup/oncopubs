abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers
  worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. However, although genomic
  studies have identified some mutations associated with ESCC, we know little of the
  mutational processes responsible. To identify genome-wide mutational signatures,
  we performed either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES)
  on 104 ESCC individuals and combined our data with those of 88 previously reported
  samples. An APOBEC-mediated mutational signature in 47% of 192 tumors suggests that
  APOBEC-catalyzed deamination provides a source of DNA damage in ESCC. Moreover,
  PIK3CA hotspot mutations (c.1624G>A [p.Glu542Lys] and c.1633G>A [p.Glu545Lys]) were
  enriched in APOBEC-signature tumors, and no smoking-associated signature was observed
  in ESCC. In the samples analyzed by WGS, we identified focal (<100 kb) amplifications
  of CBX4 and CBX8. In our combined cohort, we identified frequent inactivating mutations
  in AJUBA, ZNF750, and PTCH1 and the chromatin-remodeling genes CREBBP and BAP1,
  in addition to known mutations. Functional analyses suggest roles for several genes
  (CBX4, CBX8, AJUBA, and ZNF750) in ESCC. Notably, high activity of hedgehog signaling
  and the PI3K pathway in approximately 60% of 104 ESCC tumors indicatesï¿½that therapies
  targeting these pathways might be particularly promising strategies for ESCC. Collectively,
  our data provide comprehensive insights into the mutational signatures of ESCC and
  identify markers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets.  Copyright
