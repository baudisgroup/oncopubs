abstract: We examined a large number of primary high-grade neuroendocrine tumors of
  the lung 10 small cell lung carcinomas and 31 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas
  by using array-based comparative genomic hybridization using microarrays spotted
  with 800 bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing tumor-related genes from
  throughout the human genome. We identified the genome-wide copy number alteration
  profiles of these tumors, including recurrent amplifications located at 2q21.2,
  3q21-27, 3q26, 3q27-29, 5p14.2, 5p13, 7q21.1, 8q21, and 8q24 and homozygous deletions
  at 1p36, 4p16, 4p16.3, 9p21.3, 9p21, 19p13.3, and 20q13. Our results revealed that
  small cell lung carcinomas and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas have multiple
  characteristic chromosomal alterations in common, but that distinctive alterations
  also exist between the two subtypes. Moreover, we found that the two subtypes undergo
  different processes of accumulating these genetic alterations during tumor development.
  By comparing the genetic profiles with the clinicopathological features, we discovered
  many chromosomal loci whose alterations were significantly associated with clinical
  stage and patient prognosis. These results will be valuable for evaluating clinical
  status, including patient prognosis, and for identifying novel molecular targets
  for effective therapies.
