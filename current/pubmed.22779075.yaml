abstract: Chromosomes forming a corresponding ring cannot be clearly defined by conventional
  cytogenetics or FISH. Karyotypic analyses using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism
  arrays SNP-A may result in the identification of previously cryptic lesions and
  allow for more precise definition of breakpoints. We describe a case of AML with
  metaphase cells bearing -5, del 11 q22 , and r. With SNP-A, a 5p-terminal deletion
  11 megabases Mb , a 5q-terminal deletion 27 Mb , an 11q-interstitial deletion 29
  Mb , and a 21q gain 3 Mb were identified. Therefore, the G-banded karyotype was
  revised as 46, XY, r 5 p15. 2q33.2 , del 11 q14.1q23.2 , dup 21 q22.13q22.2 18 46,XY
  2 . SNP-A could be a powerful tool for characterizing ring chromosomes in which
  the involved chromosomes or bands cannot be precisely identified by conventional
  cytogenetics or FISH.
