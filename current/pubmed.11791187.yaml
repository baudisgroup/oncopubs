abstract: The small intestinal mucosa makes up about 90 of the total surface of the
  gastrointestinal tract. However, adenocarcinomas arise rarely in this location.
  To elucidate genetic alterations underlying tumour development in the small intestine
  we investigated 17 sporadic adenocarcinomas. By comparative genomic hybridization
  recurrent gains of chromosomal material were found at chromosomes 7, 8, 13q, and
  20 5 17, each , while non-random losses were seen at 8p, 17p 4 17, each , and 18
  8 17 cases . Deletions at 5q, the location of the APC tumour suppressor gene, were
  seen in three cases. Microsatellite analysis with markers on chromosomal arms 1p,
  5q, 8p, 17p, 18q, 19p, and 22q revealed a microsatellite instable phenotype in two
  cases and a high frequency of loss at 18q21-q22 80 . Given the high incidence of
  18q21-q22 deletions, we performed sequencing analysis of SMAD4, a downstream component
  of the TGFbeta-pathway, located at 18q21. Four tumours displayed mutations in highly
  conserved domains of the gene indicating disruption of TGFbeta-signalling. Our data
  reveal complex genetic alterations in sporadic small intestinal carcinomas. However,
  most tumours share deletions of 18q21-q22, which frequently target SMAD4. This indicates
  that disruption of TGFbeta-signalling plays a critical role in small intestinal
  tumorigenesis.
