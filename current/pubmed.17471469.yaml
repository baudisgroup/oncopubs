abstract: 'Total mesorectal excision TME is the standard treatment for rectal cancer,
  while transanal endoscopic microsurgery TEM is a recently introduced surgical approach
  for the treatment of rectal adenomas. Incorrect preoperative staging before TEM
  is a problem. To identify genetic changes that might correlate with tumour stage
  and could lead to optimized treatment selection we performed a genome-wide chromosomal
  instability search in a homogeneous, clinical cohort of rectal tumours. 78 rectal
  tumours during different clinical stages were analysed with 10K single nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP arrays. Logistic regression was performed to build a quantitative
  model of specific chromosomal aberrations. Overall, most cases 95 had one or more
  chromosomal aberrations. We observed a clear correlation between the total number
  of aberrations and the different tumour stages. Specifically, the chromosomal events:
  gain of 8q22-24, 13q and 20q, and loss of 17p and 18q12-22, were far more abundant
  in carcinoma than in adenoma. In adenoma fractions from cases with a carcinoma infiltrating
  at least in the submucosa , twice the amount of such malignant aberrations was observed,
  compared to pure adenomas. Furthermore, combined aberrations such as gain of 13q
  and loss of 18q were only found in adenomatous fractions of carcinomas and not in
  benign lesions. Based on these five genomic events associated with carcinoma, a
  clear distinction between adenoma and carcinoma tissue could be made. These data
  should be validated further in order that they may be used in preoperative staging
  of rectal tumours.'
