abstract: Osteosarcoma OS is a highly malignant bone neoplasm of children and young
  adults. It is characterized by chaotic karyotypes with complex marker chromosomes.
  We applied a combination of molecular cytogenetic techniques including comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , spectral karyotyping SKY , and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH to decipher the chromosomal complexity in a panel of 25 tumors.
  Combined SKY and G-banding analysis identified several novel recurrent breakpoint
  clusters and 9 nonrecurrent reciprocal translocations. CGH identified several recurrent
  chromosomal losses including 2q, 3p, 9, 10p, 12q, 13q, 14q, 15q, 16, 17p, and 18q,
  gains including Xp, Xq, 5q, 6p, 8q, 17p, and 20q, and high-level chromosomal amplifications
  at Xp11.2, 1q21-q22, 4p11, 4q12, 5p15, 6p12.1, 8q13, 8q23, 10q11, 10q22, 11q13,
  11q23, 12q13-q14, 13q21-q34, 16q22, 17p11.2, 17q21-q22, 18q22, 20p11.2, and 20q12.
  Frequent amplification and rearrangement involving chromosomal bands at 6p12-p21
  and 17p11.2 were found in 28 and 32 of cases, respectively. In an attempt to identify
  the genes involved in these amplicons, we used three nonoverlapping BAC clones contained
  within each amplicon as probes for FISH analysis, leading to a more detailed characterization
  and quantification of the 6p and 17p amplicons.
