abstract: Prostate cancer-associated stroma (CAS) plays an active role in malignant
  transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Molecular analyses of CAS have
  demonstrated significant changes in gene expression; however, conflicting evidence
  exists on whether genomic alterations in benign cells comprising the tumor microenvironment
  (TME) underlie gene expression changes and oncogenic phenotypes. This study evaluates
  the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA integrity of prostate carcinoma cells, CAS, matched
  benign epithelium and benign epithelium-associated stroma by whole genome copy number
  analyses, targeted sequencing of TP53, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) of CAS revealed a copy-neutral diploid genome with
  only rare and small somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs). In contrast, several
  expected recurrent SCNAs were evident in the adjacent prostate carcinoma cells,
  including gains at 3q, 7p, and 8q, and losses at 8p and 10q. No somatic TP53 mutations
  were observed in CAS. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extracted from carcinoma cells and
  stroma identified 23 somatic mtDNA mutations in neoplastic epithelial cells but
  only one mutation in stroma. Finally, genomic analyses identified no SCNAs, no loss
  of heterozygosity (LOH) or copy-neutral LOH in cultured cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs), which are known to promote prostate cancer progression in vivo.  The gene
  expression changes observed in prostate cancer-adjacent stroma and the attendant
  contribution of the stroma to the development and progression of prostate cancer
  are not due to frequent or recurrent genomic alterations in the tumor microenvironment.  Copyright
