abstract: The introduction of the bowel cancer screening programme has resulted in
  increasing numbers of patients being diagnosed with node-negative disease. Unfortunately,
  approximately 30 will develop recurrence following surgery. Given the toxicity associated
  with adjuvant chemotherapy, it is important to identify high-risk patients who may
  benefit from adjuvant therapy. This study aims to identify which clinicopathological
  factors and genetic profiling markers predict outcome in node-negative disease.
