abstract: The relationship of apocrine metaplasia to invasive breast cancer is controversial.
  Different authors have reported that apocrine differentiation in proliferative lesions
  may be a risk factor, a precursor lesion, or have no association with malignancy.
  The aim of this study was to compare the genetic alterations in benign apocrine
  hyperplasia with apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS and invasive apocrine carcinomas
  of the breast using comparative genomic hybridization. The mean number of alterations
  in apocrine hyperplasia was 4.1 n 10 compared to 10.2 in apocrine DCIS n 10 and
  14.8 n 4 in invasive carcinoma. The most common alterations in apocrine hyperplasia
  were gains of 2q, 13q, and 1p and losses of 1p, 17q, 22q, 2p, 10q, and 16q. Apocrine
  DCIS and invasive carcinomas showed gains of 1q, 2q, 1p, and losses of 1p, 22q,
  17q, 12q, and 16q as their most common DNA copy number changes. Apocrine hyperplasia
  is considered to be a benign lesion and its relationship to invasive carcinoma remains
  unclear. Our data suggest that some apocrine hyperplasias may be clonal proliferations.
  The mean number of alterations are lower in apocrine hyperplasia, however the changes
  show considerable overlap with those identified in in situ and invasive apocrine
  carcinoma. These alterations are also commonly seen in nonapocrine breast cancer.
  The data are consistent with apocrine hyperplasia as a putative nonobligate precursor
  of apocrine carcinoma.
