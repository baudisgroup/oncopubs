abstract: 'BACKGROUND: High-resolution genomic microarrays enable simultaneous detection
  of copy-number aberrations such as the known recurrent aberrations in chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia del 11q , del 13q , del 17p and trisomy 12 , and copy-number neutral loss
  of heterozygosity. Moreover, comparison of genomic profiles from sequential patients
  samples allows detection of clonal evolution. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened samples
  from 369 patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia from a population-based
  cohort using 250K single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays. Clonal evolution was evaluated
  in 59 follow-up samples obtained after 5-9 years. RESULTS: At diagnosis, copy-number
  aberrations were identified in 90 of patients 70 carried known recurrent alterations,
  including del 13q 55 , trisomy 12 10.5 , del 11q 10 , and del 17p 4 . Additional
  recurrent aberrations were detected on chromosomes 2 1.9 , 4 1.4 , 8 1.6 and 14
  1.6 . Thirteen patients 3.5 displayed recurrent copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity
  on 13q, of whom 11 had concurrent homozygous del 13q . Genomic complexity and large
  13q deletions correlated with inferior outcome, while the former was linked to poor-prognostic
  aberrations. In the follow-up study, clonal evolution developed in 8 24 33 patients
  with unmutated IGHV, and in 4 25 16 IGHV-mutated and treated patients. In contrast,
  untreated patients with mutated IGHV n 10 did not acquire additional aberrations.
  The most common secondary event, del 13q , was detected in 6 12 50 of all patients
  with acquired alterations. Interestingly, aberrations on, for example, chromosome
  6q, 8p, 9p and 10q developed exclusively in patients with unmutated IGHV. CONCLUSIONS:
  Whole-genome screening revealed a high frequency of genomic aberrations in newly
  diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clonal evolution was associated with other
  markers of aggressive disease and commonly included the known recurrent aberrations.'
