abstract: 'Analysis of recurrent DNA amplification can lead to the identification
  of cancer driver genes, but this process is often hampered by the low resolution
  of existing copy number analysis platforms. Fifty-one breast tumors were profiled
  for copy number alterations CNAs with the high-resolution Affymetrix 500K SNP array.
  These tumors were also expression-profiled and surveyed for mutations in selected
  genes commonly mutated in breast cancer TP53, CDKN2A, ERBB2, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN
  . Combined analysis of common CNAs and mutations revealed putative associations
  between features. Analysis of both the prevalence and amplitude of CNAs defined
  regions of recurrent alteration. Compared with previous array comparative genomic
  hybridization studies, our analysis provided boundaries for frequently altered regions
  that were approximately one-fourth the size, greatly reducing the number of potential
  alteration-driving genes. Expression data from matched tumor samples were used to
  further interrogate the functional relevance of genes located in recurrent amplicons.
  Although our data support the importance of some known driver genes such as ERBB2,
  refined amplicon boundaries at other locations, such as 8p11-12 and 11q13.5-q14.2,
  greatly reduce the number of potential driver genes and indicate alternatives to
  commonly suggested driver genes in some cases. For example, the previously reported
  recurrent amplification at 17q23.2 is reduced to a 249 kb minimal region containing
  the putative driver RPS6KB1 as well as the putative oncogenic microRNA mir-21. High-resolution
  copy number analysis provides refined insight into many breast cancer amplicons
  and their relationships to gene expression, point mutations and breast cancer subtype
  classifications. This article contains Supplementary Material available at http:
