abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed for identification
  of chromosomal imbalances in 23 samples of fibroadenomas of the breast. Chromosomal
  gains rather than losses were a feature of these lesions. Only two cases with a
  familial and or previous history of breast lesions had gain of 1q or 16q as the
  sole abnormality. The most frequently overrepresented segments were 5p14 10 23 cases
  , 5q34-qter 6 23 cases , 13q32-qter 6 23 cases , 10q25-qter 5 23 cases , and 18q22
  4 23 cases . Some of these regions have previously been associated with breast carcinoma,
  but this study indicates that gain of these regions can also occur in benign breast
  lesions. Our findings may provide a basis for conducting further investigations
  to locate and identify genes associated with proliferation that may be involved
  in the early steps of tumorigenesis of the breast.
