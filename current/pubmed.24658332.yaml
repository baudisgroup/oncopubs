abstract: Despite recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), it remains
  an incurable disease potentially due to the presence of resistant myeloma cancer
  stem cells (MM-CSC). Although the presence of clonogenic cells in MM was described
  three decades ago, the phenotype of MM-CSC is still controversial, especially with
  respect to the expression of syndecan-1 (CD138). Here, we demonstrate the presence
  of two subpopulations--CD138++ (95-99%) and CD138low (1-5%)--in eight MM cell lines.
  To find out possible stem-cell-like features, we have phenotypically, genomic and
  functionally characterized the two subpopulations. Our results show that the minor
  CD138low subpopulation is morphologically identical to the CD138++ fraction and
  does not represent a more immature B-cell compartment (with lack of CD19, CD20 and
  CD27 expression). Moreover, both subpopulations have similar gene expression and
  genomic profiles. Importantly, both CD138++ and CD138low subpopulations have similar
  sensitivity to bortezomib, melphalan and doxorubicin. Finally, serial engraftment
  in CB17-SCID mice shows that CD138++ as well as CD138low cells have self-renewal
  potential and they are phenotypically interconvertible. Overall, our results differ
  from previously published data in MM cell lines which attribute a B-cell phenotype
  to MM-CSC. Future characterization of clonal plasma cell subpopulations in MM patients'
  samples will guarantee the discovery of more reliable markers able to discriminate
  true clonogenic myeloma cells.
