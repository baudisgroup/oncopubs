abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is an aggressive tumor, but a subset of patients
  may follow an indolent clinical course. To understand the mechanisms underlying
  this biological heterogeneity, we performed whole-genome and or whole-exome sequencing
  on 29 MCL cases and their respective matched normal DNA, as well as 6 MCL cell lines.
  Recurrently mutated genes were investigated by targeted sequencing in an independent
  cohort of 172 MCL patients. We identified 25 significantly mutated genes, including
  known drivers such as ataxia-telangectasia mutated ATM , cyclin D1 CCND1 , and the
  tumor suppressor TP53 mutated genes encoding the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC3 and
  Toll-like receptor 2 TLR2 and the chromatin modifiers WHSC1, MLL2, and MEF2B. We
  also found NOTCH2 mutations as an alternative phenomenon to NOTCH1 mutations in
  aggressive tumors with a dismal prognosis. Analysis of two simultaneous or subsequent
  MCL samples by whole-genome whole-exome n 8 or targeted n 19 sequencing revealed
  subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis in samples from different topographic sites
  and modulation of the initial mutational profile at the progression of the disease.
  Some mutations were predominantly clonal or subclonal, indicating an early or late
  event in tumor evolution, respectively. Our study identifies molecular mechanisms
  contributing to MCL pathogenesis and offers potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
