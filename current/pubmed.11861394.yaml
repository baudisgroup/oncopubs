abstract: Oncogene activation by gene amplification is a major pathogenetic mechanism
  in human cancer. Using comparative genomic hybridization, we determined that metastatic
  human colon cancers commonly acquire numerous extra copies of chromosome arms 7p,
  8q, 13q, and 20q. We then examined the consequence of these amplifications on gene
  expression using DNA microarrays. Of 55,000 transcripts profiled, 2,146 were determined
  to map to one of the four common colon cancer amplicons and to also be expressed
  in normal or malignant colon tissues. Of these, only 81 transcripts 3.8 demonstrated
  a 2-fold increase over normal expression among cancers bearing the corresponding
  chromosomal amplification. Chromosomal amplifications are common in colon cancer
  metastasis, but increased expression of genes within these amplicons is rare.
