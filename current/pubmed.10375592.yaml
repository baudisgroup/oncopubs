abstract: A malignant insulinoma LOHG-I , a carcinoid of the lung LOHG-L , a parathyroid
  adenoma LOHG-NSA , and a fibroma LOHG-F were obtained from a patient with multiple
  endocrine neoplasia type 1 MEN1 . Long-term cultures were established. Essential
  neurobiological properties of the cell lines were proven immunocytochemically and
  by electron microscopy. Molecular analysis of the germline DNA showed a 4 bp deletion
  in exon 3 of the MEN1 gene. Cytogenetic and CGH analyses of the tumors tumor cell
  lines revealed diploidy and balanced and unbalanced structural aberrations different
  for each tumor. Chromosomes 6q21, 11q and 17q were most frequently involved in clonal
  structural aberrations.
