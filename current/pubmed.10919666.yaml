abstract: 'To identify genetic changes related to tumor progression and find out diagnostic
  and prognostic genetic markers in gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs , 95 tumor
  samples 24 benign GISTs, 36 malignant primary GISTs, and 35 GIST-metastases from
  60 patients were studied using comparative genomic hybridization. DNA copy number
  changes were detected in all samples. Benign GISTs had a mean of 2.6 aberrations
  sample losses:gains, 5:1 and significantly fewer DNA copy number changes and fewer
  gains than malignant primary and metastatic GISTs P amp lt 0.01 . High-level amplifications
  were not seen in benign GISTs. Malignant primary GISTs had a mean of 7.5 aberrations
  tumor losses: gains, 1.6:1 , whereas the mean number of aberrations metastatic GIST
  was 9 losses:gains, 1.8:1 . Frequent changes observed in all GIST groups included
  losses in chromosome arms 1p 51 , 14q 74 , and 22q 53 . Gains and high-level amplifications
  at 8q and 17q were significantly more frequent in metastatic GISTs 57 and 43 than
  in benign GISTs 8 and 0 P amp lt 0.001 and malignant primary GISTs 33 and 25 P amp
  lt 0.05 . Gains and high-level amplifications at 20q were only seen in malignant
  primary and metastatic GISTs P amp lt 0.01 , and gains at 5p were not detected in
  benign GISTs P amp lt 0.01 . Losses in chromosome arm 9p were never seen in benign
  tumors P amp lt 0.001 , and they were more frequent in metastatic GISTs than in
  malignant primary GISTs 63 and 36 P amp lt 0.05 . Losses in 13q were less frequent
  in benign GISTs than in malignant primary P amp lt 0.05 and metastatic P amp lt
  0.01 GISTs. Our results show that several DNA copy number changes are related to
  the behavior of GISTs and can be used as prognostic markers for tumor progression.'
