abstract: The objectives are to determine the frequency of chromosomal aberrations
  in 22 patients in the United Kingdom with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
  and to compare our results with studies reported from western Europe and North America
  and highlight changes common to all groups, thus enabling focused study of important
  gene loci.
