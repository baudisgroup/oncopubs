abstract: 'This study was designed to evaluate 4 new cases of papillary glioneuronal
  tumors PGNTs , 2 of which had atypical histologic features, provides extensive IHC
  characterization, performed comparative genomic hybridization in 2 of our cases,
  and reviews the recent literature. The study group comprised 3 women and 1 man,
  with ages ranging from 12 to 75 years. Patients presented with seizures n 3 or muscle
  spasm n 1 , and the tumors were located in the supratentorial region of the brain
  3 in the frontal and 1 in the parietotemporal lobe . The 2 atypical tumors showed
  a moderately high mitotic rate 4 and 7 10 HPF, each , vascular endothelial hyperplasia,
  and necrosis. Tumor cells expressed both neuronal and glial markers, but the degree
  of neuronal versus glial expression was varied. None of the tumors expressed p53,
  EGFR wild type vIII, IDH1, or CD34 however, nestin, galectin-3, and S100 were positive
  in the tumor cells. No EGFR gene amplification or 1p 19q deletion was found by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. Half of the cases revealed PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry,
  and MGMT methylation was positive in 3 cases by MGMT methylation-specific polymerase
  chain reaction. Ultrastructurally, either astrocytic or neuronal differentiation
  was observed, but we could not identify any hybrid cells. An array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization study revealed loss of 1q, 6p, 8p, 9p, 9q, and 16q and gain
  of 2q, 3p, 5q, 6p, 7q, 10q, 16q, 19p, and 22q in 2 cases simultaneously. The first
  patient, who underwent subtotal resection, died because of progression of the tumor
  within 9 months after surgery however, 2 patients were symptom free and progression
  free at 34 and 48 months after gross total resection the patient 2: plus radiotherapy,
  the patient 3: no adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy . The last patient developed seizures
  after a long symptom-free period 40 mo with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Our
  4 new cases, in conjunction with the literature review, reinforce that PGNTs are
  tumors that usually occur in young adults mean age, 24 y they are most often cystic
  with a mural nodule or are cystic solid, supratentorial, closely located with the
  ventricle, molecularly genetically different from astrocytic or oligodendroglial
  tumors, and indolent in behavior. Cases 2 of 4 in our study with atypical histologic
  features or that occur in advanced age 75 y , and sporadic reports of histologically
  or biologically aggressive PGNTs, serve to remind pathologists that the full spectrum
  of PGNTs is as yet unknown.'
