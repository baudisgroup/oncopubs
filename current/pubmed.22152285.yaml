abstract: It has been postulated that ionizing radiation induces breast cancers among
  atomic bomb A-bomb survivors. We have reported a higher incidence of HER2 and C-MYC
  oncogene amplification in breast cancers from A-bomb survivors. The purpose of this
  study was to clarify the effect of A-bomb radiation exposure on genomic instability
  GIN , which is an important hallmark of carcinogenesis, in archival formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded FFPE tissues of breast cancer by using microarray-comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH .
