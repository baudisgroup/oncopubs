abstract: The differential diagnosis between benign Spitz nevus and malignant melanoma
  may present considerable difficulties in some cases. Here we report 2 unusual melanocytic
  tumors with spitzoid features developing in acral sites of Japanese patients to
  illustrate the use of comparative genomic hybridization CGH to classify these lesions.
  Case 1 was a 12-mm-thick, amp gt 2 cm-diameter nodule on the sole of a 37-year-old
  man. Case 2 was a subungual tumor of the left index finger in a 13-year-old boy.
  CGH showed absence of chromosomal aberrations in case 1 and multiple aberrations
  in case 2, including focused amplification as previously described in acral melanomas.
  Case 1 was free of disease after 2.5 years of follow-up, whereas case 2 developed
  lymph node metastasis. We conclude that molecular techniques such as CGH can be
  of diagnostic help in the classification of histologically ambiguous lesions.
