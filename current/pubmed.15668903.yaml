abstract: Nongestational choriocarcinomas are rare tumors. In the gastrointestinal
  tract, they are characterized by a biphasic tumor growth with separated areas of
  adenocarcinomatous and choriocarcinomatous differentiation. We here report a case
  of a combined adenocarcinoma-choriocarcinoma of the rectum. The tumor showed an
  aggressive clinical behavior with metastasis to the liver and lungs. A transient
  partial remission was achieved after 4 cycles of cisplatinum, etoposide, and ifosfamide
  chemotherapy, with normalization of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels.
  At this time, viable residual choriocarcinoma cells were found in surgically resected
  lung metastasis. The patient succumbed 8 months after initial diagnosis to a rapid
  abdominal relapse. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization to elucidate the genetic relationship of adenocarcinoma and
  choriocarcinoma in this neoplasm. We found genetic changes characteristic for colorectal
  adenocarcinomas, a loss of chromosomal regions 8p21-pter as well as 18q21-pter,
  and a gain of 5p and 20q, in both tumor parts. This provides evidence for the common
  origin of both components. A differential pattern of additional genetic changes
  suggests a clonal evolution from a common ancestor cell. In contrast to findings
  from a comparative study on a choriocarcinoma of the renal pelvis, we did not find
  an amplification of the germ cell cancer-associated chromosomal region 12p11.2-p12.1
  in the areas of choriocarcinoma but found instead a loss of Xp11.3-pter. To our
  knowledge, this is the first report of a CGH comparison of the adenocarcinomatous
  and choriocarcinomatous tumor parts in a nongestational choriocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal
  tract.
