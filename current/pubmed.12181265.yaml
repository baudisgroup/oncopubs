abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma. In contrast to many other hematological malignancies, no chromosomal abnormalities
  with a diagnostic or prognostic value have been identified in DLBCL. Numerical chromosomal
  imbalances were characterized by comparative genomic hybridization CGH performed
  on 54 DLBCL tumors from a total of 40 patients. The clonal relatedness was demonstrated
  in 9 of 11 pairs of matched diagnostic tumors and their relapses as determined by
  IGH gene rearrangement analysis and or the CGH profiles. Furthermore, immunohistochemical
  expression analyses of BCL2 and BCL6 LAZ3 were performed on all cases. Copy number
  changes were detected in 94 of the diagnostic tumor samples and in all of the relapses.
  Chromosomal losses in diagnostic tumors were preferentially observed at 8p22-pter
  29 , 1p34-pter 26 , 6q23-qter 20 , 17p12-pter 17 and 22q 17 , 9p23-pter 14 , whereas
  gains were mainly seen in Xq25-26 43 , 13q22 26 , 12cen-q14 20 , 3q24-25 11 , 7
  11 , and 18q12-21 11 . Loss of 22q was significantly more commonly seen in the diagnostic
  tumor samples with more advanced clinical stage in other words, Stage III-IV compared
  with Stage I-II, and band 18q21 was significantly more often gained in relapses
  as compared to diagnostic tumors. None of the recurrent alterations were detected
  as a single abnormality, suggesting that other genetic lesions below the detection
  level of CGH may be the initiating event in the tumorigenesis of DLBCL. However,
  the distribution of CGH alterations support the idea of a progression of genetic
  events where loss of 8p and 9p and gain of 3q, 13q, and 18q would represent relatively
  early events because they were distributed in tumors with only two abnormalities.
