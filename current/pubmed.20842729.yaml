abstract: Hereditary breast cancers BCs are incompletely explained by BRCA genes abnormalities,
  as 70 of them are not associated with known genetic alterations. Array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH of tumors provides an opportunity for identifying new
  BC susceptibility genes. By analyzing our database of high-resolution aCGH profiles
  of 330 BCs, we identified a case with homozygous deletion of the entire BARD1 gene.
  The BARD1-deleted case displayed a familial history of BC and other clinico-pathological
  features of BRCAness, and a 17 probability of BRCA1 2 mutation. Analysis of constitutional
  DNA showed a BARD1 germline heterozygous deletion without BRCA1 2 mutation. Gene
  expression analysis using DNA microarrays classified the tumor as basal-like, with
  very low BARD1 and ID4 expression, but high expression of BRCA1, RAD51, PARP1, CHEK1,
  and FANCA. The tumor displayed a BRCA1-mutated expression profile. This is the first
  report of a non-BRCA1 2-mutated BC with somatic homozygous and germ-line heterozygous
  deletion of the entire BARD1 gene. This observation suggests that BARD1 might be
  a BC susceptibility gene that follows the Knudson rule. Identification of BARD1
  deletion could have clinical applications including screening for hereditary forms.
