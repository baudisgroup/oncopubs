abstract: By using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we characterized the genetic
  profiles of 36 VHL-related pheochromocytomas. We then compared the results with
  those of sporadic and MEN 2-related pheochromocytomas. In 36 VHL-related tumors,
  loss of chromosome 3 and chromosome 11 were found in 34 tumors 94 and 31 tumors
  86 , respectively. There was significant concordance of deletions in chromosomes
  3 and 11 Kappa 0.64, P 0.0095 , suggesting that they are involved in two different
  but necessary and complementary genetic pathways. The loss of chromosome 11 appeared
  to be specific for VHL-related pheochromocytoma as it was not present in any of
  the 10 VHL-related CNS hemangioblastomas studied and was significantly less common
  when compared with a sporadic pheochromocytomas from previously published results
  13 P amp lt 0.0001 , and b MEN 2-related pheochromocytomas from this and previously
  published studies 30 P 0.0012 . In summary, this is the first report of a novel
  consistent genetic alteration that is selected and specific for VHL-related pheochromocytoma,
  besides the two hits of the VHL gene.
