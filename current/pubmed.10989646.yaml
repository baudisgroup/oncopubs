abstract: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL can be classified as typical or
  atypical based on morphologic and immunophenotypic features. The relationship between
  these 2 groups is uncertain, and there is some evidence they may be different entities.
  We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to explore the cytogenetic relationship
  between typical and atypical B-cell CLL. Results showed a similar pattern of chromosome
  gains and losses detected in typical and atypical B-cell CLL, suggesting they are
  related disorders. Gain on chromosome 12 material occurred in cases that were apparently
  normal by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . The common region
  mapped to chromosome 12q21. Gains on chromosome 4 were present in 74 32 of cases
  analyzed and were confirmed by interphase FISH in 30 13 of cases. We previously
  have shown the strong association between trisomy 12 as detected by FISH and CD11a
  expression in atypical B-cell CLL. In the present study, CGH demonstrated additional
  gains on 12p and 12q outside the common amplified region of 12q21 in these patients.
