abstract: We investigated 31 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNSTs from
  23 patients by means of comparative genomic hybridization CGH in order to study
  quantitative genomic aberrations of these tumors. Twenty-one of the 23 patients
  revealed changes, with a mean value of 11 aberrations per sample range 2-29 . The
  minimal common regions of the most frequent gains were 8q23-q24.1 12 cases , 5p14
  11 cases , and 6p22-pter, 7p15-p21, 7q32-q35, 8q21.1-q22, 8q24.2-qter, and 17q22-qter
  10 cases each . Seventeen high-level amplifications were detected in eight of the
  21 samples. In three cases, the high-level amplifications involved 8q24.1-qter,
  and in two cases each the high-level amplifications involved regions 5p14, 7p14-pter,
  8q21.1-q23, and 13q32-q33. The minimal common region of frequent losses was 14q24.3-qter
  five cases . The gain of 8q as a single common change in the primary tumor, the
  recurrence, and the metastasis from the same patient suggests that this aberration
  is an early change in the tumorigenesis of MPNSTs. Comparable aberrations were observed
  in separate tumors of the same patients affected by Recklinghausens disease, indicating
  a limited number of accidental secondary changes. In sporadic MPNSTs, the most frequent
  gains were narrowed down predominantly to 5p, 6, 8q, and 20q, whereas in MPNSTs
  from patients with Recklinghausens disease, there was most often a gain in 7q, 8q,
  15q, and 17q. The occurrence of gain of both 7p15-p21 and 17q22-qter was associated
  with a statistically significant poor overall survival rate P 0.0096 .
