abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs pose an important diagnostic and treatment
  challenge because of the genetic heterogeneity and poorly understood biology of
  the disease. To investigate initiating genomic alterations and the potential prognostic
  significance of cryptic genomic changes in low-risk MDS, we performed whole genome
  tiling path array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH on CD34 cells from 44 patients
  with an International Prognostic Scoring System score less than or equal to 1.0.
  Clonal copy number differences were detected in cells from 36 of 44 patients. In
  contrast, cells from only 16 of the 44 patients displayed karyotypic abnormalities.
  Although most patients had normal karyotype, aCGH identified 21 recurring copy number
  alterations. Examples of frequent cryptic alterations included gains at 11q24.2-qter,
  17q11.2, and 17q12 and losses at 2q33.1-q33.2, 5q13.1-q13.2, and 10q21.3. Maintenance
  of genomic integrity defined as less than 3 Mb total disruption of the genome correlated
  with better overall survival P .002 and was less frequently associated with transformation
  to acute myeloid leukemia P .033 . This study suggests a potential role for the
  use of aCGH in the clinical workup of MDS patients.
