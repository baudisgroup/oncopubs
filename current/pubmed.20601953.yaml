abstract: Abnormalities of chromosome 7q are common in myeloid malignancies, but no
  specific target genes have yet been identified. Here, we describe the finding of
  homozygous EZH2 mutations in 9 of 12 individuals with 7q acquired uniparental disomy.
  Screening of a total of 614 individuals with myeloid disorders revealed 49 monoallelic
  or biallelic EZH2 mutations in 42 individuals the mutations were found most commonly
  in those with myelodysplastic myeloproliferative neoplasms 27 out of 219 individuals,
  or 12 and in those with myelofibrosis 4 out of 30 individuals, or 13 . EZH2 encodes
  the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 , a highly conserved
  histone H3 lysine 27 H3K27 methyltransferase that influences stem cell renewal by
  epigenetic repression of genes involved in cell fate decisions. EZH2 has oncogenic
  activity, and its overexpression has previously been causally linked to differentiation
  blocks in epithelial tumors. Notably, the mutations we identified resulted in premature
  chain termination or direct abrogation of histone methyltransferase activity, suggesting
  that EZH2 acts as a tumor suppressor for myeloid malignancies.
