abstract: Genomic instability with frequent DNA copy number alterations is one of
  the key hallmarks of carcinogenesis. The chromosomal regions with frequent DNA copy
  number gain and loss in human gastric cancer are still poorly defined. It remains
  unknown how the DNA copy number variations contributes to the changes of gene expression
  profiles, especially on the global level.
