abstract: Glioblastomas are cytogenetically heterogeneous tumors that frequently display
  alterations of chromosomes 7, 9p, and 10q. We used high-density 500K single-nucleotide
  polymorphism arrays to investigate genome-wide copy number alterations and loss
  of heterozygosity in 35 primary glioblastomas. We focused on the identification
  and detailed characterization of alterations involving the most frequently altered
  chromosomes chromosomes 7, 9, and 10 , the identification of distinct prognostic
  subgroups of glioblastomas based on the cytogenetic patterns of alteration for these
  chromosomes, and validation of their prognostic impact in a larger series of tumors
  from public databases. Gains of chromosome 7 97 , with or without epidermal growth
  factor receptor EGFR amplification, and losses of chromosomes 9p 83 and 10 91 were
  the most frequent alterations. Such alterations defined five different cytogenetic
  groups with a significant effect on patient survival notably, EGFR amplification
  29 was associated with a better survival among older patients, as confirmed by multivariate
  analysis of a larger series of glioblastomas from the literature. In addition, our
  results provide further evidence about the relevance of other genes eg, EGFR, CDKN2A
  B, MTAP in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas. Altogether, our results confirm the
  cytogenetic heterogeneity of glioblastomas and suggest that their stratification
  based on combined assessment of cytogenetic alterations involving chromosomes 7,
  9, and 10 may contribute to the prognostic evaluation of glioblastomas.
