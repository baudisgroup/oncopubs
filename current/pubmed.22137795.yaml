abstract: Tumor heterogeneity has been implicated in tumor growth and progression
  as well as resistance to therapy. We present an example of genetic heterogeneity
  in human malignant brain tumors in which multiple closely related driver genes are
  amplified and activated simultaneously in adjacent intermingled cells. We have observed
  up to three different receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, MET, PDGFRA amplified in single
  tumors in different cells in a mutually exclusive fashion. Each subpopulation was
  actively dividing, and the genetic changes resulted in protein production, and coexisting
  subpopulations shared common early genetic mutations indicating their derivation
  from a single precursor cell. The stable coexistence of different clones within
  the same tumor will have important clinical implications for tumor resistance to
  targeted therapies.
