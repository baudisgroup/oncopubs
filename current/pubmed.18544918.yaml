abstract: We aimed to directly align a chromosomal CGH cCGH pattern with the gene
  mapping data by taking advantage of the clustering of the GGCC motif at certain
  positions in the human genome. The alignment of chromosomal with sequence data was
  achieved by superimposition of i the fluorescence intensity of the sequence specific
  fluorochrome, Chromomycin A3 CMA3 , ii the cCGH fluorescence intensity profile of
  individual chromosomes and iii the GGCC density profile extracted from the Ensembl
  genome sequence database. The superimposition of these three pieces of information
  allowed us to precisely localize regions of amplification in the neuroblastoma cell
  line STA-NB-15. Two prominent cCGH peaks were noted, one at 2p24.3, the position
  15.4 mega base Mb , and the other at 2p23.2, 29.51 Mb. FISH and high resolution
  array CGH aCGH experiments disclosed an amplification of MYCN 16 Mb and ALK 29.2-29.9
  Mb , thus confirming the cCGH data. The combined visualization of sequence information
  and cCGH data drastically improves the resolution of the method to less than 2 Mb.
