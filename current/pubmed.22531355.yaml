abstract: To improve the clinical outcome of patients with gastric cancer, intensified
  combination strategies are currently in clinical development, including combinations
  of more extensive surgery, neo adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The present
  study used DNA copy number profiling to identify subgroups of patients with different
  clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that, by identification of subgroups, individual
  treatment strategies can be selected to improve clinical outcome and to reduce unnecessary
  treatment toxicity for patients with gastric cancer.
