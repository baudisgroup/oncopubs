abstract: Metaphase M- and array A- Comparative Genomic Hybridization CGH were used
  to investigate 40 cases of T- and 32 of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL
  with normal failed cytogenetics. M-CGH was performed in all cases and A-CGH in 10
  12 T-ALL cases with uncertain normal M-CGH results. M-CGH was abnormal in 38 72
  cases, with a total of 110 imbalances 60 gains, 50 losses . 25 40 patients with
  T-ALL 62.5 showed 77 imbalances, with at least 1 genomic imbalance and a mean of
  3 aberrations patient range 1-12 . 13 32 patients with B-ALL 40.6 presented 34 imbalances,
  with a mean of 2.6 imbalances range 1-8 . A-CGH detected 4 more T-ALL cases with
  genomic imbalances. A-CGH identified NF1 17q11.2 deletion and interphase fluorescence
  in situ hybridization provided a 10.8 estimated overall incidence of NF1 17q11.2
  deletion in T-ALL. In all but one case 6 7 with NF1 deletion, denaturing high-performance
  liquid chromatography and direct sequencing detected NOTCH1 gene mutations. Three
  or more imbalances in CGH-positive cases were significantly associated with resistance
  to treatment and death during or after induction therapy. We suggest that the work-up
  for ALL at diagnosis should include CGH investigations, particularly when cytogenetics
  is uninformative, because they may provide potentially valuable information with
  prognostic and therapeutic implications.
