abstract: We hypothesized that analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism arrays SNP-A
  and new molecular defects may provide new insight in the pathogenesis of systemic
  mastocytosis SM . SNP-A karyotyping was applied to identify recurrent areas of loss
  of heterozygosity and bidirectional sequencing was performed to evaluate the mutational
  status of TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1 IDH2 and the CBL gene family. Overall
  survival OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. We studied a total of 26
  patients with SM. In 67 of SM patients, SNP-A karyotyping showed new chromosomal
  abnormalities including uniparental disomy of 4q and 2p spanning TET2 KIT and DNMT3A.
  Mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1 and CBL were found in 23 , 12 , 12 , and 4 of SM
  patients, respectively. No mutations were observed in EZH2 and IDH1 IDH2. Significant
  differences in OS were observed for SM mutated patients grouped based on the presence
  of combined TET2 DNMT3A ASXL1 mutations independent of KIT P 0.04 and sole TET2
  mutations P amp lt 0.001 . In conclusion, TET2, DNMT3A and ASXL1 mutations are also
  present in mastocytosis and these mutations may affect prognosis, as demonstrated
  by worse OS in mutated patients.
