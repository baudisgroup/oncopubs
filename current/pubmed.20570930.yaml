abstract: As genome-scale technologies begin to unravel the complexity of the equivalent
  tumors in adults, we can attempt detailed characterization of high-grade gliomas
  in children, that have until recently been lacking. Toward this end, we sought to
  validate and extend investigations of the differences between pediatric and adult
  tumors.
