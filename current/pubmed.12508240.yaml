abstract: Forty-nine primary retinoblastoma Rb tumors were analyzed by the use of
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and clinical histological correlations were
  performed. Adverse histological factors were present in 13 patients. Chromosomal
  imbalance was a frequent phenomenon, seen in 96 of the tumors. Gain of 6p represented
  the most frequent event 69 of the tumors , whereas 1q was observed in 57 , confirming
  that these abnormalities are key secondary events in retinoblastoma tumor progression.
  Loss of 13q and 16 was significantly associated with tumors displaying adverse histo-prognostic
  factors, whereas -16q was significantly associated with tumors without adverse features.
  In three patients who developed an extra-ocular relapse, the tumors showed -13q
  and 2 3 had -5q, suggesting that these abnormalities may be associated with metastasis.
  Children amp gt or 36 months of age at enucleation tended to have more CGH abnormalities
  per tumor than children amp lt 12 months median numbers 11 vs. 3 . In addition,
  1q, 13q, -16, and -16q were more frequent in children with an older age at enucleation.
  Identical CGH changes were found in both tumors from one patient with bilateral
  tumors, suggesting a common origin. It is possible that tumors displaying loss of
  13q and 5q indicate those patients who may suffer an adverse outcome and who would
  require alternative or more intensive therapy. CGH analysis on larger cohorts and
  in prospective clinical trials will be invaluable in determining whether a genetic
  classification of retinoblastoma represents a reliable measure of prognosis.
