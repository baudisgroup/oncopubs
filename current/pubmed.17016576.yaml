abstract: Biliary tract cancers carry dismal prognoses. It is commonly understood
  that chromosomal aberrations in cancer cells have prognostic and therapeutic implications.
  However, in biliary tract cancers the genetic changes have not yet been sufficiently
  studied. The aim of this study was to clarify the presence of mutations in specific
  chromosomal regions that are likely to harbor previously unknown genes with a significant
  role in the genesis of biliary tract cancer. The recently developed bacterial artificial
  chromosome BAC array comparative genomic hybridization CGH can facilitate detail
  analysis with high resolution and sensitivity. We applied this to 12 cancer cell
  lines of the gallbladder GBC and the bile duct BDC using a genome-wide scanning
  array. Cell line DNA was labeled with green colored Cy5 and reference DNA derived
  from normal human leucocytes was labeled with red colored Cy3. GBC, as well as BDC
  cell lines, have shown DNA copy number abnormalities gain or loss . In each of the
  seven GBC cell lines, the DNA copy number was gained on 6p21.32 and was lost on
  3p22.3, 3p14.2, 3p14.3, 4q13.1, 22q11.21, 22q11.23, respectively. In five BDC cell
  lines, there were DNA copy number gains on 7p21.1, 7p21.2, 17q23.2, 20q13.2 and
  losses were on 1p36.21, 4q25, 6q16.1, 18q21.31, 18q21.33, respectively. The largest
  region of gain was observed on 13q14.3-q21.32 approximately 11 Mb and of loss on
  18q12.2-q21.1 approximately 15 Mb , respectively. Both GBC and BDC cell lines have
  DNA copy number abnormalities of gains and or losses on every chromosome. We were
  able to determine the genetic differences between gallbladder and bile duct cancer
  cell lines. BAC array CGH has a powerful potential application in the screening
  for DNA copy number abnormalities in cancer cell lines and tumors.
