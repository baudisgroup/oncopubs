abstract: Soft tissue malignant myoepithelioma STMM is a particularly rare tumor displaying
  myoepithelial elements and lacking obvious ductal differentiation. From the one
  case report with cytogenetic data available in the literature, STMM seems to be
  a distinct entity with some resemblance to chordoma on the one hand and myoepithelioma
  on the other. The present case of STMM yielded novel data from high-resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization HR-CGH analysis. An 82-year-old female patient presented with
  a soft tissue tumor within the deep soft tissues in the right gluteal muscle measuring
  16 x 13 x 11 cm. Histologically, the lesion was diagnosed as a myoepithelial carcinoma.
  Immunohistochemistry was focally positive for pancytokeratin, EMA, S-100 protein,
  and alpha smooth muscle actin. HR-CGH analysis revealed gains of 1p31 approximately
  p34, 1q21 approximately q23, 9q12 approximately q33, and 16q22 and losses of 1p11
  approximately p22, 1q24 approximately q44, 3p, 10q11.1 approximately q22, 13q, 14q13
  approximately q24, and 15q. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis
  confirmed deletion of 3p, gain of 16q, and monosomy of chromosomes 13 and 15. These
  results support the hypothesis that STMM is a distinct entity, not sharing the cytogenetic
  alterations of salivary gland myoepithelial carcinomas and ductal carcinomas of
  breast with myoepithelial differentiation.
