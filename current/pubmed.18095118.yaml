abstract: Medulloblastoma MB is the most frequent infratentorial malignant brain tumor
  in children. In contrast, primitive neuroectodermal tumor PNET is defined as a supratentorial
  malignant tumor generated from the cerebral hemisphere. These tumors have considerable
  histological overlap but have different clinical outcomes including overall survival
  period, recurrence rate, and chemosensitivity. We investigated the amplification
  and or deletion of genes and the chromosomal gain and or loss in 10 MBs and 3 PNETs
  with a genomic DNA microarray system. Genes that are frequently amplified in these
  both these tumors include MSH2, N-myc, AKT3, and EGFR. Amplifications of SNRPN,
  MYB, and PTEN are observed only in MB. The genes associated with Wnt APC and Shh
  PTCH pathways also have some aberrations. Common chromosomal aberrations include
  gains at 17q and 7q and losses at 17p. Minor chromosomal losses were also detected
  at 1p, 8p q, 11p, 10p q, 13q, 16q, and Xp q in MB. SPNETs tend to contain fewer
  chromosomal and genetic abnormalities than MBs. In conclusion, there are gene expression
  and chromosomal differences between MBs and SPNETs. These differences may correlate
  with the prognosis.
