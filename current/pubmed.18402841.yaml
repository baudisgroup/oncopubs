abstract: The majority of cardiac atrial neoplasms represent benign myxomas. Rarely,
  malignant cardiac neoplasms are encountered and can include primary cardiac neoplasms,
  as well as secondary tumors involving the heart. As many cardiac neoplasms lack
  pathognomonic clinical features, histopathologic diagnosis is crucial for classification
  and appropriate treatment of these neoplasms. Molecular investigation is critical
  to begin to catalogue genomic changes that correlate with these malignancies.
