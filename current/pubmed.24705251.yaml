abstract: Pediatric high-grade glioma HGG is a devastating disease with a less than
  20 survival rate 2 years after diagnosis. We analyzed 127 pediatric HGGs, including
  diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas DIPGs and non-brainstem HGGs NBS-HGGs , by whole-genome,
  whole-exome and or transcriptome sequencing. We identified recurrent somatic mutations
  in ACVR1 exclusively in DIPGs 32 , in addition to previously reported frequent somatic
  mutations in histone H3 genes, TP53 and ATRX, in both DIPGs and NBS-HGGs. Structural
  variants generating fusion genes were found in 47 of DIPGs and NBS-HGGs, with recurrent
  fusions involving the neurotrophin receptor genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 in 40 of
  NBS-HGGs in infants. Mutations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-RAS-PI3K signaling,
  histone modification or chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle regulation were found
  in 68 , 73 and 59 of pediatric HGGs, respectively, including in DIPGs and NBS-HGGs.
  This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the unique and shared pathways
  driving pediatric HGG within and outside the brainstem.
