abstract: Incidence of prostate cancer in Japan and resultant mortality rates are
  lower than in Western countries. To elucidate the reasons behind this, the genetic
  characteristics of prostate cancer in Japanese patients were investigated. Comparative
  genomic hybridization was applied in 27 cases of prostate cancers in Japanese patients.
  Frequent gains were found at Xq, 8q, Xp, and 7q and frequent losses at 8p, 6q, 2q,
  16q, and 17p in decreasing order of frequency . Loss of 6q was frequently detected
  in both early and advanced tumors. Gains of 7q and 8q and loss of 8p were more frequent
  in advanced than early tumors. The frequency of 13q loss in primary tumors was significantly
  lower in patients in Japan than in European countries. These data suggest that a
  loss of 6q is associated with the development of prostate cancer, and that gains
  of 7q and 8q and a loss of 8p are linked with cancer progression. The frequency
  of 13q loss may imply differences in biological behavior of prostate cancer between
  Japan and Western countries.
