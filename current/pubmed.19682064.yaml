abstract: Little is known about the cytogenetic features and molecular mechanisms
  behind hairy cell leukaemia HCL , despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment.
  Therefore, we used high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridisation
  array-CGH and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification MLPA to characterise
  copy number alterations CNAs in DNA from 13 cases of HCL. We also summarise CNAs
  and cytogenetic features in 109 HCL cases comprising our 13 cases and 96 cases from
  the literature. Genomic array-CGH revealed imbalances in two out of 13 cases in
  addition to previously described copy number variants CNVs found in healthy individuals.
  In one case, a 700 kb deletion of 20q11.22 was detected encompassing ten characterised
  genes, among them the TP53INP2, DNCL2A and ITCH genes. In the second case, trisomy
  5, and a deletion of 5p15.2 encompassing a non-characterised gene AY328033 was found.
  Altogether only 20 81 25 of all cases studied by CGH or gene dose array revealed
  CNAs. The most common recurrent deletions and breakpoints were 14q22-32 33 , 6q25
  16 , 2p12 10 , 22q11 10 , 17p11-13 10 , 7q32-36 9 , 18q11-13 7 , 1q32-44 6 , 8p22-23
  6 and 7q11 6 . Trisomy 5 occurred in 15 . In addition, several other recurrent breakpoints
  were identified. Although a number of genomic imbalances were identified in the
  HCL samples, the genome appeared remarkably stable.
