abstract: Glial tumors are the most common tumors of the central nervous system, affecting
  individuals of all ages. Conventional cytogenetics have been unable to identify
  a consistent chromosomal translocation or rearrangement in this group of tumors
  thus, more advanced molecular cytogenetic approaches are required.
