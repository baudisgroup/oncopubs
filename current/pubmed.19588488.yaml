abstract: Gastric cancer is the second common malignant neoplasia in Japan, and its
  poorly differentiated form is a deadly disease. To identify novel candidate oncogenes
  contributing to its genesis, we examined copy-number alterations in 50 primary poorly
  differentiated gastric cancers using an array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array-CGH . Many genetic changes were identified, including a novel amplification
  of the 13q22 locus. Several genes are located in this locus, and selective knockdown
  of one for the Kr ppel-like factor 12 KLF12 induced significant growth-arrest in
  the HGC27 gastric cancer cell line. Microarray analysis also demonstrated that genes
  associated with cell proliferation were mostly changed by KLF12 knockdown. To explore
  the oncogenic function of KLF12, we introduced a full length of human KLF12 cDNA
  into NIH3T3 and AZ-521 cell lines and found that overexpression significantly enhanced
  their invasive potential. In clinical samples, KLF12 mRNA in cancer tissue was increased
  in 11 of 28 cases 39 when compared with normal gastric epithelium. Clinicopathological
  analysis further demonstrated a significant correlation between KLF12mRNA levels
  and tumor size p 0.038 . These data suggest that the KLF12 gene plays an important
  role in poorly differentiated gastric cancer progression and is a potential target
  of therapeutic measures.
