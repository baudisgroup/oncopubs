abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC is a relatively uncommon salivary gland malignancy
  known for its protean phenotypic features and pernicious clinical behavior. Currently,
  no effective therapy is available for patients with advanced nonresectable, recurrent,
  and or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic factors
  other than tumor stage that can be used to predict the outcome of the patients with
  ACC.
