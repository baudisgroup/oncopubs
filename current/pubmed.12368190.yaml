abstract: 'Large congenital melanocytic nevi CMN are at an increased risk of developing
  melanoma. Several forms of secondary proliferations can arise in congenital nevi
  on rare occasions. Although some of these closely resemble melanoma both clinically
  and histologically, metastasis is rare. We used comparative genomic hybridization
  to analyze chromosomal aberrations in different types of proliferations arising
  in CMN and compared them to typical congenital nevi, clear-cut melanomas arising
  in congenital nevi, as well as primary cutaneous melanomas that were not associated
  with a CMN. Cases of CMN and CMN with secondary proliferations were assigned to
  six groups according to the predominant histological pattern: group I, bland congenital
  nevi n 6 group II, congenital nevi with foci of increased cellularity n 4 group
  III, CMN with a proliferation simulating superficial spreading melanoma in situ
  n 3 group IV, CMN with a proliferation simulating nodular melanoma n 9 group V,
  proliferating neurocristic hamartoma n 1 and group VI, melanoma arising in congenital
  nevus n 6 . No aberrations were found in groups I to III, whereas seven of nine
  cases of group IV, and one of one case of group V, showed aberrations. In group
  IV six of seven cases with aberrations 86 showed numerical aberrations of whole
  chromosomes exclusively. This pattern differed significantly from the findings in
  melanoma that arose within CMN n 6 , group VI, or independent of CMN n 122 in which
  only 5 showed numerical changes only. The single case in group V showed aberrations
  similar to melanoma. The finding of frequent numerical chromosomal aberrations in
  atypical nodular proliferations arising in CMN identifies these as clonal neoplasms
  with a genomic instability consistent with a mitotic spindle checkpoint defect.
  This difference compared to the aberration pattern found in melanoma might explain
  their more benign clinical behavior and may be of diagnostic value in ambiguous
  cases.'
