abstract: Pediatric lipomas are rare and their etiology is unknown. As in adult lipomas,
  a segment of 12q13-q15 has been documented as a common chromosomal rearrangement
  region. Here, we report a pediatric lipoma case without rearrangement of 12q13-q15
  but with an apparently balanced translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 13 t 8
  13 q21 q22 detected by routine cytogenetic analysis, and small deletions on 5q21.1
  and 8q21.11 detected by array comparative genetic hybridization. The small deletion
  on 8q21.11 is possibly due to chromosomal instability at the breakpoint of the translocation.
