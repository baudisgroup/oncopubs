abstract: The hallmark of primary cutaneous CD30 large T cell lymphoma are large lymphoid
  tumor cells, at least 75 of which, by definition, must be positive for CD30. The
  relatively benign clinical course of this lymphoma type has been explained with
  CD30-induced apoptosis, on the assumption that expression of CD30 defines the tumor
  clone however, this hypothesis has not been tested on the molecular level to date.
  In this study we analyzed CD30 cells in four patients with primary cutaneous CD30
  large T cell lymphoma by single cell polymerase chain reaction of T cell receptor-gamma
  genes followed by sequencing. Here, we demonstrate that most of the large CD30 atypical
  cells possessed identical T cell receptor-gamma gene rearrangements, indicative
  of clonal proliferation. Nevertheless, polyclonally rearranged T cells were present
  in all CD30 samples studied. In addition, one patient showed a second clone in a
  separate biopsy and three of four patients showed chromosomal imbalances as revealed
  by comparative genomic hybridization. Taken together, our data suggest that the
  CD30 population in primary cutaneous CD30 large T cell lymphoma indeed contains
  the tumor clone, thus providing molecular support for a link between clinical course
  and CD30-related signaling. Importantly, however, CD30 expression does not define
  the tumor clone as bystander T cells, as well as occasional additional clones, are
  also present in this population.
