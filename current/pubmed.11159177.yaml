abstract: 'Although several genes genetic loci involved in the etiology of Wilms tumor
  have been identified, little is known of the molecular changes associated with relapse.
  We therefore undertook an analysis by comparative genomic hybridization CGH of 58
  tumor samples of favorable histology Wilms tumor taken at initial diagnosis and
  or relapse. Tumors with anaplastic histology were excluded as this is known to be
  associated with p53 mutation and a poor prognosis. A control group of 21 Wilms tumors
  that did not relapse was also analyzed. The overall frequency of gains or losses
  of genetic material detected by CGH was similar in both groups 77 in relapsing tumors
  and 70 in the nonrelapse group as was the median number of changes per tumor relapse
  group: n 4, range, 1 to 19 nonrelapse group: n 3, range, 1 to 8 . However, gain
  of 1q was significantly more frequent in the relapse series 27 of 46 59 versus 5
  of 21 24 , P: 0.019 . In 12 matched tumor pairs, the CGH profiles, including 1q
  gain, were similar at diagnosis and relapse, with little evidence for further copy
  number changes being involved in clonal evolution. The results suggest that 1q gain
  at diagnosis could be used to identify patients with favorable histology Wilms tumor
  at increased risk of relapse who might benefit from early treatment intensification.'
