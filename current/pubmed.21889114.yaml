abstract: Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, reliable
  markers allowing prediction of patient survival at the time of initial diagnosis
  are still lacking. Copy number alterations CNAs in tumor tissue DNA have been associated
  with tumorigenesis and malignant progression. We aimed at identification of gene-level
  CNAs with prognostic value for survival in pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma SCC
  .
