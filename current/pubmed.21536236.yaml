abstract: 'Recurrent deletions of 5q in myeloid malignancies encompass two separate
  regions: deletion of 5q33, which is associated with the 5q syndrome and haploinsufficiency
  of RPS14, and deletion of a more proximal locus at 5q31. We present a case with
  a cryptic 1.3 Mb deletion in 5q31.2 identified by array comparative genomic hybridization
  that places the proximal boundary of the deletion proximal and close to the candidate
  EGR1 gene. The patient was diagnosed initially with a myelodysplastic syndrome,
  with a del 20 q11.2q13.3 as the sole abnormality identified by karyotyping. The
  patient progressed to acute myeloid leukemia with no change to the G-banded karyotype.
  The 1.3 Mb deletion on the long arm of one chromosome 5 was confirmed to have been
  present both at presentation with myelodysplastic syndrome and at transformation.
  This is an interesting case because there are few array studies identifying cryptic
  5q deletions, and the study of these small deletions helps to refine the common
  deleted region. This case, together with previously published studies, suggests
  that the proximal boundary of the common deleted region may lie within the KDM3B
  gene.'
