abstract: 'The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) has a prognostic
  impact that distinguishes two categories of neuroblastoma: favorable histology (FH)
  and unfavorable histology (UH). We analyzed 92 cases of neuroblastoma with the INPC
  evaluation and genomic grouping to investigate the correlation between the INPC
  and genomic signature, together with their prognostic significance. The correlation
  of UH tumor and partial gains and/or losses (GGP), as well as the correlation of
  FH tumor and whole gains and/or losses (GGW), was statistically significant. Both
  UH and GGP were late-onset (median age at diagnosis was 36 and 48ï¿½months, respectively)
  and had poor prognosis (overall survival rate [OS], 43.1% and 42.4%, respectively).
  In contrast, both FH and GGW were early-onset (median age at diagnosis, 4 and 9.5ï¿½months,
  respectively) and had favorable prognosis (OS, 88.6% and 87.1%, respectively). Unfavorable
  histology and GGP had significantly inferior OS compared to FH and GGW. Overall
  survival was not significantly different among the genomic groups in FH; however,
  it was inferior in UH with GGP. In UH with a single copy MYCN, genomic subgroups
  GGP2s (both 1p and 11q losses) and GGP3s (partial 11q loss but not 1p loss) indicated
  significantly poor prognosis compared to GGP4s (no partial 1p and 11q loss). As
  INPC and MYCN amplification were found to be the most powerful prognostic biological
  factors, they should be included with genomic grouping as treatment stratification
  for patients with UH and single copy of MYCN.  ï¿½ 2015 The Authors. Cancer Science
