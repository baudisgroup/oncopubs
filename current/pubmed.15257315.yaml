abstract: A preferential use of one particular immunoglobulin variable heavy chain
  gene, V H 3-21, has recently been reported in mantle cell lymphoma, where almost
  all of these V H 3-21 mantle cell lymphomas showed usage of the same light chain
  Vlambda gene Vlambda3-19 and also had a tendency towards improved prognosis. These
  findings suggested that V H 3-21 mantle cell lymphomas constitute a distinct subgroup,
  possibly with antigen stimulation involved in disease pathogenesis. In this study,
  we applied the comparative genomic hybridization CGH method on 37 mantle cell lymphoma
  tumors in order to investigate if the V H 3-21 tumors are different at the genomic
  level. Interestingly, V H 3-21 mantle cell lymphomas n 14 showed significantly fewer
  genomic aberrations mean 2.4 compared to non-V H 3-21 mantle cell lymphomas n 23
  mean 4.9 . The chromosomal aberrations identified in our study were generally in
  accordance with previous CGH studies of mantle cell lymphoma the most frequent aberration
  was complete or partial loss of chromosome 13, followed by recurrent losses within
  6q, 9p, 9q and 11q and frequent gains in 3q, 7p, 8q and 15q. Deletions within 8p
  and 9p as well as gains in 7p and 15q were found exclusively in the non-V H 3-21-utilizing
  tumors. In summary, V H 3-21 mantle cell lymphomas demonstrated both a lower number
  and a different spectrum of genomic aberrations than mantle cell lymphoma in general,
  thus supporting the hypothesis that V H 3-21 mantle cell lymphomas constitute a
  new subgroup. The findings presented in this report may explain the tendency for
  a better clinical outcome for patients whose tumors utilize V H 3-21.
