abstract: 'PURPOSE: Myeloma bone disease impairs quality of life and is associated
  with impaired survival. Even with effective bisphosphonate treatment, a significant
  proportion of patients still develop skeletal-related events SRE . Identifying such
  patients at presentation would allow treatment modification. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
  To investigate the molecular basis of bone disease at presentation and to develop
  a predictive signature for patients at high risk of developing SREs on bisphosphonates,
  261 presenting myeloma samples were analyzed by global gene expression profiling.
  The derived SRE gene signature was complemented by the integration of associated
  clinical parameters to generate an optimal predictor. RESULTS: Fifty genes were
  significantly associated with presenting bone disease, including the WNT signaling
  antagonist DKK1 and genes involved in growth factor signaling and apoptosis. Higher
  serum calcium level and the presence of bone disease and hyperdiploidy at presentation
  were associated with high risk of SRE development. A gene signature derived from
  the fourteen genes overexpressed in the SRE group was able to identify patients
  at high risk of developing an SRE on treatment. These genes either belonged to the
  IFN-induced family or were involved in cell signaling and mitosis. Multivariate
  logistic model selection yielded an optimal SRE predictor comprising seven genes
  and calcium level, which was validated as an effective predictor in a further set
  of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The simple expression-based SRE predictor can effectively
  identify individuals at high risk of developing bone disease while being on bisphosphonates.
  This predictor could assist with developing future trials on novel therapies aimed
  at reducing myeloma bone disease.'
