abstract: 'Mucinous adenocarcinoma MAC is a rare malignancy in the minor salivary
  gland. To our knowledge, genomic alterations in this tumor have not been reported
  previously. To identify DNA copy number aberrations, we applied comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to four samples of MAC in minor salivary gland derived from two
  patients: a primary tumor and two cervical metastatic lymph nodes from one patient,
  and a primary tumor from the other patient. Copy number increases were commonly
  detected in 1q21 q31 and 20q13, and these may play an important role in MAC carcinogenesis.
  Copy number increases in 1q, 12p, 12q, and 20q were commonly detected in all three
  samples derived from patient 1, and gain of 7p and loss of chromosome 4 were additionally
  detected in the two samples derived from metastatic lymph nodes. Amplifications
  were also detected in the chromosomal regions 8q22 qter, 12p11 p12, 12q11 q21, and
  20q13. Amplification of MDM2 12q15 and of AURKA 20q13 was detected with fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. The DNA copy number aberrations detected in MAC in minor
  salivary glands were different from those reported for colorectal MAC. The present
  findings are novel in identifying genomic alterations of MAC arising from the minor
  salivary gland.'
