abstract: 'Extranodal B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT type
  may represent a model of lymphoma progression, because a small cell component frequently
  occurs in the large cell variants. We studied 52 extranodal B-cell lymphomas: 18
  extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT type MZBL,MT , 7 MZBL,MT of the
  gastro-intestinal tract with a diffuse large B-cell component giMZBLplusLBCL , and
  27 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the gastro-intestinal tract without small cell
  component giLBCL . Analytical techniques were comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . The translocation t 11 18 was
  found as the sole aberration in two MZBL,MT only. In contrast to this, t 11 18 -negative
  MZBL,MT were characterized by frequent gains on chromosome 3 and DNA amplifications
  on 2p13-p15. Furthermore, we found a clonal lymphoma progression from the small
  to the large cell component with accumulation of gains and losses of chromosomal
  material in the large cell component in giMZBLplusLBCL. Aberrations overlapping
  with MZBL,MT and giMZBLplusLBCL included losses on chromosome 13, amplifications
  of the REL proto-oncogene, or gains on chromosome 12. In addition, the large cell
  component revealed gains on 8q24, including amplifications of the MYC proto-oncogene,
  and losses on 2q. The giLBCL had frequent gains on chromosomes 12 and 9, as well
  as on 11q, and losses on 6q. We conclude that, based on the distinctive and partly
  overlapping patterns of genetic aberrations, MALT lymphomas can be divided into
  different genetic subgroups.'
