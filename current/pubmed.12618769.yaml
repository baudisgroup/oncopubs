abstract: DNA amplifications are important mechanisms for proto-oncogene activation.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH to metaphase chromosome preparations has revealed
  amplifications in 10-20 of B-cell lymphomas B-NHL . We analysed a series of 16 aggressive
  non-Hodgkin lymphomas by the new approach termed Matrix-CGH M-CGH using genomic
  DNA microarrays as hybridization target. For M-CGH, a dedicated B-cell lymphoma
  chip was constructed containing 496 genomic targets covering oncogenes, tumor suppressor
  genes as well as chromosome regions frequently altered in B-NHL. In 10 of 16 samples
  a total of 15 DNA amplifications were identified. The amplicons included BCL2, REL,
  CCND1, CCND2, JAK2, FGF4 and MDM2. Four of the 15 amplifications remained undetected
  by chromosomal CGH. The respective amplicons mapped to bands 2p13, 9p13-p21 and
  12q24 and, were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Furthermore, for
  four genomically amplified genes real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
  chain reaction revealed elevated mRNA expression levels. These data show the superior
  diagnostic sensitivity of the newly developed diagnostic tool. As only a small portion
  of the genome approximately 1.5 has been analysed by the present DNA array, it is
  likely that gene amplifications are much more common in aggressive lymphomas than
  previously assumed.
