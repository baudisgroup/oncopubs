abstract: Deletion of chromosome 11q23 is a common alteration in parathyroid adenomas
  and hyperplasias. A new potential suppressor gene PPP2R1B encoding the beta isoform
  of the A subunit of the serine threorine protein phosphatase 2A was recently identified
  and localized to chromosome 11q23. We performed polymerase chain reaction-based
  single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing on six parathyroid
  hyperplasias and 12 adenomas to evaluate the role of PPP2R1B in the pathogenesis
  of parathyroid lesions. A previously identified germline G-A transition GGC-GAC
  in codon 90, changing glycine Gly to aspartic acid Asp , was detected in one adenoma.
  Both the common Gly allele and the variant Asp allele were detected by direct sequencing
  in the patients somatic cells. We conclude mutations of PPP2R1B are not frequent
  in parathyroid lesions, and that other genes located at 11q23 may be more closely
  associated with pathogenesis of parathyroid hyperplasia and adenoma.
