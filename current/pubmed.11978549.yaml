abstract: To investigate the chromosomal imbalances that occur in oral carcinoma associated
  primarily with betel use and their clinical implications, we performed chromosomal
  analysis using comparative genomic hybridization on 47 patients with this disease.
  The most common gains of chromosome arms were 8q, 9q and 11q, and the most frequent
  losses were of chromosomal arms 3p and 4q. The clinical parameters significantly
  associated with the numbers of chromosomal imbalances per tumor were the age of
  the patients and nodal metastasis. The preliminary findings of a lower incidence
  of loss of 4q and gain of 8q in betel-associated tumors compared to non-betel-associated
  tumors might provide insight into the carcinogenic effect of betel. Deletion of
  3p and the gain of 11q alterations were more prevalent in carcinomas with lymph
  node metastasis than in node-negative tumors, indicating possible loci for metastasis
  suppressor or metastasis enhancing genes, respectively. Losses of 3p and 4q and
  gain of 9q were associated with poor outcome for the patients. These data demonstrated
  that the frequent aberrations in 4q and 9q sites can be used as novel prognostic
  predictors.
