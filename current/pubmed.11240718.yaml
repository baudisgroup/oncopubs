abstract: Disturbed cell cycle-regulating checkpoints and impairment of genomic stability
  are key events during the genesis and progression of malignant tumors. We analyzed
  80 epithelial ovarian tumors of benign n 10 and borderline type n 18 in addition
  to carcinomas of early n 26 and advanced n 26 stages for the expression of Ki67,
  cyclin A and cyclin E, p21WAF-1, p27KIP-1 and p53 and correlated the results with
  the clinical course. Genomic instability was assessed by DNA ploidy measurements
  and, in 35 cases, by comparative genomic hybridization. Overexpression of cyclin
  A and cyclin E was observed in the majority of invasive carcinomas, only rarely
  in borderline tumors and in none of the benign tumors. Similarly, high expression
  of p53 together with undetectable p21 or loss of chromosome arm 17p were frequent
  events only in adenocarcinomas. Both borderline tumors and adenocarcinomas revealed
  a high number of chromosomal gains and losses. However, regional chromosomal amplifications
  were found to occur 13 times more frequently in the adenocarcinomas than in the
  borderline tumors. The expression pattern of low p27 together with high Ki67 was
  found to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in invasive carcinomas. The
  results provide a link between disturbed cell cycle regulatory proteins, chromosomal
  aberrations and survival in ovarian carcinomas.
