abstract: Individuals infected with HIV are at increased risk of developing aggressive
  non-Hodgkins lymphoma with a worse prognosis than those similarly afflicted without
  HIV infection. The underlying genetic differences in tumor behavior between these
  two groups are not known. We explored the hypothesis that lymphomas from HIV-positive
  individuals have distinct somatic genetic changes that may provide clues to the
  genetic basis of disease progression and outcome. Genome-wide DNA copy number alterations
  CNAs in primary tumors from 14 HIV-positive and 11 HIV-negative patients with diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma DLCL were quantified using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Tumors from HIV-positive patients displayed fewer regional DNA-CNAs than those
  from patients who did not have HIV. When CNAs were present, they occurred at lower
  frequency in HIV-positive patients. Gains at chromosomes 8q and Xp were the most
  frequent changes in the HIV-negative group, and gains on 2p and 12q were common
  in the combined HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups. No alteration was specific
  to AIDS-related DLCL. These data suggest that fewer somatic genomic changes are
  needed for progression to DLCL in HIV-immunocompromised hosts, and that other factors,
  such as reduced immune surveillance, may contribute to neoplastic progression.
