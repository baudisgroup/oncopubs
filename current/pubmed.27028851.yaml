abstract: Personalized medicine uses genomic information for selecting therapy in
  patients with metastatic cancer. An issue is the optimal tissue source (primary
  tumor or metastasis) for testing. We compared the DNA copy number and mutational
  profiles of primary breast cancers and paired metastases from 23 patients using
  whole-genome array-comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing
  of 365 "cancer-associated" genes. Primary tumors and metastases harbored copy number
  alterations (CNAs) and mutations common in breast cancer and showed concordant profiles.
  The global concordance regarding CNAs was shown by clustering and correlation matrix,
  which showed that each metastasis correlated more strongly with its paired tumor
  than with other samples. Genes with recurrent amplifications in breast cancer showed
  100% (ERBB2, FGFR1), 96% (CCND1), and 88% (MYC) concordance for the amplified/non-amplified
  status. Among all samples, 499 mutations were identified, including 39 recurrent
  (AKT1, ERBB2, PIK3CA, TP53) and 460 non-recurrent variants. The tumors/metastases
  concordance of variants was 75%, higher for recurrent (92%) than for non-recurrent
  (73%) variants. Further mutational discordance came from very different variant
  allele frequencies for some variants. We showed that the chosen targeted therapy
  in two clinical trials of personalized medicine would be concordant in all but one
  patient (96%) when based on the molecular profiling of tumor and paired metastasis.
  Our results suggest that the genotyping of primary tumor may be acceptable to guide
  systemic treatment if the metastatic sample is not obtainable. However, given the
  rare but potentially relevant divergences for some actionable driver genes, the
  profiling of metastatic sample is recommended.
