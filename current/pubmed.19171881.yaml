abstract: 'Wilms tumor 1 WT1 mutations have recently been identified in approximately
  10 of adult acute myeloid leukemia AML with normal cytogenetics CN-AML and are associated
  with poor outcome. Using array-based comparative genome hybridization in pediatric
  CN-AML samples, we detected a WT1 deletion in one sample. The other WT1 allele was
  mutated. This prompted us to further investigate the role of WT1 aberrations in
  childhood AML. Mutations were found in 35 of 298 12 diagnostic pediatric AML samples.
  In 19 of 35 54 samples, more than one WT1 aberration was found: 15 samples had 2
  different mutations, 2 had a homozygous mutation, and 2 had a mutation plus a WT1
  deletion. WT1 mutations clustered significantly in the CN-AML subgroup 22 P amp
  lt .001 and were associated with FLT3 ITD 43 vs 17 P amp lt .001 . WT1 mutations
  conferred an independent poor prognostic significance WT1 mutated vs wild-type patients:
  5-year probability of overall survival pOS 35 vs 66 , P .002 probability of event-free
  survival 22 vs 46 , P amp lt .001 and cumulative incidence of relapse or regression
  70 vs 44 , P amp lt .001 . Patients with both a WT1 mutation and a FLT3 ITD had
  a dismal prognosis 5-year pOS 21 . WT1 mutations occur at a significant rate in
  childhood AML and are a novel independent poor prognostic marker.'
