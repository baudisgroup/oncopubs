abstract: Multiple chromosome rearrangements MCRs are found in 5-10 of newly diagnosed
  patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML and 15-30 of patients with myelodysplastic
  syndromes MDS . However, the initial causes of MCRs and the molecular mechanisms
  involved are largely unresolved. Nor are the karyotypic patterns well studied, mainly
  because of the difficulties of obtaining complete karyotypes by G-banding. In this
  study, we applied spectral karyotyping SKY and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to investigate further the resulting chromosome imbalances and rearrangements
  in AML and MDS bone marrow cells with MCRs.
