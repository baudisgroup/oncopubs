abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD is a genetically heterogeneous
  disorder characterized by focal cyst formation from any part of the nephron. The
  molecular bases include germinal mutation of either PKD1 or PKD2 genes, enhanced
  expression of several protooncogenes, alteration of the TGF-alpha EGF EGF receptor
  EGFR axis, and disturbed regulation of proliferative apoptosis pathways. To identify
  new locations of ADPKD related oncogenes and or tumor suppressor genes TSG , comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and loss of heterozygosity LOH analyses were performed
  for a series of individual cysts n 24 from eight polycystic kidneys. By CGH, imbalances
  were detected predominantly on chromosomes 1p, 9q, 16p, 19, and 22q in all tissues.
  DNA copy number gain was seen on chromosomes 3q and 4q in five samples. The CGH
  data were supplemented by LOH analysis using 83 polymorphic microsatellite markers
  distributed along chromosomes 1, 9, 16, 19, and 22. The highest frequency of LOH
  was found on the 1p35-36 and 16p13.3 segments in cysts from seven samples. Allelic
  losses on 9q were detected in six, whereas deletions at 19p13 and 22q11 bands were
  observed in three polycystic kidneys. These results indicate that the deleted chromosomal
  regions may contain genes important in ADPKD initiation and progression.
