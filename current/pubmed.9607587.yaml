abstract: A combination of genetic and epigenetic factors may explain the disproportionate
  incidence and mortality of prostate cancer among African-American males AAMs as
  compared with Caucasian American males CAMs . We wished to determine whether primary
  prostate cancers from AAMs and CAMs harbor different patterns or frequencies of
  chromosomal alterations. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was performed on
  clinically localized, untreated primary prostate cancers from 16 AAMs and 16 CAMs.
  Detailed statistical analysis was used to delineate gains and deletions with high
  sensitivity and specificity and to compare the frequency and pattern of alterations
  between the two groups of tumors. The two groups of patients had indistinguishable
  preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and the two groups of tumors
  had similar pathological stages and grades. Chromosomal gains and deletions occurred
  in regions known to be frequently altered in prostate cancer. Specifically, the
  most frequent alterations were deletions of regions on chromosomes 13q, 5q, 16q,
  and 8p and gains of regions on 8q and 5q. When tumors from AAMs and CAMs were compared,
  the frequencies of alteration deletion, gain, or no alteration were similar across
  98.9 of the length of the genome. The patterns of alterations of the most frequently
  altered chromosomes were also similar between tumors from AAMs and CAMs. We concluded
  that primary prostate cancers from AAMs and CAMs harbor a similar pattern and frequency
  of chromosomal alterations. These data support the notion that sporadic prostate
  cancers from AAMs and CAMs develop by similar chromosomal mechanisms. Biological
  differences, if present, do not occur on the chromosomal level.
