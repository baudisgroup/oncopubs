abstract: The diagnosis of polycythemia vera PV is supported by the finding of an
  abnormal karyotype in patients with erythrocytosis. However, most PV patients have
  normal marrow cytogenetics at presentation and there is reluctance to use this test
  routinely. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a cytogenetic screening technique
  that analyzes interphase cells. This approach offers practical advantages over conventional
  cytogenetics and interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization IFISH . We have therefore
  evaluated the diagnostic utility of CGH applied to blood granulocytes in PV.
