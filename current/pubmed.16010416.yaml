abstract: 'A small number of human epithelioid sarcoma cell lines have been reported,
  but their characterization at a molecular cytogenetic level is not well known. In
  this study, a new permanent human cell line, FU-EPS-1, derived from a metastatic
  epithelioid sarcoma developing in the axillary lymph node of a 21-year-old man is
  described. This cell line was characterized by use of immunocytochemistry, conventional
  G-banding analysis, spectral karyotyping SKY and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . FU-EPS-1 cells were round, polygonal or spindle shaped with an abundant cytoplasm,
  and have been maintained continuously in vitro for over 100 passages during more
  than 15 months. Histologic features of the heterotransplanted tumors in severe combined
  immunodeficiency mice were essentially the same as those of the original tumor,
  revealing a multinodular proliferation of eosinophilic epithelioid and spindle cells.
  Both in vitro and in vivo, the cells were immunopositive for cytokeratins AE1 AE3
  and CAM5.2 , epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin and CD34, but were negative for
  desmin, S-100 protein, CD31 or factor VIII-related antigen. By G-banding and SKY
  analyses, FU-EPS-1 revealed a hyperdiploid karyotype with the following chromosomal
  abnormalities: i 5 p10 , -8, 13, der 13 t 8 13 q p11 , der 19 t 9 19  and del 22
  q13 . In addition, CGH analysis identified gains of 5p, 9q, 19q and 22q and a loss
  of 8p. This study demonstrates the value of molecular cytogenetic techniques such
  as SKY and CGH in defining genomic alterations in greater detail. The FU-EPS-1 cell
  line will be exceedingly useful for biologic and molecular pathogenetic studies
  of human epithelioid sarcoma.'
