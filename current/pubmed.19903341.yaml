abstract: We describe a method for automatic detection of absolute segmental copy
  numbers and genotype status in complex cancer genome profiles measured with single-nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The method is based on pattern recognition of segmented
  and smoothed copy number and allelic imbalance profiles. Assignments were verified
  by DNA indexes of primary tumors and karyotypes of cell lines. The method performs
  well even for poor-quality data, low tumor content, and highly rearranged tumor
  genomes.
