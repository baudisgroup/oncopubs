abstract: Splenic marginal zone lymphomas SMZL are an uncommon type of B-cell non-Hodgkins
  lymphoma NHL-B in which no specific chromosomal translocations have been described.
  In contrast, the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality is the loss of the long arm
  of chromosome 7 7q . Previous reports have located this loss in the 7q32 region.
  In order to better characterize the genomic imbalances in SMZL, molecular studies
  were carried out in 73 patients with SMZL. To gain insight into the mapping at 7q
  a tiling array was also used. The results confirmed the loss of 7q as the most frequent
  change. In addition, several abnormalities, including 4q22.1, 1q21.3-q22, 6q25.3,
  20q13.33, 3q28, 2q23.3-q24.1 and 17p13, were also present. A loss of 7q22.1 at 99925039-101348479
  bp was observed in half of the cases. The region of 7q22.1 has not previously been
  characterised in SMZL. Our results confirmed the presence of a new region of loss
  on chromosome 7 in these NHL.
