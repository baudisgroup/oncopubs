abstract: The analysis of exonic DNA from prostate cancers has identified recurrently
  mutated genes, but the spectrum of genome-wide alterations has not been profiled
  extensively in this disease. We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and
  matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they
  accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic
  rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise
  in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term "chromoplexy,"
  frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to
  disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy
  may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate
  cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By
  characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted
  a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis.
