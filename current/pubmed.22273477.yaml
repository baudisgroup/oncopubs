abstract: The development of cervical cancer and its high-grade precursor lesions
  Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 3 CIN2 3 result from a persistent infection
  with high-risk human papillomavirus hrHPV types and the accumulation of epi genetic
  host cell aberrations. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated variable CIN2 3
  and cancer risks between different hrHPV types. Recent genomic profiling studies
  revealed substantial heterogeneity in the chromosomal aberrations detected in morphologically
  indistinguishable CIN2 3 suggestive of varying cancer risk. The current study aimed
  to investigate whether CIN2 3 with different hrHPV types vary with respect to their
  chromosomal profiles, both in terms of the number of aberrations and chromosomal
  loci affected.
