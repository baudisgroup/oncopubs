abstract: 'We examined 14 spindle cell tumours of the pleura that were sent to a Mesothelioma
  Panel for re-evaluation after a primary suspicion of mesothelioma. The clinical,
  histological, immunohistochemical and CGH findings were investigated. Final diagnoses
  were eight sarcomatoid mesotheliomas SM and six non-mesotheliomas: two pulmonary
  sarcomatoid carcinomas, an epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a malignant solitary
  fibrous tumour, a malignant pleural smooth muscle tumour and an extraskeletal osteosarcoma.
  Seven of the eight SM and two of the other six tumours presented with unilateral
  pleural effusion, dyspnoea, and chest pain, which are characteristic clinical findings
  in malignant mesothelioma. No single antibody used in the immunohistochemistry separated
  SM from other tumour types. The most frequently observed chromosomal losses in SM
  were 4q, 4p11-p13 p15, 6q and 13. Losses of 4p11-p13 p15 and 4q occurred in combination
  in four out of five SM with detectable chromosomal changes, but neither was found
  in any of the other tumours. Gain or high-level amplification of 5p was also common
  in SM. According to our results and literature, losses at 4p, 4q and 9p and gain
  at 5p are the chromosomal changes that best differentiate SM from pleural sarcomas
  and lung carcinomas. CGH analysis may help distinguish a cytokeratin-positive SM
  from a sarcomatoid carcinoma. Similarly, in the case of a cytokeratin-negative tumour,
  CGH analysis may disclose chromosomal changes characteristic of sarcomas or mesotheliomas.'
