abstract: Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 ERCC1 is a protein involved
  in repair of DNA platinum adducts and stalled DNA replication forks. We and others
  have previously shown the influence of ERCC1 expression upon survival rates and
  benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with resected non-small-cell
  lung cancer NSCLC . However, little is known about the molecular characteristics
  of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors.
