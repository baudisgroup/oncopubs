abstract: Little is known of the molecular events underlying the genesis of pancreatoblastoma
  tumors in the pediatric population. Such studies have been limited by the rare nature
  of the disease, infrequent reports detailing cytogenetic alterations, and the lack
  of availability of cell lines for biologic studies. We present the isolation of
  a cell line from a 14-year-old boy with malignant pancreatoblastoma, and its cytogenetic
  characterization using spectral karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . The cytogenetic analysis revealed an exceedingly complex cytogenetic karyotype,
  with 33 aberrant chromosomes. CGH revealed multiple regions of chromosomal loss
  and gain, including a region on 8q gained in adult pancreatic cancers, one that
  frequently contains the MYC oncogene.
