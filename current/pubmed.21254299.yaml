abstract: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of bone UPSb is a rare tumor often
  difficult to differentiate from fibrosarcoma of bone FSb , diagnostically. We applied
  array comparative genomic hybridization array CGH to screen for genes with potential
  importance in the tumor and compared the results with alterations seen in FSb. Twenty-two
  fresh frozen tissue specimens from 20 patients 18 primary tumors and 4 local recurrences
  with UPSb were studied. DNA was isolated and hybridized onto Agilent 244K CGH oligoarrays.
  The hybridization data were analyzed using Agilent DNA Analytics Software. The number
  of changes ranged from 2 to 168 average 66 . Losses were most frequently seen at
  8p, 9p, 10, 13q, and 18q, and gains at 4q, 5p, 6p, 7p, 8q, 12p, 14q, 17q, 19p, 20q,
  22q, and X. Homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, RB1, TP53, and ING1 were seen in 8 20,
  7 20, 3 20, and 2 20 cases, respectively. Hypermethylation of both p16 INK4a and
  p14 ARF was found in two cases with loss at CDKN2A. Inactivation either of CDKN2A,
  RB1, or TP53 was detected in 18 20 cases. One case showed high level gains of CDK4
  and MDM2. Frequent gains were seen at MYC, PDGFRA, KIT, and KDR. Immunohistochemical
  positivity of KIT, PDGFRA, KDR, and PDGFRB was found in 8 14, 5 14, 4 14, and 4
  14 cases, respectively. The regions most significantly discriminating between UPSb
  and FSb included RB1 and MYC. No homozygous deletions of RB1 were found in FSb.
  In conclusion, our analysis showed the disruption of G1 S checkpoint regulation
  to be crucial for the oncogenesis of UPSb.
