abstract: Classic lobular carcinomas CLC account for 10 to 15 of all breast cancers.
  At the genetic level, CLCs show recurrent physical loss of chromosome16q coupled
  with the lack of E-cadherin CDH1 gene expression. However, little is known about
  the putative therapeutic targets for these tumors. The aim of this study was to
  characterize CLCs at the molecular genetic level and identify putative therapeutic
  targets.
