abstract: Endocrine pancreatic tumors EPTs are neoplasms with malignant potential.
  To explore the molecular basis of metastatic progression in human EPTs, we analyzed
  17 paired specimens of primary EPTs and their metastases and 28 nonmetastatic EPTs
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Genomic alterations were detected
  in all of the matched primary metastatic tumors and 19 58 nonmetastatic EPTs. The
  mean number of genomic changes was 17.3 in metastases, 12.5 in their primary tumors,
  and 4.5 in nonmetastatic EPTs. Statistical analysis of shared genomic changes in
  matched pairs of primary tumors and metastases showed a high probability amp gt
  95 of a clonal relationship in 15 of the 17 cases. A closely related genetic pattern
  was also demonstrated on the basis of concordance analysis of the two groups. The
  most striking genomic changes which were enriched in metastases included gains of
  chromosomes 4 and 7 and losses of 21q. Other common regions of frequent losses amp
  gt 40 identified in metastases and or their primary tumors involved 2p, 2q, 3p,
  3q, 6q, 10p, and 11p, whereas frequently detected gains amp gt 40 in the paired
  tumors involved 5p, 5q, 12q, 14q, 17q, 18q, and 20q. These chromosomal aberrations
  were found in significantly fewer nonmetastatic EPTs. Some of these chromosomal
  loci may harbor genes contributing to the progression of EPT.
