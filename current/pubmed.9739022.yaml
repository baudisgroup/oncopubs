abstract: 'DNA sequence copy number changes were studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in 28 desmoid tumors. Changes were detected in 12 tumors 43 with a mean of 1.4
  changes per sample range: 1 to 7 . Out of 12 tumors associated with pregnancy or
  Gardners syndrome, only two displayed changes. The minimal common regions of the
  most frequent gains were 1q21 39 , chromosome 20 32 , and 9p12 21 . No high-level
  amplifications were detected. Losses of DNA sequences were two times less frequent
  than gains and the minimal common regions of the most frequent losses were 6q16-q21
  14 , 5q14 11 , and 13q21-q31 11 .'
