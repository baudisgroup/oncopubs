abstract: Using array-based CGH, we identified 2p gain in 22 78 28 untreated Binet
  stages B C CLL, which was the second most frequent copy number change after 13q
  deletion. It never occurred as a sole abnormality and was associated with other
  changes 6q deletion 1p gain . The region of 2p gain frequently included two oncogenes,
  REL and MYCN. All patients with gain of REL were unmutated for IGHV p 0.03 . Gain
  of MYCN was associated with increased mRNA expression p 0.005 , suggesting a pathogenic
  role for MYCN. Gain of 2p appears to be a marker of progression and may contribute
  to the poor prognosis.
