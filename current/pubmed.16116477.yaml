abstract: DNA amplifications and deletions frequently contribute to the development
  and progression of lung cancer. To identify such novel alterations in small cell
  lung cancer SCLC , we performed comparative genomic hybridization on a set of 24
  SCLC cell lines, using cDNA microarrays representing approximately 22,000 human
  genes providing an average mapping resolution of amp lt 70 kb . We identified localized
  DNA amplifications corresponding to oncogenes known to be amplified in SCLC, including
  MYC 8q24 , MYCN 2p24 and MYCL1 1p34 . Additional highly localized DNA amplifications
  suggested candidate oncogenes not previously identified as amplified in SCLC, including
  the antiapoptotic genes TNFRSF4 1p36 , DAD1 14q11 , BCL2L1 20q11 and BCL2L2 14q11
  . Likewise, newly discovered PCR-validated homozygous deletions suggested candidate
  tumor-suppressor genes, including the proapoptotic genes MAPK10 4q21 and TNFRSF6
  10q23 . To characterize the effect of DNA amplification on gene expression patterns,
  we performed expression profiling using the same microarray platform. Among our
  findings, we identified sets of genes whose expression correlated with MYC, MYCN
  or MYCL1 amplification, with surprisingly little overlap among gene sets. While
  both MYC and MYCN amplification were associated with increased and decreased expression
  of known MYC upregulated and downregulated targets, respectively, MYCL1 amplification
  was associated only with the latter. Our findings support a role of altered apoptotic
  balance in the pathogenesis of SCLC, and suggest that MYC family genes might affect
  oncogenesis through distinct sets of targets, in particular implicating the importance
  of transcriptional repression.
