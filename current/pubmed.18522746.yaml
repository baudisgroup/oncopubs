abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNSTs are rare and highly aggressive
  soft tissue tumors showing complex chromosomal aberrations. In order to identify
  recurrent chromosomal regions of gain and loss, and thereby novel gene targets of
  potential importance for MPNST development and or progression, we have analyzed
  DNA copy number changes in seven high-grade MPNSTs using microarray-based comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH .
