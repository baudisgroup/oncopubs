abstract: Astrocytomas are brain tumors with variable responses to radiation and chemotherapy.
  Tumor grade and patient age are important prognostic factors but do not account
  for the variability in clinical outcome. We hypothesized that genetic subgroups
  play a role in the outcome of grade III astrocytomas and studied 80 grade III astrocytomas
  by comparative genomic hybridization. Some chromosomal aberrations 7p q, -9p, -10q,
  -13q, 19q were related to aberrations that are frequent in grade IV astrocytoma,
  whereas others 10p, -11q, 11p, -Xq were more frequent in grade III astrocytoma.
  7p, 19 and -4q were more frequent in tumors from older patients while -11p was more
  frequent in tumors from younger patients. Finally, gains of 7p and 7q were associated
  with shorter patient survival, independent of age. Our results indicate that genetic
  events underlie the well-known effects of age on survival in grade III astrocytoma
  and demonstrate the importance of molecular classification in astrocytic tumors.
