abstract: Papillary carcinomas are a special histological type of breast cancer and
  have a relatively good outcome. We characterized the genomic and phenotypic characteristics
  of papillary carcinomas to determine whether they would constitute an entity distinct
  from grade- and oestrogen receptor ER -matched invasive ductal carcinomas of no
  special type IDC-NSTs . The phenotype of 63 papillary carcinomas of the breast and
  grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs was determined by immunohistochemistry. DNA of sufficient
  quality was extracted from 49 microdissected papillary carcinomas and 49 microdissected
  grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs. These samples were subjected to high-resolution
  microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and Sequenom MassARRAY sequencing
  analysis of 19 known oncogenes. Papillary carcinomas were predominantly of low histological
  grade, expressed immunohistochemical markers consistent with a luminal phenotype,
  and a lower rate of lymph node metastasis and p53 expression than grade- and ER-matched
  IDC-NSTs. Papillary carcinomas displayed less genomic aberrations than grade- and
  ER-matched IDC-NSTs however, the patterns of gene copy number aberrations found
  in papillary carcinomas were similar to those of ER- and grade-matched IDC-NSTs,
  including 16q losses. Furthermore, PIK3CA mutations were found in 43 and 29 of papillary
  carcinomas and grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs, respectively. The genomic profiles
  of encapsulated, solid and invasive papillary carcinomas, the three morphological
  subtypes, were remarkably similar. Our results demonstrate that papillary carcinomas
  are a homogeneous special histological type of breast cancer. The similarities in
  the genomic profiles of papillary carcinomas and grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs
  suggest that papillary carcinomas may be best positioned as part of the spectrum
  of ER-positive breast cancers, rather than as a distinct entity. Furthermore, the
  good prognosis of papillary carcinomas may stem from the low rates of lymph node
  metastasis and p53 expression, low number of gene copy number aberrations and high
  prevalence of PIK3CA mutations.
