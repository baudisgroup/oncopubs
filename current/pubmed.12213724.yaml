abstract: Chromosomal imbalances were examined by comparative genomic hybridization
  in 30 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL at diagnosis, in sequential
  samples from 17 of these patients, and in 6 large B-cell lymphomas transformed from
  CLL Richters syndrome RS with no available previous sample. The most common imbalances
  in CLL at diagnosis were gains in chromosome 12 30 , and losses in chromosomes 13
  17 , 17p 17 , 8p 7 , 11q 7 , and 14q 7 . The analysis of sequential samples showed
  an increased number of chromosomal imbalances in 6 of 10 60 patients with clinical
  progression and in 2 patients with stable stage C disease. No karyotypic evolution
  was observed in four cases with stable stage A disease and in one RS clonally unrelated
  to the previous CLL. Gains of 2pter, and 7pter, and losses of 8p, 11q, and 17p were
  recurrent alterations associated with karyotype progression. RS showed a higher
  number of gains, losses, total alterations, and losses of 8p and chromosome 9 than
  CLL at diagnosis. 17p losses were associated with p53 gene mutations and with a
  significantly higher number of chromosomal imbalances than tumors with normal chromosome
  17 profile. However, no relationship was observed between 9p deletions and p16 INK4a
  gene alterations. Losses of 17p and an increased number of losses at diagnosis were
  significantly associated with a shorter survival. These findings indicate that CLL
  has frequent chromosomal imbalances, which may increase during the progression of
  the disease and transformation into large cell lymphoma. Genetic alterations detected
  by comparative genomic hybridization may also be of prognostic significance.
