abstract: A molecular cytogenetic study was performed on the diagnostic tumor sample
  and three relapses from a case with blastoid mantle cell lymphoma. The clonal relatedness
  of the tumors was demonstrated by identical rearrangements of the immunoglobulin
  heavy chain gene and was supported by results from comparative genomic hybridization
  analyses. All samples shared the common alterations of losses of 6q, 9p, and 11q
  and gains of 3q, 9q, 12p, and 13q, suggesting that they were relatively early events
  in the tumorigenesis. Relapse 1 also showed a loss of 8p, while relapses 2 and 3
  had gained the X chromosome and 7p, in addition, relapse 3 displayed gains of chromosomes
  3 and 20. Taken together, the findings suggest that relapses 2 and 3 developed from
  the diagnostic tumor sample, while relapse 1 represents a separate lineage of tumor
  progression originating directly from a postulated ancestral tumor cell carrying
  the common chromosomal alterations identified in all tumors.
