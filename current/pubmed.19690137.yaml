abstract: The contribution of microRNAs miR to the pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma
  MCL is not well known. We investigated the expression of 86 mature miRs mapped to
  frequently altered genomic regions in MCL in CD5 CD5 - normal B cells, reactive
  lymph nodes, and purified tumor cells of 17 leukemic MCL, 12 nodal MCL, and 8 MCL
  cell lines. Genomic alterations of the tumors were studied by single nucleotide
  polymorphism arrays and comparative genomic hybridization. Leukemic and nodal tumors
  showed a high number of differentially expressed miRs compared with purified normal
  B cells, but only some of them were commonly deregulated in both tumor types. An
  unsupervised analysis of miR expression profile in purified leukemic MCL cells revealed
  two clusters of tumors characterized by different mutational status of the immunoglobulin
  genes, proliferation signature, and number of genomic alterations. The expression
  of most miRs was not related to copy number changes in their respective chromosomal
  loci. Only the levels of miRs included in the miR-17-92 cluster were significantly
  related to genetic alterations at 13q31. Moreover, overexpression of miR-17-5p miR-20a
  from this cluster was associated with high MYC mRNA levels in tumors with a more
  aggressive behavior. In conclusion, the miR expression pattern of MCL is deregulated
  in comparison with normal lymphoid cells and distinguishes two subgroups of tumors
  with different biological features.
