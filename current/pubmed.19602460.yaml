abstract: Standard treatment of rectal cancer patients comprises preoperative chemoradiotherapy
  followed by radical surgery. However, clinicians are faced with the problem that
  response rates vary from one individual to another. Predictive biomarkers would
  therefore be helpful. To identify genomic imbalances that might assist in stratifying
  tumors into responsive or nonresponsive categories, we used metaphase comparative
  genomic hybridization to prospectively analyze pretherapeutic biopsies from 42 patients
  with locally advanced rectal cancers. These patients were subsequently treated with
  5-fluorouracil-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Based on downsizing of the
  T-category, 21 rectal cancers were later classified as responsive, while the other
  21 were nonresponsive. Comparing these two groups, we could show that gains of chromosomal
  regions 7q32 approximately q36 and 7q11 approximately q31, as well as amplifications
  of 20q11 approximately q13, were significantly associated with responsiveness to
  preoperative chemoradiotherapy P amp lt 0.05 . However, the probability of detecting
  these copy number changes by chance is high P 0.21 . Our primary results suggest
  that pretherapeutic evaluation of chromosomal copy number changes may be of value
  for response prediction of rectal cancers to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. This
  will require validation in a larger cohort of patients.
