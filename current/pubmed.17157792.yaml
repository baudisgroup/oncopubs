abstract: This study explores the roles of genome copy number abnormalities CNAs in
  breast cancer pathophysiology by identifying associations between recurrent CNAs,
  gene expression, and clinical outcome in a set of aggressively treated early-stage
  breast tumors. It shows that the recurrent CNAs differ between tumor subtypes defined
  by expression pattern and that stratification of patients according to outcome can
  be improved by measuring both expression and copy number, especially high-level
  amplification. Sixty-six genes deregulated by the high-level amplifications are
  potential therapeutic targets. Nine of these FGFR1, IKBKB, ERBB2, PROCC, ADAM9,
  FNTA, ACACA, PNMT, and NR1D1 are considered druggable. Low-level CNAs appear to
  contribute to cancer progression by altering RNA and cellular metabolism.
