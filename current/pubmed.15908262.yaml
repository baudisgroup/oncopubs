abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC of the salivary gland often has a variable
  clinical course with a poor prognosis. To investigate DNA copy number aberrations
  associated with ACCs, we compared comparative genome hybridization data from ACCs
  n 6 with other types of salivary gland tumors such as adenocarcinomas n 3 and pleomorphic
  adenomas n 6 . While 15 gain loci 1q32, 6p25, 6q21-q24, 7q11.2, 7q31, 10q11.2, 11p12-q12,
  12q13, 12q14, 13q24, 16p13.3-13.2, 18p11.3, 18q23, 19q13.4, and Xq28 were detected,
  no DNA loss locus was evident. To examine the expression status of genes on the
  ACC-associated loci, transcriptional measurements of approximately 38000 human genes
  then were monitored using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. A total of 4431 genes
  were found differentially expressed by at least two-fold between ACCs and normal
  salivary glands. Of them, 3162 genes were up-regulated and 1269 genes were down-regulated
  in ACCs. After obtaining locus information about the RNA transcripts from the Affymetrix
  database, we found 262 ACC-associated genes with increased expression on ACC-associated
  loci. To investigate functional network and gene ontology, the 262 genes were analyzed
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool. The function with the highest P value was
  a cancer-related function P 2.52e-4 to 4.71e-2 . In addition, we identified pituitary
  tumor-transforming gene 1 and transformation related protein 63 genes that were
  up-regulated by increasing DNA copy number and modulated expression of oncogenes.
  These results suggested that the combination of copy number and gene expression
  profiling provides an improved strategy for gene identification in salivary gland
  ACCs.
