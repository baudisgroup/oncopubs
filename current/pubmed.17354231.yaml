abstract: The order of appearance of different genetic aberrations during the shift
  from diploidy near-diploidy to aneuploidy in colorectal cancers is not yet clear.
  We studied genetic alterations in flow cytometrically-sorted DNA diploid and corresponding
  aneuploid epithelial cell populations from each of 20 colorectal tumors using comparative
  genomic hybridization, FISH, and PCR. Analysis of the 19 cases in which aberrations
  were found in the flow-sorted diploid population indicated that large-scale aneuploidization
  in colorectal cancer was preceded by amplification of oncogene s localized to chromosome
  20q13.2 and by KRAS mutations, but not by TP53 deletions or losses of large chromosomal
  regions such as 4q, 8p and 18q.
