abstract: The spectrum of entities, the therapeutic strategy, and the outcome of mature
  aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas maB-NHLs differs between children and adolescents
  on the one hand and adult patients on the other. Whereas adult maB-NHLs have been
  studied in detail, data on molecular profiling of pediatric maB-NHLs are hitherto
  lacking. We analyzed 65 cases of maB-NHL from patients up to 18 years of age by
  gene expression profiling, matrix comparative genomic hybridization CGH , fluorescent
  in situ hybridization FISH , and immunohistochemistry. The majority of the analyzed
  pediatric patients were treated within prospective trials n 49 . We compared this
  group to a series of 182 previously published cases of adult maB-NHL. Gene expression
  profiling reclassified 31 of morphologically defined diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
  as molecular Burkitt lymphoma mBL . The subgroups obtained by molecular reclassification
  did not show any difference in outcome in children treated with the NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster
  BFM protocols. No differences were detectable between pediatric and adult mBL with
  regard to gene expression or chromosomal imbalances. This is the first report on
  molecular profiling of pediatric B-NHL showing mBL to be much more prominent in
  children than suggested by morphologic assessment. Based on molecular profiling
  mBL is a molecularly homogeneous disease across children and adults.
