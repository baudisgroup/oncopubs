abstract: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas SCC are the second most commonly diagnosed
  cancers in fair-skinned people yet the genetic mechanisms involved in SCC tumorigenesis
  remain poorly understood. We have used single nucleotide polymorphism SNP microarray
  analysis to examine genome-wide allelic imbalance in 16 primary and 2 lymph node
  metastatic SCC using paired non-tumour samples to counteract normal copy number
  variation. The most common genetic change was loss of heterozygosity LOH on 9p,
  observed in 13 of 16 primary SCC. Other recurrent events included LOH on 3p 9 tumors
  , 2q, 8p, and 13 each in 8 SCC and allelic gain on 3q and 8q each in 6 tumors .
  Copy number-neutral LOH was observed in a proportion of samples, implying that somatic
  recombination had led to acquired uniparental disomy, an event not previously demonstrated
  in SCC. As well as recurrent patterns of gross chromosomal changes, SNP microarray
  analysis revealed, in 2 primary SCC, a homozygous microdeletion on 9p23 within the
  protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D PTPRD locus, an emerging frequent target
  of homozygous deletion in lung cancer and neuroblastoma. A third sample was heterozygously
  deleted within this locus and PTPRD expression was aberrant. Two of the 3 primary
  SCC with PTPRD deletion had demonstrated metastatic potential. Our data identify
  PTPRD as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in cutaneous SCC with a possible association
  with metastasis.
