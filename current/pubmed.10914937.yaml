abstract: Drug resistance is a major problem in chemotherapy of chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL . The genetic basis and molecular pathogenesis of drug resistance in
  CLL remain poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the association between
  chromosomal aberrations and cellular resistance of CLL cells against seven drugs,
  gamma and ultraviolet irradiation. Samples were obtained from 35 patients having
  a classical form of B-CLL. Chromosomal aberrations were first analyzed by traditional
  karyotyping improved by using optimized mitogen combinations. DNA sequence copy
  number changes throughout the genome were next screened by comparative genomic hybridization.
  Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect trisomy 12 and loss
  of Rb and deletions at chromosome 11. The cellular sensitivity in vitro was assessed
  by the reduction of macromolecular protein synthesis measured as incorporation of
  radioactive L-leucine as an endpoint. The overall analysis disclosed a statistically
  highly significant difference in cellular drug resistance between patients having
  at least three aberrations compared with patients with fewer or no aberrations.
  This strongly indicates that complex rather than simple molecular mechanisms are
  responsible for the drug and irradiation resistance in CLL. According to published
  results, complex aberrations are constantly associated with poor prognosis in CLL.
  We demonstrated here that complex chromosomal aberrations were associated with cellular
  irradiation and drug resistance, which, on the other hand, may be responsible for
  the poor clinical outcome in CLL.
