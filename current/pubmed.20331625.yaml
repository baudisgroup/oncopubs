abstract: We sought to identify genomic changes that could be useful for clinical
  application, focusing on chromosomal instability and using a high-density single
  nucleotide polymorphism SNP array. We analyzed 34 gastric cancer cell lines for
  areas of DNA that exhibited copy number changes using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human
  Mapping 50 K Arrays. The results obtained with the cell lines were verified in 42
  gastric cancer tissues using genomic PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and loss of
  heterozygosity LOH analyses. Twenty-six local homozygous deletion regions, including
  13 novel loci, and 31 recurrent high-grade gain regions, encompassing 14 novel loci,
  were found in the gastric cancer cell lines. Among the genes detected for high-grade
  gain in the cell lines, MYC, PAK1, and ITGB4BP showed copy number gain in more than
  40 of gastric cancer tissues. LOH of AB051467, PTPRD, A2BP1, and C20orf133 was detected
  in more than 35 of gastric cancer tissues. The number of LOH was significantly greater
  in tumors with lymph node metastasis. In the early stage, the prognosis of patients
  with LOH of less than two genes was significantly better than that of those with
  LOH of two genes or more. Using high-density SNP arrays, we identified several novel
  and minute genomic alterations. LOH of four genes could be useful for prediction
  of lymph node metastasis and prognosis in early stage gastric cancers.
