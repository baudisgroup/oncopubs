abstract: CpG island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a common
  hallmark of human cancer, and new large-scale epigenomic technologies might be useful
  in our attempts to define the complete DNA hypermethylome of tumor cells. Here,
  we report a functional search for hypermethylated CpG islands using the colorectal
  cancer cell line HCT-116, in which two major DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3b,
  have been genetically disrupted DKO cells . Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
  methodology in conjunction with promoter microarray analyses, we found that DKO
  cells experience a significant loss of hypermethylated CpG islands. Further characterization
  of these candidate sequences shows CpG island promoter hypermethylation and silencing
  of genes with potentially important roles in tumorigenesis, such as the Ras guanine
  nucleotide-releasing factor RASGRF2 , the apoptosis-associated basic helix-loop
  transcription factor BHLHB9 , and the homeobox gene HOXD1 . Hypermethylation of
  these genes occurs in premalignant lesions and accumulates during tumorigenesis.
  Thus, our results show the usefulness of DNMT genetic disruption strategies combined
  with methylated DNA immunoprecipitation in searching for unknown hypermethylated
  candidate genes in human cancer that might aid our understanding of the biology
  of the disease and be of potential translational use.
