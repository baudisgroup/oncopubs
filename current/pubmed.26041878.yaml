abstract: Optimal animal models of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are necessary
  to overcome the current lack of novel targeted therapies for this malignancy. Here
  we report on the establishment and characterization of patient-derived primary xenografts
  (PDX). Patient tumors were grafted under the renal capsule of mice and subsequently
  transplanted over multiple generations. Patient tumor and PDX were processed for
  analysis of copy number variations by aCGH, gene expression by microarray, and expression
  of target pathways by immunohistochemistry (IHC). One PDX harbouring an FGFR3 mutation
  was treated with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody targeting FGFR3. Five PDX were
  successfully established. Tumor doubling time ranged from 5 to 11 days. Array CGH
  revealed shared chromosomal aberrations in the patient tumors and PDX. Gene expression
  microarray and IHC confirmed that PDXs maintain similar patterns to the parental
  tumors. Tumor growth in the PDX with an FGFR3 mutation was inhibited by the FGFR3
  inhibitor. PDXs recapitulate the tumor biology of the patients' primary tumors from
  which they are derived. Investigations related to tumor biology and drug testing
  in these models are therefore more likely to be relevant to the disease state in
  patients. They represent a valuable tool for developing precision therapy in MIBC.
