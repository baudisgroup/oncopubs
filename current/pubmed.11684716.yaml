abstract: Comparative genomic hybridisation CGH is a reliable tool to gain an overview
  of all unbalanced chromosomal alterations within a tumour. Nevertheless, the high
  numbers of tumour cells required and the comparatively low resolution are drawbacks
  of this technique. Polymerase chain reaction PCR based multiplex microsatellite
  analysis represents a semi-automated, highly reproducible method, which requires
  small amounts of tumour cells. This is a comparative study of CGH and microsatellite
  analysis.
