abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive, malignant brain tumor typically resulting
  in death of the patient within one year following diagnosis; and those who survive
  beyond this point usually present with tumor recurrence within two years (5-year
  survival is 5%). The genetic heterogeneity of GBM has made the molecular characterization
  of these tumors an area of great interest and has led to identification of molecular
  subtypes in GBM. The availability of sequencing platforms that are both fast and
  economical can further the adoption of tumor sequencing in the clinical environment,
  potentially leading to identification of clinically actionable genetic targets.
  In this pilot study, comprised of triplet samples of normal blood, primary tumor,
  and recurrent tumor samples from three patients; we compared the ability of Illumina
  whole exome sequencing (ExomeSeq) and the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel
  (CCP) to identify somatic variants in patient-paired primary and recurrent tumor
  samples. Thirteen genes were found to harbor variants, the majority of which were
  exclusive to the ExomeSeq data. Surprisingly, only two variants were identified
  by both platforms and they were located within the PTCH1 and NF1 genes. Although
  preliminary in nature, this work highlights major differences in variant identification
  in data generated from the two platforms. Additional studies with larger samples
  sizes are needed to further explore the differences between these technologies and
  to enhance our understanding of the clinical utility of panel based platforms in
  genomic profiling of brain tumors.
