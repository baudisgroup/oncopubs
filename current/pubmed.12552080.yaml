abstract: DNA amplification in cancer cells frequently involves oncogenes whose increased
  expression confers a selective advantage on tumor cell growth. In an attempt to
  identify novel oncogenes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, representational difference
  analysis RDA was performed using DNA from a primary human hepatocellular carcinoma
  HCC that showed high-level DNA amplifications on chromosomes 1p32 and 11q13 by comparative
  genomic hybridization. Ten amplification fragments were isolated by RDA, and when
  used to probe Southern blots of tumor DNA, there was a 5- to 50-fold increase in
  hybridization intensity relative to normal DNA. The sequence of one amplification
  product matched that of the EMS1 oncogene, which is located on chromosome 11q13
  and is amplified in other cancers. We detected EMS1 amplification in 3 of 17 primary
  HCC. Overexpression of EMS1 mRNA was observed in 12 of 14 HCC cell lines in the
  absence of gene amplification or an increased copy-number of the gene. The EMS1
  gene encodes cortactin, a cortical actin-associated protein that is a substrate
  for Src kinase and is involved in cytoskeleton organization. Alterations of the
  EMS1 gene that lead to overexpression of cortactin may be associated with tumor
  development in HCC. EMS1 amplification and overexpresion is indicative of unfavorable
  prognosis in several cancers and may have similar prognostic implications in liver
  cancer.
