abstract: "Multidimensional genotyping of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
  samples has the potential to improve diagnostics and clinical trials for brain tumors,
  but prospective use in the clinical setting is not yet routine. We report our experience
  with implementing a multiplexed copy number and mutation-testing program in a diagnostic
  laboratory certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments.  We collected
  and analyzed clinical testing results from whole-genome array comparative genomic
  hybridization (OncoCopy) of 420 brain tumors, including 148 glioblastomas. Mass
  spectrometry-based mutation genotyping (OncoMap, 471 mutations) was performed on
  86 glioblastomas.  OncoCopy was successful in 99% of samples for which sufficient
  DNA was obtained (n = 415). All clinically relevant loci for glioblastomas were
  detected, including amplifications (EGFR, PDGFRA, MET) and deletions (EGFRvIII,
  PTEN, 1p/19q). Glioblastoma patients â\x89¤40 years old had distinct profiles compared
  with patients >40 years. OncoMap testing reliably identified mutations in IDH1,
  TP53, and PTEN. Seventy-seven glioblastoma patients enrolled on trials, of whom
  51% participated in targeted therapeutic trials where multiplex data informed eligibility
  or outcomes. Data integration identified patients with complete tumor suppressor
  inactivation, albeit rarely (5% of patients) due to lack of whole-gene coverage
  in OncoMap.  Combined use of multiplexed copy number and mutation detection from
  FFPE samples in the clinical setting can efficiently replace singleton tests for
  clinical diagnosis and prognosis in most settings. Our results support incorporation
  of these assays into clinical trials as integral biomarkers and their potential
  to impact interpretation of results. Limited tumor suppressor variant capture by
  targeted genotyping highlights the need for whole-gene sequencing in glioblastoma.
