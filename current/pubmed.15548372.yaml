abstract: To investigate the genomic aberrations that are involved in lung tumorigenesis
  and therefore may be developed as biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis, we characterized
  the genomic copy number changes associated with individual genes in 14 tumors from
  patients with primary non small cell lung cancer NSCLC . Six squamous cell carcinomas
  SQCAs and eight adenocarcinomas ADCAs were examined by high-resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH analysis of cDNA microarray. The SQCAs and ADCAs shared
  common frequency distributions of recurrent genomic gains of 63 genes and losses
  of 72 genes. Cluster analysis using 57 genes defined the genomic differences between
  these two major histologic types of NSCLC. Genomic aberrations from a set of 18
  genes showed distinct difference of primary ADCAs from their paired normal lung
  tissues. The genomic copy number of four genes was validated by fluorescence in
  situ hybridization of 32 primary NSCLC tumors, including those used for cDNA microarray
  CGH analysis a strong correlation with cDNA microarray CGH data emerged. The identified
  genomic aberrations may be involved in the initiation and progression of lung tumorigenesis
  and, most importantly, may be developed as new biomarkers for the early detection
  and classification of lung cancer.
