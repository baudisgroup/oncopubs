abstract: Genomic alterations are important events in the origin and progression of
  various cancers, with DNA copy number changes associated with progression and treatment
  response in cancer. Array CGH is potentially useful in the identification of genomic
  alterations from primary tumor and blood in breast cancer patients. The aim of our
  study was to compare differences of DNA copy number changes in blood and tumor tissue
  in breast cancer.
