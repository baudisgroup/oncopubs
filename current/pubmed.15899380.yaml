abstract: In order to characterize the chromosomal alterations in ameloblastomas,
  a combination of comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH techniques was performed on 9 tumors. Chromosomal alterations
  including a gain at 1q and losses at 1pter, 10q, and 22q could be detected by CGH
  only in 1 tumor. Interphase FISH analysis, using centromeric probes for chromosomes
  1, 10, and 22 as well as region-specific probes for 1p36 and 10q26, revealed the
  most frequent alterations to exist in the tumor with the abnormal CGH profile. These
  alterations included marked to slight increases of monosomic cells for chromosome
  10 91.5 , 10q26 35.8 , 1p36 24.4 , and chromosome 22 18.8 , as well as significant
  elevations of trisomic cells for chromosome 1 41.2 . Moreover, FISH analysis revealed
  a frequent loss of chromosome 22 in all tumors examined, except for one lesion,
  indicating that loss of the entire or a part of this chromosome is a common event
  in ameloblastomas, possibly being a predisposing factor to ameloblastoma tumorigenesis.
