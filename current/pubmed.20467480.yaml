abstract: Genetic and epigenetic alterations in colorectal cancer are numerous. However,
  it is difficult to judge whether such changes are primary or secondary to the appearance
  and progression of tumors. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify
  altered DNA regions with significant covariation to transcription alterations along
  colon cancer progression.
