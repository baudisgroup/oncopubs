abstract: Several lines of evidences suggest that T cell histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma
  T HRBCL represents an aggressive variant of the clinically indolent entity nodular
  lymphocyte predominance Hodgkins lymphoma LPHL . Still, this view has not yet been
  supported by firm genetic evidence. In this study, we analyzed 17 T HRBCL cases
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH combined with microdissection of single
  CD20 neoplastic cells and DNA amplification by degenerate oligonucleotide primed-polymerase
  chain reaction, an approach we previously used in LPHL. Genomic imbalances were
  detected in all cases in total, 80 changes . The most common imbalances included
  gain of Xq, 4q13q28, Xp21p11, and 18q21, and loss of 17p. Of note, a partial gain
  of 4q, a rare change in lymphoma, is also among the genomic imbalances most frequently
  encountered in LPHL. On the other hand, the CGH profiles of T HRBCL and LPHL showed
  several distinct features, in particular with respect to the number of genomic imbalances
  average of 4.7 in T HRBCL versus 10.8 in LPHL and their distribution usually 1 to
  5 in T HRBCL versus 6 to 22 in LPHL . Altogether, our CGH findings of shared as
  well as distinctive cytogenetic features in both diseases suggest that T HRBCL constitutes
  a separate lymphoma entity, possibly originating from the same precursor cell as
  LPHL.
