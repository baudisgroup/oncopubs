abstract: The amplification or gain of the p-arm of chromosome 17 is common in sarcomas,
  suggesting its role in carcinogenesis. Here, we report the architectural structure
  and targets of 17p aberrations commonly shared by osteosarcoma OS , leiomyosarcoma
  LMS and malignant fibrous histiocytoma MFH of soft tissue. Two low-grade and two
  high-grade soft tissue LMS, three OS, and two MFH samples were studied using fine-resolution
  oligonucleotide-based microarray comparative genomic hybridization. Eight of the
  nine samples showed a loss of 17pter-- amp gt p13, the locus of tumor suppressor
  TP53 preceding the amplified area 17p12-- amp gt p11.2. The size and detailed architecture
  of the amplified region of 17p differed between the studied sarcoma entities. OS
  and high-grade LMS showed similar complex patterns of discontinuous amplifications
  with regions of gain in between. MFH and low-grade LMS showed continuous regions
  of gains and amplifications. Precise boundaries of the lost or gained regions were
  determined, and in addition to the previously suggested targets of the region, ELAC
  and FLCN were amplified in all the sarcoma entities.
