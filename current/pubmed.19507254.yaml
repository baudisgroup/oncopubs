abstract: A consistent feature of the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg HRS cells in classical
  Hodgkin lymphoma cHL is the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB transcription factors.
  In Epstein-Barr virus EBV -associated cases of cHL, expression of viral antigens
  most probably leads to NF-kappaB activation but for non-EBV-associated cases, the
  mechanism is not clear. Previous small studies have demonstrated deleterious mutations
  of NFKBIA, the gene encoding IkappaB alpha, in HRS cells. In the present study,
  we aimed to establish the frequency of NFKBIA mutation in cHL by investigating a
  larger series of cases and to determine whether these mutations are a characteristic
  feature of non-EBV-associated cHL. Single HRS cells from 20 cases of cHL were analysed
  by PCRs covering all 6 exons of the gene. Clonal deleterious mutations were detected
  in 3 cases and in 1 case both alleles of the gene were shown to harbour mutations.
  NFKBIA mutations were detected only in non-EBV-associated cases but the majority
  of these cases had wild-type NFKBIA. It remains possible that defects in genes encoding
  other inhibitors of NF-kappaB, such as TNFAIP3 A20 and CYLD, are involved in the
  latter cases, as described for one case in this series.
