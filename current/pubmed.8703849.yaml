abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was used to screen the DNA extracted from
  histologically defined tissue sections from consecutive stages of colorectal carcinogenesis
  for chromosomal aberrations. No aberrations were detected in normal epithelium n
  14 . Gain of chromosome 7 occurred as a single event in low-grade adenomas n 14
  . In high-grade adenomas n 12 , and overrepresentation of chromosomes 7 and 20 was
  present in 30 of the cases analyzed. The transition to colon carcinomas n 16 was
  characterized by the emergence of multiple chromosomal aberrations. Chromosomes
  1, 13, and 20 and chromosome arms 7p and 8q were frequently gained, whereas chromosome
  4 and chromosome arms 8p and 18q were recurrently underrepresented. The same tissue
  sections that were used for CGH were analyzed by means of DNA-ploidy measurements
  and immunohistochemical staining to quantify proliferative activity and p21 WAF-1
  and TP53 expression. We observed that crude aneuploidy and increased proliferative
  activity are early events in colorectal carcinogenesis, followed by TP53 overexpression
  and the acquisition of recurrent chromosomal gains and losses during the progression
  from high-grade adenomas to invasive carcinomas.
