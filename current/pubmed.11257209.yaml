abstract: Proto-oncogene MYC, mapped to chromosomal band 8q24 and the genes for hepatocyte
  growth factor HGF at 7q21 and its receptor, MET, at chromosomal band 7q31, have
  an important role in the biology and growth of normal and neoplastic liver. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH studies have
  reported frequent abnormalities of chromosomes 1 and 8 in hepatocellular carcinomas
  HCCs of various clinical and pathological stages. Chromosome 7 involvement is reported
  to be less frequent.
