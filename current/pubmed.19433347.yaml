abstract: Richters transformation RT is the development of a high-grade lymphoma in
  patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma CLL
  SLL . We report an extremely rare case with paraimmunoblastic transformation. A
  78-year-old Taiwanese male had Rai stage 1 and Binet stage B CLL SLL involving skin,
  peripheral blood PB , and bone marrow BM with paraimmunoblastic transformation in
  the lymph node. Molecular genomic studies showed the same clonal origin of tumor
  tissues at various locations with trisomy 12 and a deletion of chromosome 13q14.
  Interestingly, there seemed to be no additional chromosomal aberrations in the transformed
  nodal tissue, suggesting that the micro-environment rather than an additional genetic
  lesion contributed to the transformation. The patient received chemotherapy and
  was alive with disease after 33.5 months.
