abstract: Hepatocellular carcinomas represent the third leading cause of cancer-related
  deaths worldwide. The vast majority of cases arise in the context of chronic liver
  injury due to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. To identify genetic
  mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, we characterized copy number alterations and
  gene expression profiles from the same set of tumors associated with hepatitis C
  virus. Most tumors harbored 1q gain, 8q gain, or 8p loss, with occasional alterations
  in 13 additional chromosome arms. In addition to amplifications at 11q13 in 6 of
  103 tumors, 4 tumors harbored focal gains at 6p21 incorporating vascular endothelial
  growth factor A VEGFA . Fluorescence in situ hybridization on an independent validation
  set of 210 tumors found 6p21 high-level gains in 14 tumors, as well as 2 tumors
  with 6p21 amplifications. Strikingly, this locus overlapped with copy gains in 4
  of 371 lung adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of VEGFA via 6p21 gain in hepatocellular
  carcinomas suggested a novel, non-cell-autonomous mechanism of oncogene activation.
  Hierarchical clustering of gene expression among 91 of these tumors identified five
  classes, including amp quot CTNNB1 amp quot , amp quot proliferation amp quot ,
  amp quot IFN-related amp quot , a novel class defined by polysomy of chromosome
  7, and an unannotated class. These class labels were further supported by molecular
  data mutations in CTNNB1 were enriched in the amp quot CTNNB1 amp quot class, whereas
  insulin-like growth factor I receptor and RPS6 phosphorylation were enriched in
  the amp quot proliferation amp quot class. The enrichment of signaling pathway alterations
  in gene expression classes provides insights on hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis.
  Furthermore, the prevalence of VEGFA high-level gains in multiple tumor types suggests
  indications for clinical trials of antiangiogenic therapies.
