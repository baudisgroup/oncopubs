abstract: 'Both ulcerative colitis UC -related and sporadic colorectal cancers are
  thought to evolve through a multistep process of genomic instability, accumulation
  of genomic alterations, and clonal expansion. This process may involve different
  genomic changes in UC-related cancers than in sporadic cancers because of the origin
  of UC-related cancers in an inflammatory field. This study was designed to define
  the specific genomic events occurring in UC-related cancers. Comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH was performed on 32 UC-related and 42 stage-matched sporadic colorectal
  cancers. The mean number of chromosomal alterations per case was similar in the
  UC-related and sporadic tumor groups 8.6 in UC, 8.1 in sporadic . The 2 tumor groups
  shared many chromosomal alterations: losses on 18q 78 UC v69 sporadic , 8p 53 v50
  , 17p 44 v57 , and gains on 8q 63 v45 , 20q 44 UC v67 , and 13q 44 UC v38 . However,
  differences in the frequency and timing of specific alterations were observed. Chromosome
  5q was lost in 56 of UC-related but in only 26 of sporadic cancers. Alterations
  of chromosome 8 were associated with stage progression in UC-related, but not in
  sporadic cancers. In contrast, 18q loss was associated with stage progression in
  sporadic cancers only. Thus, differences in the frequency and timing of individual
  chromosomal alterations suggest that genetic progression in these 2 tumor groups
  may follow multiple pathways.'
