abstract: 'Primary central nervous system neoplasms are the most common solid tumors
  in children. Genetic changes underlying childhood brain-tumor development and progression
  are incompletely characterized. To get an overview of the genetic events leading
  to the development of brain tumors and to identify chromosomal regions that may
  contain genes important in brain-tumor progression, we employed a comparative genomic
  hybridization technique. Twenty-four pediatric primary brain tumors were analyzed
  in this study. DNA copy number changes were observed in most of the samples 79 ,
  and almost all chromosomes were involved. The total number of genetic aberrations
  copy-number gains and losses per tumor was significantly higher in the cerebellar
  primitive neuroectodermal tumor subgroup than in the gliomas. The high-grade tumors
  had more DNA changes than did the low-grade tumors. The most often gained chromosomes
  were: 6q 45 , 4q 34.5 , and chromosome 1 24 of the cases . The minimal common regions
  involved in DNA gains were narrowed down to 6q14-16 and 4q26-28. Losses of a specific
  chromosome partly or as a whole occurred on average in 7 of the cases. Chromosomal
  regions that were most often lost included chromosome 1 17 , chromosome 16 17 ,
  and chromosome 2 14 . These findings suggest that genes localized to these minimal
  common chromosomal regions play a role in the tumorogenesis of childhood brain tumors.
  Our results indicate: 1 a great degree of genomic imbalance in these tumors 2 that
  a high number of aberrations correlate with aggressive tumor biology 3 and that
  nonrandom genetic changes may be associated with particular tumor types.'
