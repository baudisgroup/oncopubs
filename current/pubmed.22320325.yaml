abstract: The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a multistep process
  that requires the accumulation of genetic alterations. To identify genes responsible
  for OSCC development, we performed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array
  analysis and genome-wide gene expression profiling on OSCC tumors. These analyses
  indicated that the absent in melanoma 2 AIM2 gene and the interferon-inducible gene
  16 IFI16 mapped to the hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear proteins. The
  200-amino-acid repeat gene cluster in the amplified region of chromosome 1q23 is
  overexpressed in OSCC. Both AIM2 and IFI16 are cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA sensors
  for innate immunity and act as tumor suppressors in several human cancers. Knockdown
  of AIM2 or IFI16 in OSCC cells results in the suppression of cell growth and apoptosis,
  accompanied by the downregulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
  activated B cells activation. Because all OSCC cell lines have reduced p53 activity,
  wild-type p53 was introduced in p53-deficient OSCC cells. The expression of wild-type
  p53 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis via suppression of nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells activity. Finally, the co-expression
  of AIM2 and IFI16 significantly enhanced cell growth in p53-deficient cells in contrast,
  the expression of AIM2 and or IFI16 in cells bearing wild-type p53 suppressed cell
  growth. Moreover, AIM2 and IFI16 synergistically enhanced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells signaling in p53-deficient cells. Thus, expression of AIM2
  and IFI16 may have oncogenic activities in the OSCC cells that have inactivated
  the p53 system.
