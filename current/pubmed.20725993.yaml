abstract: We analyzed, by the latest high-resolution SNP arrays, 19 Normal Karyotype
  NK -AML patients at diagnosis Dx and remission R phases, to determine the number
  of tumor-associated copy number abnormalities CNAs and copy neutral-loss of heterozygosity
  CN-LOH regions per patient and to identify possible recurring genomic abnormalities.
  The number of tumor-associated CNAs was determined after comparison of matched Dx
  R samples using stringent conditions able to reduce the number of false positive
  CNAs. With the exception of a single outlier case, a low number of CNAs per patient
  was detected median value of 1 somatic loss or gain per patient . However, a high
  prevalence of CNAs 60-70 of the patients showed at least one tumor-associated gain
  or loss and few recurring CNAs were observed, thus providing new hints towards identification
  of cooperating mutations. An extensive search of all tumor-associated CN-LOH regions
  amp gt 1 Mb revealed only three broad regions terminal 12Mb of 22q, terminal 27Mb
  of 1p and the whole chromosome 21 in three patients out of 19 16 . CN-LOH of the
  whole chromosome 21 was responsible for homozygosity of a missense mutation R80C
  of RUNX1 AML1. Our study suggests that a relative submicroscopic copy number stability
  NK-AML genomes is associated with low recurrence of specific CNAs and CN-LOH in
  NK-AML patient population. Sequencing of candidate genes in the identified CNAs
  and CN-LOH regions should be considered a priority in the search of novel driver
  mutations of AML.
