abstract: Chromosomal imbalances were analyzed in 62 breast cancers with different
  DNA ploidy by CGH. The results of DNA image cytometry and CGH are consistent with
  peridiploid and aneuploid cases. The peritetraploid tumors harbored a high number
  of chromosomal imbalances, as a hint for an unfavorable prognosis. The quantitative
  analysis of imbalances highlighted the role of different physical constituents of
  the chromosome, and of chromosomal losses in different DNA ploidy groups. The peritetraploid
  and aneuploid tumors differed from the peridiploid tumors in losses at 8p and 18q.
  The peritetraploid cancers exhibited more gains at 8q, the aneuploid tumors more
  losses at 17p than their peridiploid counterparts. The aneuploid cases differed
  from the peritetraploid tumors in a higher number of losses at 11q and 14q. Combinations
  of imbalances provide further insights into the genetic background of DNA ploidy.
  Hypotheses for the progression from peridiploid to nondiploid breast cancers are
  given.
