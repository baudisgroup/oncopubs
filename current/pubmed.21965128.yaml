abstract: In this study, we established and analyzed a novel human myeloid leukemia
  cell line, AMU-AML1, from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage
  dysplasia before the initiation of chemotherapy. AMU-AML1 cells were positive for
  CD13, CD33, CD117, and HLA-DR by flow cytometry analysis and showed a single chromosomal
  abnormality, 46, XY, t 12 22 p13 q11.2 , by G-banding and spectral karyotyping.
  Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the chromosomal breakpoint
  in band 12p13 was in the sequence from the 5 untranslated region to intron 1 of
  TEL and that the chromosomal breakpoint in band 22q11 was in the 3 untranslated
  region of MN1. The chimeric transcript and protein of MN1-TEL could not be detected
  by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis. However,
  the MN1 gene was amplified to three copies detected by array comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis, and the expression levels of the MN1 transcript and protein
  were high in AMU-AML1 cells when compared with other cell lines with t 12 22 p13
  q11-12 . Our data showed that AMU-AML1 cells contain t 12 22 p13 q11.2 without chimeric
  fusion of MN1 and TEL. The AMU-AML1 cells gained MN1 copies and had high expression
  levels of MN1. Thus, the AMU-AML1 cell line is useful for studying the biological
  consequences of t 12 22 p13 q11.2 lacking chimeric MN1-TEL.
