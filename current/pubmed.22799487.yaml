abstract: Familial adenomatous polyposis FAP is a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome
  caused by a loss of function of the APC gene. Large deletions in APC are a common
  cause of FAP despite the existence of a variety of gene dosage detection methodologies,
  most are labor intensive and time and resource consuming.
