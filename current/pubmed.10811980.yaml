abstract: Hematopoietic disorders can be used as a suitable tool of additional information
  on the actual resolving power of comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Therefore,
  CGH examination was performed of DNA extracted from 23 acute and 15 chronic myeloproliferative
  disorders which had just been analyzed using classical cytogenetic techniques. In
  nearly all cases CGH analysis was repeated with reversely labeled probes. A Zeiss
  axioplan microscope was equipped with the ISIS 3 system for photometric evaluation
  of the CGH data. A main group was selected of 34 cases showing karyotypic mosaics
  when routinely diagnosed by classical cytogenetics. The grade of mosaicism was basically
  determined from the classical cytogenetic analysis and was additionally defined
  examining target anomalies by I-FISH analysis in 28 of the cases. The second group
  included 23 cases with deletions, and in 1 case another informative genomic imbalance
  could be analyzed. Every target anomaly irrespective of its type could be detected
  in all cases with an affected cell population equalling or exceeding about 25 ,
  but in none was it below 23 . This value was the lowest and was found in a case,
  with CGH-detected 20q deletion. The smallest deletions of two bands on 20q which
  could visually be detected by CGH were estimated in the range of 5-7 Mb. CGH was
  also suitable to detect imbalances which were not clearly detected by routine cytogenetics.
  Reverse labelling, performed in nearly all cases, confirmed the result of the original
  CGH analysis. These data not only document the readiness and reliability of CGH
  studies on human leukemia, but also further contribute to a clearer definition of
  the limits of the resolving power of this technique.
