abstract: Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma MIFS is a rare low-grade sarcoma of
  the distal extremities characterized by a myxohyaline stroma, a dense inflammatory
  infiltrate and virocyte- and lipoblast-like giant cells. Up to now, only two cases
  have been investigated cytogenetically, showing complex and heterogeneous karyotypes,
  in part with supernumerary ring chromosomes. We characterized two further cases
  of MIFS immunohistochemically and performed comparative genomic hybridization as
  well as DNA image cytometry analyses. Both tumors showed the characteristic histomorphological
  pattern of MIFS and were positive for Vimentin and CD68. Moreover, both cases presented
  aberrant karyotypes including distinct DNA copy number changes involving chromosome
  7 and disclosed DNA aneuploidy.
