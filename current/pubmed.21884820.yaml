abstract: Alterations of BRAF are the most common known genetic aberrations in pediatric
  gliomas. They frequently are found in pilocytic astrocytomas, where genomic duplications
  involving BRAF and the poorly characterized gene KIAA1549 create fusion proteins
  with constitutive B-Raf kinase activity. BRAF V600E point mutations are less common
  and generally occur in nonpilocytic tumors. The development of BRAF inhibitors as
  drugs has created an urgent need for robust clinical assays to identify activating
  lesions in BRAF. KIAA1549-BRAF fusion transcripts have been detected in frozen tissue,
  however, methods for FFPE tissue have not been reported. We developed a panel of
  FFPE-compatible quantitative RT-PCR assays for the most common KIAA1549-BRAF fusion
  transcripts. Application of these assays to a collection of 51 low-grade pediatric
  gliomas showed 97 sensitivity and 91 specificity compared with fluorescence in situ
  hybridization or array comparative genomic hybridization. In parallel, we assayed
  samples for the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation by PCR pyrosequencing. The data
  further support previous observations that these two alterations of the BRAF, KIAA1549
  fusions and V600E point mutations, are associated primarily with pilocytic astrocytomas
  and nonpilocytic gliomas, respectively. These results show that fusion transcripts
  and mutations can be detected reliably in standard FFPE specimens and may be useful
  for incorporation into future studies of pediatric gliomas in basic science or clinical
  trials.
