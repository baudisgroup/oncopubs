abstract: We investigated characteristics of germline copy number variations CNV in
  BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer patients by comparing them to CNVs present in sporadic
  ovarian cancer patients. Germline CNVs in 51 BRCA1-associated, 33 sporadic ovarian
  cancer patients, and 47 healthy women were analyzed by both signal intensity and
  genotyping data using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. The total
  number of CNVs per genome was greater in the sporadic group median 26, range 12-34
  than in the BRCA1 group median 21, range 11-35 post hoc P amp lt 0.05 or normal
  group median 20, range 7-32 post hoc P amp lt 0.05 . While the number of amplifications
  per genome was higher in the sporadic group median 13, range 7-26 than in the BRCA1
  group median 8, range 3-23 post hoc P amp lt 0.001 , the number of deletions per
  genome was higher in the BRCA1 group median 12, range 6-24 than in the sporadic
  group median 9, range 3-17 post hoc P amp lt 0.01 . In addition, 31 previously unknown
  CNV regions were present specifically in the BRCA1 group. When we performed pathway
  analysis on the 241 overlapping genes mapped to these novel CNV regions, the purine
  metabolism and 14-3-3-mediated signaling pathways were over-represented Fishers
  exact test, P amp lt 0.01 . Our study shows that there are qualitative differences
  in genomic CNV profiles between BRCA1-associated and sporadic ovarian cancer patients.
  Further studies are necessary to clarify the significance of the genomic CNV profile
  unique to BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer patients.
