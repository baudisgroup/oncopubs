abstract: The B cell-specific transcription factor BACH2 is required for affinity
  maturation of B cells. Here we show that Bach2-mediated activation of p53 is required
  for stringent elimination of pre-B cells that failed to productively rearrange immunoglobulin
  VH-DJH gene segments. After productive VH-DJH gene rearrangement, pre-B cell receptor
  signaling ends BACH2-mediated negative selection through B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6)-mediated
  repression of p53. In patients with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the BACH2-mediated
  checkpoint control is compromised by deletions, rare somatic mutations and loss
  of its upstream activator, PAX5. Low levels of BACH2 expression in these patients
  represent a strong independent predictor of poor clinical outcome. In this study,
  we demonstrate that Bach2(+/+) pre-B cells resist leukemic transformation by Myc
  through Bach2-dependent upregulation of p53 and do not initiate fatal leukemia in
  transplant-recipient mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and gene expression
  analyses carried out by us revealed that BACH2 competes with BCL6 for promoter binding
  and reverses BCL6-mediated repression of p53 and other cell cycle checkpoint-control
  genes. These findings identify BACH2 as a crucial mediator of negative selection
  at the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint and a safeguard against leukemogenesis.
