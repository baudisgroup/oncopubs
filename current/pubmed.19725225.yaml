abstract: Telomerase is a specialized cellular reverse transcriptase that adds telomeric
  repeats TTAGGG at the ends of each chromosome. Nearly the complete spectrum of human
  cancers has been shown to be telomerase positive. The understanding of the telomerase
  regulation in concert with other genetic alterations in the process of malignant
  transformation of human cells has important clinical and practical implications.
  Regulation of telomerase activity TA is highly complex, and both putative positive
  and negative regulators have been reported. However, the mechanisms involved in
  telomerase regulation are not fully established. Identification of additional telomerase
  components and associated proteins will certainly contribute to further investigations
  of the effect of telomerase in telomere elongation, telomere length maintenance,
  oncogenesis, and functionally new, unidentified cellular functions. In this study
  our aim was to determine the chromosomal localizations of putative unidentified
  telomerase activator s and or repressor s by high resolution-comparative genomic
  hybridization HR-CGH in highly telomerase expressing gastric tumor samples. For
  this purpose TAs and genomic imbalances were identified in the same tumor samples
  and relation between these was evaluated. Genomic changes affecting telomerase activity
  in 50 gastric tumor samples were investigated by HR-CGH. We have found that genomic
  imbalances including 1q , 8p , 8q , 10q , 17p-, and 20p are associated with the
  higher telomerase activity. Our results suggest that 1q24, 8p21-p11.2, 8q21.1-q23,
  10q21-qter and 20pter-p11.2 may contain putative telomerase activator s , whereas
  the 17p12 region may harbor candidate telomerase suppressor s .
