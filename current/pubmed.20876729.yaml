abstract: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma SCC occurs commonly and can metastasize.
  Identification of specific molecular aberrations and mechanisms underlying the development
  and progression of cutaneous SCC may lead to better prognostic and therapeutic approaches
  and more effective chemoprevention strategies. To identify genetic changes associated
  with early stages of cutaneous SCC development, we analyzed a series of 40 archived
  skin tissues ranging from normal skin to invasive SCC. Using high-resolution array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization, we identified deletions of a region on chromosome
  10q harboring the INPP5A gene in 24 of examined SCC tumors. Subsequent validation
  by immunohistochemistry on an independent sample set of 71 SCC tissues showed reduced
  INPP5A protein levels in 72 of primary SCC tumors. Decrease in INPP5A protein levels
  seems to be an early event in SCC development, as it also is observed in 9 of 26
  35 examined actinic keratoses, the earliest stage in SCC development. Importantly,
  further reduction of INPP5A levels is seen in a subset of SCC patients as the tumor
  progresses from primary to metastatic stage. The observed frequency and pattern
  of loss indicate that INPP5A, a negative regulator of inositol signaling, may play
  a role in development and progression of cutaneous SCC tumors.
