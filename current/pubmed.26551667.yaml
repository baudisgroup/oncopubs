abstract: SÃ©zary syndrome is a leukemic and aggressive form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma
  (CTCL) resulting from the malignant transformation of skin-homing central memory
  CD4(+) T cells. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor-normal sample
  pairs from 25 patients with SÃ©zary syndrome and 17 patients with other CTCLs. These
  analyses identified a distinctive pattern of somatic copy number alterations in
  SÃ©zary syndrome, including highly prevalent chromosomal deletions involving the
  TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A and CDKN1B tumor suppressors. Mutation analysis identified
  a broad spectrum of somatic mutations in key genes involved in epigenetic regulation
  (TET2, CREBBP, KMT2D (MLL2), KMT2C (MLL3), BRD9, SMARCA4 and CHD3) and signaling,
  including MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11 and PRKG1 mutations driving increased MAPK, NF-ÎºB
  and NFAT activity upon T cell receptor stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide
  new insights into the genetics of SÃ©zary syndrome and CTCL and support the development
  of personalized therapies targeting key oncogenically activated signaling pathways
  for the treatment of these diseases.
