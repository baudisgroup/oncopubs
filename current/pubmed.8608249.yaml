abstract: Primary mediastinal thymic B-cell lymphoma is a high-grade non-Hodgkins
  lymphoma with unique features. By using comparative genomic hybridization and interphase
  cytogenetics, 26 tumors were analyzed to identify genomic imbalances. Gains of chromosomal
  material were much more frequent than losses 110 v 10 and involved chromosomes 9p,
  12q, and Xq 31 to 50 . Interestingly, gain of Xq coincided with gain of 9p. Distinct
  high-level amplifications were found in four subregions. In 2 cases, amplifications
  of proto-oncogene REL were shown by filter hybridization, indicating a possible
  pathogenic role of this gene. The characteristic pattern of chromosomal imbalances
  distinct from other B-cell lymphomas suggests a specific pathway of genetic changes
  associated with this lymphoma.
