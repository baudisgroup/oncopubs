abstract: 'No data on the chromosomal constitution of spermatocytic seminomas are
  available thus far because of their rarity. Ploidy analysis performed on paraffin-embedded
  cases showed varying results from near- diploid to aneuploid. We applied comparative
  genomic hybridization on four snap-frozen primary spermatocytic seminomas of three
  different patients. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was successful in one, and
  amp quot interphase cytogenetics amp quot with centromeric region-specific probes
  was applied to another. The results from comparative genomic hybridization showed
  almost exclusively numerical chromosomal aberrations, in agreement with the data
  from karyotyping. Despite the limited number of cases studied, a nonrandom pattern
  of chromosome imbalances was detected: chromosome 9 was gained in all spermatocytic
  seminomas. This suggests that that this aberration plays a role in the development
  of this cancer. Interphase cytogenetics shows that the copy number of most chromosomes
  ranges from two to four, with an average of near trisomic. This constitutes the
  first report on the chromosomal constitution of spermatocytic seminomas.'
