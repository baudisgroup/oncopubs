abstract: In contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, adult cases are
  associated with a very poor prognosis. In order to ascertain whether the frequencies
  and patterns of submicroscopic changes, identifiable with single nucleotide polymorphism
  array analysis, differ between childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
  we performed single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of 126 adult cases, the
  largest series to date, including 18 paired diagnostic and relapse samples. Apart
  from identifying characteristic microdeletions of the CDKN2A, EBF1, ETV6, IKZF1,
  PAX5 and RB1 genes, the present study uncovered novel, focal deletions of the BCAT1,
  BTLA, NR3C1, PIK3AP1 and SERP2 genes in 2-6 of the adult cases. IKZF1 deletions
  were associated with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia P 0.036 , BCR-ABL1-positive
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia P 0.001 , and higher white blood cell counts P 0.005
  . In addition, recurrent deletions of RASSF3 and TOX were seen in relapse samples.
  Comparing paired diagnostic relapse samples revealed identical changes at diagnosis
  and relapse in 27 , clonal evolution in 22 , and relapses evolving from ancestral
  clones in 50 , akin to what has previously been reported in pediatric acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia and indicating that the mechanisms of relapse may be similar in adult and
  childhood cases. These findings provide novel insights into the leukemogenesis of
  adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, showing similarities to childhood disease in
  the pattern of deletions and the clonal relationship between diagnostic and relapse
  samples, but with the adult cases harboring additional aberrations that have not
  been described in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
