abstract: Gender-related differences in colorectal cancer CRC are not fully understood.
  Recent studies have shown that CRC arising in females are significantly associated
  with CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP-high . Using array comparative genomic
  hybridization, we analyzed a cohort of 116 CRCs 57 males, 59 females for chromosomal
  copy number aberrations CNA and found that CRC in females had significantly higher
  numbers of gains involving chromosome arms 1q21.2-q21.3, 4q13.2, 6p21.1 and 16p11.2
  and copy number losses of chromosome arm 11q25 compared to males. Interestingly,
  a subset of male CRCs 46 exhibited a feminization phenomenon in the form of gains
  of X chromosomes or an arm of X and or losses of the Y chromosome. Feminization
  of cancer cells was significantly associated with microsatellite-stable CRCs p-value
  0.003 and wild-type BRAF gene status p-value 0.009 . No significant association
  with other clinicopathological parameters was identified including disease-free
  survival. In summary, our data show that some CNAs in CRC may be gender specific
  and that male cancers characterized by feminization may constitute a specific subset
  of CRCs that warrants further investigation.
