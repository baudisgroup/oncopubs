abstract: 'This 32-year-old woman, 27 weeks pregnant, harbored a cystic mass with
  a solid component in the left frontal lobe. Histologically, the lesion was hypercellular
  and contained a diffuse sheet of eosinophilic cells of various sizes. The cells
  were almost round and had a few prominent, eccentrically placed, hyperchromatic
  nuclei of various sizes. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was reactive for vimentin,
  epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin AE1 AE3, smooth muscle actin, and BAF47
  INI-1, and negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament protein,
  S100 protein, CK7, CK20, HMB-45, MIC2, and Bcl-2. The Ki 67 labeling index was 4.2
  . Comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed aberrations of the chromosomal
  copy number of 7 and -10. This tumor could not be categorized according to the present
  World Health Organization classification. Results of staining with glial fibrillary
  acidic protein were not consistent with a glioma, and staining with INI-1 was inconsistent
  with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. The tumor was therefore designated as a amp
  quot cerebral tumor with extensive rhabdoid features. amp quot '
