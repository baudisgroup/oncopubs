abstract: Pituitary adenomas are the second most common primary brain tumor, yet their
  genetic profiles are incompletely understood.We performed whole-exome sequencing
  of 42 pituitary macroadenomas and matched normal DNA. These adenomas included hormonally
  active and inactive tumors, ones with typical or atypical histology, and ones that
  were primary or recurrent.We identified mutations, insertions/deletions, and copy
  number alterations. Nearly one-third of samples (29%) had chromosome arm-level copy-number
  alterations across large fractions of the genome. Despite such widespread genomic
  disruption, these tumors had few focal events, which is unusual among highly disrupted
  cancers. The other 71% of tumors formed a distinct molecular class, with somatic
  copy-number alterations involving less than 6% of the genome. Among the highly disrupted
  group, 75% were functional adenomas or atypical null-cell adenomas, whereas 87%
  of the less-disrupted group were nonfunctional adenomas. We confirmed this association
  between functional subtype and disruption in a validation dataset of 87 pituitary
  adenomas. Analysis of previously published expression data from an additional 50
  adenomas showed that arm-level alterations significantly impacted transcript levels,
  and that the disrupted samples were characterized by expression changes associated
  with poor outcome in other cancers. Arm-level losses of chromosomes 1, 2, 11, and
  18 were significantly recurrent. No significantly recurrent mutations were identified,
  suggesting no genes are altered by exonic mutations across large fractions of pituitary
  macroadenomas.These data indicate that sporadic pituitary adenomas have distinct
  copy number profiles that associate with hormonal and histologic subtypes and influence
  gene expression.
