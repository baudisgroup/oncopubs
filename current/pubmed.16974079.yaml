abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate chromosomal alterations
  in a large set of homogeneous tumors, 98 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. We also wanted
  to evaluate differences in chromosomal alterations in the different groups of tumors
  in relation to stage, survival and invasive or metastatic properties of the tumors.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect chromosomal alterations
  in tissue samples from 98 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. All chromosomes were involved
  in DNA copy number variations at least once in the tumor material, but certain changes
  were recurrent and rather specific. Among the specific changes, it was possible
  to identify 39 chromosomal regions displaying frequent DNA copy number alterations.
  The most frequent alteration was detected at 1q25-- amp gt q42, in which gains were
  found in 30 cases 30 . Gains at 19pter-- amp gt p13.1 were detected in 26 tumors
  26 and at 19q13.1-- amp gt q13.3 in 19 tumors 19 . Increased copy numbers were also
  detected at 8q 8q21-- amp gt q22 and 8q22-- amp gt qter , at a relatively high rate,
  in 17 cases 17 . Furthermore, gains at 10q21-- amp gt q23 and 10p were found in
  14 14 and 13 cases 13 , respectively. The most common losses were found in the three
  regions 4q22-- amp gt qter, 16q21-- amp gt qter and 18q21-- amp gt qter, all of
  which were detected in eight of the 98 tumors 8 . We also detected differences between
  the tumors from deceased patients and from survivors. Gain at 1q25-- amp gt q42
  was more commonly detected in the tumors from patients who died of cancer. We noted
  that the regions most affected differed in the different surgical stages I-IV .
  The results of the CGH analysis identify specific chromosomal regions affected by
  copy number changes, appropriate objects for further genetic studies.
