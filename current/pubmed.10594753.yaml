abstract: Spitz nevus is a benign neoplasm of melanocytes that can be difficult or
  impossible to distinguish from melanoma by clinical and histopathologic examination.
  We studied genomic DNA from 17 Spitz nevi by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . Thirteen lesions showed no chromosomal aberrations, three cases had a gain involving
  the entire p-arm of chromosome 11, and one case showed a gain of chromosome 7q21-qter.
  Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH on lesional tissue with a probe for the
  p-arm of chromosome 11 showed 6-10 p-arm signals per nucleus in those cases with
  a CGH-detected gain of chromosome 11p. One case with a normal CGH profile also showed
  increased copy number of 11p by FISH. Thus, the majority of Spitz nevi have a normal
  chromosomal complement at the level of CGH resolution however some may contain gains,
  with 11p apparently being the most frequently involved location. These findings
  differ significantly from the previously reported changes in primary cutaneous melanoma,
  which show frequent deletions of chromosomes 9p 82 , 10q 63 , 6q 28 , and 8p 22
  , as well as gains of chromosomes 7 50 , 8 34 , 6p 28 , 1q 25 by CGH analysis. These
  clear differences in the location and frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in
  Spitz nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas could represent a basis for developing
  adjunctive techniques for refining accuracy in the difficult differential diagnosis
  of spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms.
