abstract: Over-representation of sequences on chromosome 7 and 8 have been reported
  to be associated with aggressive behavior of prostate cancer. In this study we have
  performed a molecular cytogenetic survey by comparative genomic hybridization of
  a cohort of 40 prostate cancer patients, consisting of 20 progressors and 20 nonprogressors,
  after radical surgery for localized adenocarcinoma. Progression was defined as a
  biochemical relapse, ie, an elevation in prostate-specific antigen level in the
  serum. The mean follow-up after prostatectomy for the progressor group was 10.6
  years, for the nonprogressor group, 9.1 years. Using comparative genomic hybridization,
  we found that progressors harbored on average more aberrations than nonprogressors.
  Gains were especially more prominent among progressors p amp lt 0.05 , whereas a
  statistical trend was detected for losses p 0.10 . As a consequence we examined
  all chromosome arms separately. The frequencies of loss for areas known to be frequently
  deleted in prostate cancer, such as 6q, 8p, or 13q, were not different between the
  two groups. A tendency was observed for more frequent gain on 3q in the progressor
  group p 0.09 . However, gain of 8q minimal overlapping region at 8q24-qter was significantly
  more frequent in the progressor group p 0.04 . This biomarker retained its significance
  when adjusted for the factors age, tumor grade, tumor stage, resection margin status,
  and preoperative prostate-specific antigen level. In conclusion we have created
  a map of genetic changes in progressive and nonprogressive prostatic carcinomas.
  Importantly, the presence of gain of distal 8q markedly reduced the progression-free
  survival, suggesting a clinical role for 8q gain in assessing the malignant potential
  of localized prostatic adenocarcinoma.
