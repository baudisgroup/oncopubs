abstract: Pituitary adenomas are benign monoclonal tumors that are either hormonally
  functional or nonfunctional. Although their histologic and immunocytologic characteristics
  have been studied extensively, cytogenetic studies are scarce. We have investigated
  the cytogenetic alterations and DNA ploidy patterns of 12 sporadic pituitary adenomas,
  including 2 growth-hormone-secreting tumors, 1 prolactinoma, and 9 nonfunctional
  adenomas, by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and laser scanning cytometry
  LSC . CGH revealed that the mean number of sites of copy gain was significantly
  higher in functioning adenomas than in nonfunctioning tumors P amp lt 0.01 . The
  most frequent change detected was loss of 13q 5 cases , with a minimal common overlapping
  region at 13q14. These findings suggest that a putative tumor suppressor gene on
  13q14 may play an important role in the development of pituitary adenomas. DNA aneuploidy
  was detected by LSC in 3 of the 12 cases. The DNA aneuploid adenomas showed cytogenetic
  changes more frequently than did the DNA diploid tumors P amp lt 0.02 .
