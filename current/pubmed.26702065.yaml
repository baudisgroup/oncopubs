abstract: Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) and primary testicular
  lymphomas (PTLs) are extranodal large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) with inferior responses
  to current empiric treatment regimens. To identify targetable genetic features of
  PCNSL and PTL, we characterized their recurrent somatic mutations, chromosomal rearrangements,
  copy number alterations (CNAs), and associated driver genes, and compared these
  comprehensive genetic signatures to those of diffuse LBCL and primary mediastinal
  large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). These studies identify unique combinations of genetic
  alterations in discrete LBCL subtypes and subtype-selective bases for targeted therapy.
  PCNSLs and PTLs frequently exhibit genomic instability, and near-uniform, often
  biallelic, CDKN2A loss with rare TP53 mutations. PCNSLs and PTLs also use multiple
  genetic mechanisms to target key genes and pathways and exhibit near-uniform oncogenic
  Toll-like receptor signaling as a result of MYD88 mutation and/or NFKBIZ amplification,
  frequent concurrent B-cell receptor pathway activation, and deregulation of BCL6.
  Of great interest, PCNSLs and PTLs also have frequent 9p24.1/PD-L1/PD-L2 CNAs and
  additional translocations of these loci, structural bases of immune evasion that
  are shared with PMBL.
