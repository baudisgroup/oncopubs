abstract: To characterize genetic alterations in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise
  specified PTCL NOS , and anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma ALCL , 42 PTCL NOS and
  37 ALCL 17 anaplastic large cell kinase ALK -negative ALCL, 9 ALK-positive ALCL,
  11 cutaneous ALCL were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. Among 36 de
  novo PTCL NOS, recurrent chromosomal losses were found on chromosomes 13q minimally
  overlapping region 13q21, 36 of cases , 6q and 9p 6q21 and 9p21-pter, in 31 of cases
  each , 10q and 12q 10q23-24 and 12q21-q22, in 28 of cases each , and 5q 5q21, 25
  of cases . Recurrent gains were found on chromosome 7q22-qter 31 of cases . In 11
  PTCL NOS, high-level amplifications were observed, among them 3 cases with amplification
  of 12p13 that was restricted to cytotoxic PTCL NOS. Whereas cutaneous ALCL and ALK-positive
  ALCL showed few recurrent chromosomal imbalances, ALK-negative ALCL displayed recurrent
  chromosomal gains of 1q 1q41-qter, 46 , and losses of 6q 6q21, 31 and 13q 13q21-q22,
  23 . Losses of chromosomes 5q, 10q, and 12q characterized a group of noncytotoxic
  nodal CD5 peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The genetics of PTCL NOS and ALK-negative
  ALCL differ from other T-NHLs characterized genetically so far, among them enteropathy-type
  T-cell lymphoma, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and adult T-cell lymphoma leukemia.
