abstract: Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma MIFS is a low-grade malignant neoplasm
  for which limited genetic information, including a t 1 10 p22 q24 and amplification
  of chromosome 3 material, is available. To further characterize these aberrations,
  we have investigated eight soft tissue sarcomas diagnosed as MIFS, haemosiderotic
  fibrolipomatous tumour HFT , myxoid spindle cell pleomorphic sarcoma with MIFS features,
  and inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
  with prominent inflammation IMFH harbouring a t 1 10 or variants thereof and or
  ring chromosomes with possible involvement of chromosome 3. Using chromosome banding,
  fluorescence in situ hybridization, array-based comparative genomic hybridization,
  global gene expression, and real-time quantitative PCR analyses, we identified the
  breakpoint regions on chromosomes 1 and 10, demonstrated and delineated the commonly
  amplified region on chromosome 3, and assessed the consequences of these alterations
  for gene expression. The breakpoints in the t 1 10 mapped to TGFBR3 in 1p22 and
  in or near MGEA5 in 10q24, resulting in transcriptional up-regulation of NPM3 and
  particularly FGF8, two consecutive genes located close to MGEA5. The ring chromosomes
  contained a commonly amplified 1.44 Mb region in 3p11-12, which was associated with
  increased expression of VGLL3 and CHMP2B. The identified genetic aberrations were
  not confined to MIFS an identical t 1 10 was also found in a case of HFT and the
  amplicon in 3p was seen in an IMFH.
