abstract: Adrenocortical carcinoma ACC is a rare endocrine malignancy accounting for
  between 0.02 and 0.2 of all cancer deaths. Surgical removal offers the only current
  potential for cure. Unfortunately, ACC has undergone metastatic spread in 40 to
  70 of patients at the time of diagnosis. Standard chemotherapy with mitotane is
  often ineffective with intolerable side effects. The modern molecular technology
  of comparative genomic hybridization allows the examination of DNA for chromosomal
  alterations, which can lend biological insight into cancer processes. Genomes of
  25 ACC clinical samples were queried on the Agilent 44K Human Genome comparative
  genomic hybridization array detecting regions of chromosomal gain and loss within
  the tumor population. Commonly shared amplifications appearing in amp gt or 50 of
  tumors at P amp lt or 10 -4 include regions within chromosomes 5, 7, 12, 16q, and
  20. Deleted genomic regions within ACC include portions of chromosomes 1, 3p, 10q,
  11, 14q, 15q, 17, and 22q. Genomic aberrations in regions associated with differential
  survival P amp lt or 0.05 and presence in amp gt or 20 of tumors include amplifications
  of 6q, 7q, 12q, and 19p. Deletions within stratified survival groups include localized
  regions within 3, 8, 10p, 16q, 17q, and 19q. Statistical analysis of this genetic
  landscape reveals a set of chromosomal aberrations strongly associated with survival
  in an accumulation-dependent fashion. These regions may hold prognostic indicators
  and offer therapeutic targets that can be used to develop novel treatments for aggressive
  tumors.
