abstract: To identify chromosome alterations in Chinese bladder cancer, forty-six
  transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder were analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization. Frequent gains of DNA copy number were observed on 1p 13 46 , 1q
  13 46 , 5p 8 46 , 6p 9 46 , 7p 7 46 , 8q 12 46 , 11q 8 46 , 17q 11 46 , 19q 7 46
  , 20q 8 46 and Yq 8 46 , with minimal overlapping regions at 1p32-pter 10 46 , 1q21-q24
  12 46 , 5p 8 46 , 6p22-p23 7 46 , 7p11.2-p14 7 46 , 8q22-q24 12 46 , 11q13-q14 8
  46 , 17q22-qter 11 46 , 19q11-13.2 7 46 , 20q11-q13.2 8 46 and Yq11 8 46 . Losses
  were predominantly found on 2q 16 46 , 5q 8 46 , 8p 7 46 , 9p 8 46 , 9q 13 46 ,
  11p 7 46 , 13q 7 46 , 17p 12 46 , 18q 7 46 , Xp 18 46 and Xq 19 46 , with smallest
  overlapping regions at 2q32-qter 16 46 , 5q12-q31 8 46 , 8p12-pter 7 46 , 9p21-pter
  10 46 , 9q 13 46 , 11p 7 46 , 13q13-q22 7 46 , 17p 12 46 , 18q21-qter 7 46 , Xp
  18 46 and Xq 19 46 . There were significantly higher frequencies of gains of 1q21-q24
  and 17q22-qter in moderately differentiated tumors as compared with those in well-differentiated
  tumors, indicating a possible association of these two abnormalities with the dedifferentiation
  of tumor cells. Gains of 1p32-pter, 5p, 6p22-p23, 11q13-q14, 17q22-qter and losses
  of 2q32-qter, 9q, 17p were more frequent in pT1 as compared with those in pTa carcinomas.
  Gains at 1q21-q24, 7p11.2-p14, 8q22-q24, 19q, 20q11-q13.2 and losses at 5q12-q31,
  8p12-pter, 9p21-pter, 11p, 13q13-q22 and 18q21-qter were unique to pT1 and higher
  stage tumors, suggesting that genes responsible for the invasion and progression
  of bladder cancer might be located at these chromosomal regions. In multiple tumors
  from the same patients, consistent alterations such as gains of 8q, 11q13-q14, 12q13-q15,
  13q12, 20q and losses of 2q32-qter, 8p, 9, 11p, 11q21-qter, 13q13-qter, X were detected.
  These abnormalities were possibly earlier events, which might play a critical role
  during the genesis of the tumors. Further detailed studies to the recurrent aberration
  regions may lead to the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved
  in the development and progression of Chinese bladder cancer.
