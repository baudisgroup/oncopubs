abstract: Malignant mesothelioma MM is an asbestos-induced tumor that acquires aneuploid
  DNA content during the tumorigenic process. We used instable MM cell lines as an
  in vitro model to study the impact of DNA copy-number changes on gene expression
  profiling, in the course of their chromosomal redistribution process. Two MM cell
  lines, PMR-MM2 early passages of in vitro culture and PMR-MM7 both early and late
  passages of in vitro culture , were cytogenetically characterized. Genomic gains
  and losses were precisely defined using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array-CGH , and minimal overlapping analysis led to the identification of the common
  unbalanced genomic regions. Using the U133Plus 2.0 Affymetrix gene chip array, we
  analyzed PMR-MM7 early and late passages for genome-wide gene expression, and correlated
  the differentially expressed genes with copy-number changes. The presence of a high
  number of genetic imbalances occurring from early to late culture steps reflected
  the tendency of MM cells toward genomic instability. The selection of specific chromosomal
  abnormalities observed during subsequent cultures demonstrated the spontaneous evolution
  of the cancer cells in an in vitro environment. MM cell lines were characterized
  by copy-number changes associated with the TP53 apoptotic pathway already present
  at the first steps of in vitro culture. Prolonged culture led to acquisition of
  additional chromosomal copy-number changes associated with dysregulation of genes
  involved in cell adhesion, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, signal transduction,
  carbohydrate metabolism, motor activity, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, protein
  binding activity, lipid transport, ATP synthesis, and methyltransferase activity.
