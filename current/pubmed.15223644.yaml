abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was carried out in 30 mantle cell
  lymphoma MCL patients at the time of diagnosis. CGH results were supported by conventional
  cytogenetics CC , FISH, molecular genetic PCR methods and 2 patients were examined
  by array CGH. Using all cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic and PCR methods, chromosomal
  changes were detected in 28 93 patients. Using CGH, unbalanced chromosomal changes
  were detected in 24 80 cases. The most frequent aberrations were losses of 1p 8
  cases , 8p 10 cases , 9q 6 cases , 11q 11 cases , 13q 10 cases and 17p 9 cases ,
  and gains of chromosome 3 and 3q 12 cases and 8q 7 cases . Total number of 60 gains
  and 116 losses were detected. The primary chromosomal change t 11 14 was detected
  using FISH and or PCR in 20 66.6 patients, and in 9 of them, the breakpoint was
  determined using PCR in the major translocation cluster MTC . The evaluation of
  the frequencies of CGH changes in groups of patients with and without t 11 14 revealed
  the differences only in losses 6q and 9q, which were only found in patient with
  t 11 14 . An important result was obtained using array CGH method. In a patient
  without the primary t 11 14 , the gain of CCND1 gene was found. Our results show
  high heterogeneity of the additional chromosomal changes in MCL cases, which involved
  specific chromosomal subregions. We did not confirm the importance of subdividing
  of MCL cases with and without t 11 14 . Also, statistical significance in survival
  rates between both subgroups was not confirmed.
