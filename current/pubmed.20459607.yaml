abstract: HER2 gene amplification and protein overexpression HER2 define a clinically
  challenging subgroup of breast cancer with variable prognosis and response to therapy.
  Although gene expression profiling has identified an ERBB2 molecular subtype of
  breast cancer, it is clear that HER2 tumors reside in all molecular subtypes and
  represent a genomically and biologically heterogeneous group, needed to be further
  characterized in large sample sets.
