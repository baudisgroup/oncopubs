abstract: Fifteen cases of high grade primary gastric non-Hodgkins lymphomas were
  studied using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and or fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH techniques. A total of 10 cases of diffuse large cell lymphoma
  DLCL with no histologically identifiable or previous history of low grade mucosa-associated
  lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma components were examined, four by CGH and validated
  by FISH, and the remaining six by FISH alone. All 10 tumors showed gains in chromosome
  12. Other recurring CGH findings in DLCL included copy number gains of 1q and deletions
  of 6q. Five cases of high grade tumors with low grade MALT components HGM were also
  examined, three by CGH and validated by FISH and two by FISH only. Only one in five
  HGM showed gains of chromosome 12. Other recurring CGH findings in HGM included
  7q and 11q. We conclude that high grade gastric lymphomas of DLCL type were associated
  with gains in chromosome 12. The change was much less frequent P amp lt 0.01 in
  the HGM type, which had a percentage similar to that observed in previously reported
  cytogenetics FISH studies on low grade MALT lymphomas. Our findings suggested that
  many DLCL were not derived from transformation of low grade MALT lymphomas.
