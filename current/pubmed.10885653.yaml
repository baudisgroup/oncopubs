abstract: Astroblastomas are uncommon brain tumors whose classification and histogenesis
  have been debated. Precise criteria for diagnosis have been described only recently,
  but have not found wide acceptance. We report the clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic
  features of 20 astroblastomas, and the chromosomal alterations in seven cases as
  detected by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The tumors occurred both in
  children and young adults average age, 14 years , most often as well circumscribed,
  peripheral, cerebral hemispheric masses. Radiographically, the lesions were contrast-enhancing
  and solid, often with a cystic component. All were characterized histologically
  by astroblastic pseudorosettes, and most displayed prominent perivascular hyalinization,
  regional hyaline changes, and pushing borders in regard to adjacent brain. Tumor
  cells were strongly immunoreactive for S-100 protein, GFAP, and vimentin. Staining
  for EMA was focal. Ten of 20 astroblastomas were classified as amp quot well differentiated
  amp quot and 10 were classified as amp quot malignant, amp quot largely on the basis
  of hypercellular zones with increased mitotic indices, vascular proliferation, and
  necrosis with pseudopalisading. All 10 well differentiated lesions and 8 of 10 malignant
  lesions were completely resected. None of the well differentiated astroblastomas
  recurred within the limited follow-up period. Three malignant astroblastomas recurred,
  including two incompletely resected tumors, and one that had been totally resected.
  One patient died of disease following recurrence. The most frequent chromosomal
  alterations detected by CGH were gains of chromosome arm 20q 4 7 tumors and chromosome
  19 3 7 . The combination of these gains occurred in three, including two well differentiated
  and one malignant astroblastoma. Other alterations noted in two tumors each were
  losses on 9q, 10, and X. These chromosomal alterations are not typical of ependymoma
  or infiltrating astrocytic neoplasms, and suggest that astroblastomas may have a
  characteristic cytogenetic profile in addition to their distinctive clinical, radiographic,
  and histopathologic features.
