abstract: Androgen deprivation therapy ADT and novel agents targeting the androgen
  synthesis axis e.g., abiraterone acetate are adjuvant therapies that are currently,
  or may in the future be, combined with radiotherapy to reduce the chance of disease
  relapse. Little is known about allelic loss or gain pertaining to genes associated
  with the androgen synthesis axis and whether this is prognostic in patients who
  receive localized radiotherapy. In this hypothesis generating study, we conducted
  an array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH analysis of 33 androgen synthesis
  genes to identify potential prognostic factors for radiotherapy outcome.
