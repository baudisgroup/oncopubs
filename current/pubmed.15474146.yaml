abstract: 'Many detailed genetic studies have been reported on prostate carcinogenesis.
  A major shortcoming of these studies, however, is the fact that most data have been
  gained from investigations that were performed at a single point of time during
  tumor development. Only little is known on the dynamic process of genetic changes
  during the course of the disease. We performed comparative genomic hybridization
  in two cases of prostate cancer brain metastases. Tissue samples from the primary
  tumors, the locally recurrent tumor in one case, and the brain metastases from both
  cases were available for analysis. The number of chromosome abnormalities was found
  to be increased in the metastases. This contrasts to a remarkably stable chromosome
  composition of the primary tumor over several years, even in an androgen-depleted
  environment. When focusing on these changes, which either emerged as new common
  aberrations in both brain metastases, or which were commonly present in the primary
  and metastatic tumors, we were able to delineate five chromosomal sites that are
  assumed to be related to prostate cancer metastasis: 8q21 approximately q22, 8q24,
  15q24 approximately q26, 20q12 approximately q13.1, and Xq12 approximately q21.
  These findings provide new evidence for a putative role of genes at 15q and 20q
  in the metastatic process of prostate cancer.'
