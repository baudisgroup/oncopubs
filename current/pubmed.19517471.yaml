abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas DLBCLs are the most common type of non-Hodgkin
  lymphomas. With chemotherapy and progenitor stem cell transplantation, about 60
  of patients with DLBCL are long-term survivors. The International Prognostic Index
  identifies patients with different outcomes. However, biologic characteristics also
  may help to discriminate different treatments groups.
