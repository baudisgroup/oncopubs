abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was applied for a comprehensive screening
  of frequently occurring net gains and losses of chromosomal subregions in small
  populations of CD30 Hodgkin cells and their morphological variants. In 12 Hodgkins
  lymphomas, recurrent gains were detected on chromosomal arms 2p, 9p, and 12q in
  six, four, and five tumors, respectively and distinct high-level amplifications
  were identified on chromosomal bands 4p16, 4q23-q24, and 9p23-p24. In Hodgkin cells
  with 9p23-p24 amplification, fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed an increased
  copy number of chromosomal sequences spanning the tyrosine kinase gene JAK2. Several
  of the imbalances described, in particular a gain in chromosomal arm 9p that includes
  JAK2 amplification, are similar to the genomic changes detected in primary mediastinal
  B-cell lymphoma.
