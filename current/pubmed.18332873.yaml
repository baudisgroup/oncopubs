abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC is a rare but distinctive tumor. Oligonucleotide
  array comparative genomic hybridization has been applied for cataloging genomic
  copy number alterations CNAs in 17 frozen salivary or bronchial tumors. Only four
  whole chromosome CNAs were found, and most cases had 2-4 segmental CNAs. No high
  level amplification was observed. There were recurrent gains at 7p15.2, 17q21-25,
  and 22q11-13, and recurrent losses at 1p35, 6q22-25, 8q12-13, 9p21, 12q12-13, and
  17p11-13. The minimal region of gain at 7p15.2 contained the HOXA cluster. The minimal
  common regions of deletions contained the CDKN2A CDKN2B, TP53, and LIMA1 tumor suppressor
  genes. The recurrent deletion at 8q12.3-13.1 contained no straightforward tumor
  suppressor gene, but the MIRN124A2 microRNA gene, whose product regulates MMP2 and
  CDK6. Among unique CNAs, gains harbored CCND1, KIT PDGFRA KDR, MDM2, and JAK2. The
  CNAs involving CCND1, MDM2, KIT, CDKN2A 2B, and TP53 were validated by FISH and
  or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Although most tumors overexpressed
  cyclin D1 compared with surrounding glands, the only case to overexpress MDM2 had
  the corresponding CNA. In conclusion, our report suggests that ACC is characterized
  by a relatively low level of structural complexity. Array CGH and immunohistochemical
  data implicate MDM2 as the oncogene targeted at 12q15. The gain at 4q12 warrants
  further exploration as it contains a cluster of receptor kinase genes KIT PDGFRA
  KDR , whose products can be responsive to specific therapies.
