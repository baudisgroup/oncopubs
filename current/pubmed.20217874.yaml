abstract: Although genomic copy number aberrations CNAs of gastric carcinoma at the
  advanced stage have already been extensively characterized by array comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH analysis, those of gastric carcinoma in situ CIS
  are still poorly understood. Furthermore, no reports have demonstrated correlations
  between CNAs and histopathological features of gastric adenoma. In this study, we
  investigated CNAs of 20 gastric CISs Vienna category 4.2 and 20 adenomas including
  seven low-grade adenomas LGA Vienna category 3 and 13 high-grade adenomas HGA Vienna
  category 4.1 , using oligonucleotide-based array CGH. The most frequent aberrations
  in CIS were gains at 8q 85 and 20q 50 , and losses at 5q 50 and 17p 50 , suggesting
  that these CNAs are involved in the development of CIS. We found that the pattern
  of CNAs in HGA was quite different from that in LGA. The most frequent CNAs in HGA
  were gains at 8q 62 and 7pq 54 , whereas those in LGA were gain at 7q21.3-q22.1
  57 and loss at 5q 43 . Interestingly, gains at 8q and 7pq, both of which occurred
  most frequently in HGA, were not detected in any cases of LGA. Of note, 8q gain
  was detected most frequently in both HGA and CIS but was undetected in LGA. Since
  HGA is believed to have a higher risk of progression to invasive carcinoma than
  LGA, these data suggest that 8q gain is important for the malignant transformation
  of gastric adenoma.
