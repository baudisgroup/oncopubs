abstract: The characterization of copy number alteration patterns in breast cancer
  requires high-resolution genome-wide profiling of a large panel of tumor specimens.
  To date, most genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization studies have used
  tumor panels of relatively large tumor size and high Nottingham Prognostic Index
  NPI that are not as representative of breast cancer demographics.
