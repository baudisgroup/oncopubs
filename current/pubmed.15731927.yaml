abstract: Merkel cell carcinoma was diagnosed in a 79-year-old Caucasian woman. The
  tumour was localised to the upper lip and was in stage T2. After successful cryosurgery
  and a 7-year tumour-free period, a new tumour developed in her palatine tonsil.
  Histologically and immunohistochemically, this resembled the tumour in the lip.
  The regional lymph nodes were devoid of metastasis. The paraffin-embedded material
  of the two tumours and the unaffected lymphatic tissue were analysed with DNA microarrays
  for comparative genomic hybridisation to assess the genetic relationship of the
  tumours. In both tumours, regions on 2p and 10p were commonly over-represented,
  while 41 regions on chromosomes 1-4, 6, 8-9, 11 and 14-22 were commonly under-represented.
  Chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 16-18 and X were most frequently involved in the DNA losses.
  In gene copy numbers in the two tumours, 31 chromosome locations were found to be
  differently affected. The partly similar and partly different molecular patterns
  indicated a genetic relationship between the tumours and excluded the possibility
  that the tonsillar tumour was a metastasis. The findings suggest that a genetically
  altered field was the reason for the development of the tonsillar cancer thus, it
  can be regarded pathogenetically as a second field tumour.
