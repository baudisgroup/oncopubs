abstract: Merkel cell carcinoma or small cell carcinoma of the skin is a rare skin
  cancer seen in increasing numbers in Queensland, Australia. In its clinical course
  and histopathology, it resembles small cell lung carcinoma SCLC . Little is known
  of the genetic basis of this disease except for a number of cytogenetic studies
  and three loss of heterozygosity studies. Therefore, comparative genomic hybridization
  was performed to determine the characteristic DNA gains and losses that occur in
  this tumor. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 34 specimens from 24 patients
  revealed a pattern of gains and losses that closely resembles that seen in SCLC.
  Overall frequent loss was seen for chromosomes 3p 46 , 5q 21 , 8p 21 , 10 33 , 11q
  17 , 13q 33 , and 17p 25 . Significant gains were seen for chromosomes 1 63 , 3q
  33 , 5p 38 , 8q 38 , 19 63 , and X 41 , with smaller numbers having gains for chromosomes
  6, 7, 20, and 21. In contrast to SCLC, amplification in Merkel cell carcinoma is
  a rare event.
