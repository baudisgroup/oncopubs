abstract: 'We studied 23 pediatric high-grade astrocytomas by comparative genomic
  hybridization. Chromosomal imbalances were found in 10 of 10 anaplastic astrocytomas
  and 11 of 13 glioblastomas and consisted of 1q 43 , 3q 26 , 1p, 2q, 5q 22 , -22q
  34 , -6q, -10q 30 , -9q, -11q, -13q, -16q, and -17p 22 . Anaplastic astrocytomas
  frequently showed 5q 40 , 1q 30 , -22q 50 , -6q, -9q 40 , and -12q 30 glioblastomas
  1q 54 , 3q 38 , 2q, 17q 23 , -6q, -8q, -10q, -13q, and -17p 31 . Minimal common
  regions mapped to 1q21-41, 3q27-qter, 2q31-32, 5q14-22, -22q12-qter, -10q23-25,
  -6q25-qter, -9q34.2, -11q14-22, -16q22-qter, and -17p. High-level gains were located
  on 1q 7 cases , 2q, 7q 4 cases , 3q 3 cases , 9, 17q 2 cases , 4q, 8q, 18, and 20q
  1 case . A significantly shorter survival was found for anaplastic astrocytomas
  showing 1q P: amp lt 0.05 , MIB-1 proliferation index amp gt 25 P: amp lt 0.001
  and glioblastomas P: amp lt 0.05 . Compared with adult cases, 1p, 2q, and 21q as
  well as -6q, -11q, and -16q were more frequent in pediatric malignant astrocytomas.
  Among the latter 5q, -6q, -9q, -12q, and -22q were characteristic for pediatric
  anaplastic astrocytomas and 1q, 3q, 16p, -8q, and -17p for pediatric glioblastomas.
  Our results show that chromosomal aberrations differ between pediatric anaplastic
  astrocytomas and glioblastomas as well as between pediatric and adult high-grade
  astrocytomas, supporting the notion of a different genetic pathway. Furthermore,
  gains of chromosomal material on 1q might be correlated with a worse prognosis in
  pediatric anaplastic astrocytomas.'
