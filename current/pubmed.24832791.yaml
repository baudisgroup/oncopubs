abstract: To outline further genetic mechanisms of transformation from follicular
  lymphoma FL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL , we have performed whole genome
  array-CGH in 81 tumors from 60 patients 29 de novo DLBCL dnDLBCL , 31 transformed
  DLBCL tDLBCL , and 21 antecedent FL . In 15 patients, paired tumor samples primary
  FL and a subsequent tDLBCL were available, among which three possessed more than
  two subsequent tumors, allowing us to follow specific genetic alterations acquired
  before, during, and after the transformation. Gain of 2p15-16.1 encompassing, among
  others, the REL, BCL11A, USP34, COMMD1, and OTX1 genes was found to be more common
  in the tDLBCL compared with dnDLBCL P lt 0.001 . Furthermore, a high-level amplification
  of 2p15-16.1 was also detected in the FL stage prior to transformation, indicating
  its importance during the transformation event. Quantitative real-time PCR showed
  a higher level of amplification of REL, USP34, and COMMD1 all involved in the NFkappaBeta-pathway
  compared with BCL11A, which indicates that the altered genes disrupting the NFkappaBeta
  pathway may be the driver genes of transformation rather than the previously suggested
  BCL11A. Moreover, a 17q21.33 amplification was exclusively found in tDLBCL, never
  in FL P lt 0.04 or dnDLBCL, indicating an upregulation of genes of importance during
  the later phase of transformation. Taken together, our study demonstrates potential
  genomic markers for disease progression to clinically more aggressive forms. We
  also confirm the importance of the TP53-, CDKN2A-, and NFkappaBeta-pathways for
  the transformation from FL to DLBCL.
