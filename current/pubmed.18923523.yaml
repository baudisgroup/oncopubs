abstract: Neuroblastoma, a tumour derived from the peripheral sympathetic nervous
  system, is one of the most frequent solid tumours in childhood. It usually occurs
  sporadically but familial cases are observed, with a subset of cases occurring in
  association with congenital malformations of the neural crest being linked to germline
  mutations of the PHOX2B gene. Here we conducted genome-wide comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis on a large series of neuroblastomas. Copy number increase
  at the locus encoding the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK tyrosine kinase receptor
  was observed recurrently. One particularly informative case presented a high-level
  gene amplification that was strictly limited to ALK, indicating that this gene may
  contribute on its own to neuroblastoma development. Through subsequent direct sequencing
  of cell lines and primary tumour DNAs we identified somatic mutations of the ALK
  kinase domain that mainly clustered in two hotspots. Germline mutations were observed
  in two neuroblastoma families, indicating that ALK is a neuroblastoma predisposition
  gene. Mutated ALK proteins were overexpressed, hyperphosphorylated and showed constitutive
  kinase activity. The knockdown of ALK expression in ALK-mutated cells, but also
  in cell lines overexpressing a wild-type ALK, led to a marked decrease of cell proliferation.
  Altogether, these data identify ALK as a critical player in neuroblastoma development
  that may hence represent a very attractive therapeutic target in this disease that
  is still frequently fatal with current treatments.
