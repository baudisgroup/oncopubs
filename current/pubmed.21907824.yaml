abstract: The diagnosis and classification of many cancers depends in part on the
  identification of large-scale genomic aberrations such as chromosomal deletions,
  duplications, and balanced translocations. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array CGH can detect chromosomal imbalances on a genome-wide scale but cannot reliably
  identify balanced chromosomal rearrangements. We describe a simple modification
  of array CGH that enables simultaneous identification of recurrent balanced rearrangements
  and genomic imbalances on the same microarray. Using custom tiling oligonucleotide
  arrays and gene-specific linear amplification primers, translocation CGH tCGH maps
  balanced rearrangements to 100-base resolution and facilitates the rapid cloning
  and sequencing of novel rearrangement breakpoints. As proof of principle, we used
  tCGH to characterize nine of the most common gene fusions in mature B-cell neoplasms
  and myeloid leukemias. Because tCGH can be performed in any CGH-capable laboratory
  and can screen for multiple recurrent translocations and genome-wide imbalances,
  it should be of broad utility in the diagnosis and classification of various types
  of lymphomas, leukemias, and solid tumors.
