abstract: Malignant mesotheliomas are tumors known for their extensive heterogeneity.
  Apart from the three classical patterns, predominantly epithelioid, sarcomatoid,
  and biphasic, some rare variants do exist. In some cases, one can find uncommon
  additional mesodermal tumor components. These tumors have previously been called
  amp quot mesodermomas amp quot and, like regular mesotheliomas, are usually associated
  with a previous asbestos exposure. We examined eight cases of mesodermomas by light
  microscopy, immunohistochemistry and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Besides
  biphasic and epithelioid areas, unusual epithelial, chondroid, osseous, or even
  angioblastic elements may be found to varying degrees. Immunohistochemical analysis
  shows similar staining results as with regular mesotheliomas. CGH reveals a high
  number of chromosomal imbalances 16.5 per case range, 11-27 . In 10 classical biphasic
  mesotheliomas that served as a control, defects of comparable number and severity
  could not be detected 8 per case range, 2-16 . The most frequent defects of mesodermomas
  losses on 1p, 4pq, 9p, 13q, 14q, and gains on 1q and 15q , however, could also be
  found in mesotheliomas of the classical type. Thus, our results support the classification
  of the so-called mesodermomas as a separate tumor subgroup while maintaining the
  relationship to the classical mesotheliomas. Therefore, we propose to use the term
  mesodermoma for this subgroup.
