abstract: The origin of carcinosarcomas of the ovary and uterus has long been discussed.
  In this study, we used a molecular-genetic approach to elucidate the tumorigenesis
  of carcinosarcomas of these organs correlating our findings with the specific biphasic
  pattern of these tumors. We analyzed a series of 30 paraffin-embedded carcinosarcomas
  of the ovary and the uterus using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence
  in-situ hybridization FISH . In general, gains 85 were observed more frequently,
  than losses 30 . Characteristic and frequent chromosomal amplification was observed
  on chromosome 8q and 20q 42 and 70 . FISH revealed c-myc 8q24.12 and ZNF217 20q13.2
  amplification in 78 and 87 . Amplification of ZNF217 was mostly seen in both tumor
  components, whereas amplification of c-myc was observed less often in the sarcomatous
  than in the carcinomatous tumor component. Analysis of the proliferation index using
  Ki67 immunohistochemistry revealed a strong or moderate expression in all cases,
  wherein the carcinomatous tumor component showed significantly a higher proliferation
  index compared to the sarcomatous tumor areas. Although our results are in agreement
  with a monoclonal origin of ovarian and uterine carcinosarcomas, the carcinomatous
  component seems to be the more aggressive part of the tumor. Furthermore, the observed
  patterns of genetic aberrations are highly similar to those of serous carcinomas.
  This is compatible with the current opinion that these neoplasms should be considered
  as metaplastic carcinomas.
