abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC is a tumour type that generally
  carries very complex chromosomal aberrations. An interesting feature is the elevated
  occurrence 58 of whole arm translocations and isochromosomes, resulting from breakage
  and illegitimate recombination in centromeric or pericentromeric regions. We hypothesized
  that alterations in DNA methylation may play a role in the breakage of centromeric
  repeat sequences in these tumours.
