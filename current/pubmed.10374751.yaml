abstract: In contrast to astrocytic tumors, approximately two thirds of anaplastic
  oligodendrogliomas are reported to be chemosensitive. Relatively little is known
  about the genetic aberrations in oligodendroglial tumors OTs . In order to elucidate
  oligodendroglial oncogenesis and to find specific genetic aberrations that may have
  prognostic and therapeutic implications, we performed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to detect chromosomal copy number changes in 17 low-grade OTs LG-OTs and 12
  high-grade OTs HG-OTs lacking a prominent astrocytic component. Loss of chromosome
  1p 79 and 19q 76 were most frequently detected by CGH, all LG-OTs and 50 of the
  HG-OTs contained -1p including 1p36-32 , -19q including 19q13.3 , or both, and the
  rest of the HG-OTs showed 7, -10, or both. Since losses of 1p36-32 and 19q13.3 were
  mutually exclusive with 7 or -10, the HG-OTs could be divided in -1p -19q and 7
  -10 tumors. While the -1p -19q tumors can be considered as pure anaplastic oligodendrogliomas,
  the 7 -10 tumors may rather be glioblastomas with prominent oligodendroglial differentiation.
  We conclude that CGH is a powerful tool to assist in the identification of 2 major
  subgroups of HG-OTs with prognostic and possibly therapeutic relevance.
