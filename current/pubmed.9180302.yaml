abstract: Marginal zone B cell lymphoma MZBCL represents a distinct subtype of B cell
  non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which has been recently recognized and defined as a disease
  entity. We investigated 25 cases 18 at primary diagnosis and seven during the course
  of disease of MZBCL by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and compared these
  results with cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , and Southern
  blot data. Twenty of the 25 cases 80 showed gains total 49 or losses total 15 of
  genetic material. In extranodal, nodal, and splenic MZBCL, material of chromosomes
  3 52 of cases , 18 32 , X 24 , and 1q 16 was most frequently gained, whereas losses
  predominantly involved chromosomes 17 16 and 9 12 . High-level amplifications involving
  the regions 18q21-23 and 18q21-22, respectively, were detected in two cases. Gains
  of chromosomes 1q and 8q and losses of chromosome 17 or 17p occurred more frequently
  in relapsed or progressive lymphomas. For all of the frequently affected chromosomes,
  CGH allowed narrowing of the relevant subregions including 3q21-23, 3q25-29 and
  18q21-23. By Southern blot analysis, the BCL2, BCL6, and CMYC proto-oncogenes were
  found to be a part of the over-represented regions in two cases, one case, and two
  cases, respectively, with gains involving 18q, 3q or 8q. In 13 cases, CGH revealed
  chromosomal imbalances which were not detected by cytogenetic analysis but could
  be confirmed by FISH or Southern blot analysis in all cases investigated. On the
  other hand, CGH failed to detect trisomy 3, trisomy 18, and deletion 7q in three
  cases with a low proportion of tumor cells bearing these abnormalities, as shown
  by interphase FISH. The characteristic pattern of chromosomal gains and losses detected
  in this study confirms the distinct nature of MZBCL and may point to chromosomal
  regions involved in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms.
