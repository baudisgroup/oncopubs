abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas arise almost exclusively in children,
  and despite advances in treatment, the majority of patients die within 2 years after
  initial diagnosis. Because of their infiltrative nature and anatomic location in
  an eloquent area of the brain, most pontine gliomas are treated without a surgical
  biopsy. The corresponding lack of tissue samples has resulted in a limited understanding
  of the underlying genetic and molecular biologic abnormalities associated with pontine
  gliomas, and is a substantial obstacle for the preclinical testing of targeted therapeutic
  agents for these tumors. We have established a human glioma cell line that originated
  from surgical biopsy performed on a patient with a pontine glioma. To insure sustainable
  in vitro propagation, tumor cells were modified with hTERT human telomerase ribonucleoprotein
  reverse transcriptase , and with a luciferase reporter to enable non-invasive bioluminescence
  imaging. The hTERT modified cells are tumorigenic in athymic rodents, and produce
  brainstem tumors that recapitulate the infiltrative growth of brainstem gliomas
  in patients.
