abstract: Approximately 25,000 ovarian cancers are diagnosed in the United States
  annually, and 75 of cases are in the advanced stage when they are largely incurable.
  There is a critical need for improved early detection tools and development of novel
  treatments. Recently, we showed that among 20q13-amplified genes in ovarian cancer,
  ADRM1 overexpression was the most highly correlated with amplification and was significantly
  upregulated with respect to stage, recurrence, and metastasis. In addition, overexpression
  of ADRM1 correlated significantly with shorter time to recurrence and overall survival.
  Herein, array-CGH and microarray expression of ovarian cancer cell lines provides
  evidence consistent with the primary tumor data that ADRM1 is a 20q13 amplification
  target. Knockdown of ADRM1 in amplified ovarian cell-line OAW42 results in downregulation
  of growth factor GIPC1 and upregulation of tumor-suppressor RECK RNA and protein.
  In our dataset of 141 ovarian primary tumors, ADRM1 overexpression significantly
  correlates with GIPC1 overexpression. In addition, there is a significant anticorrelation
  between ADRM1 overexpression and RECK expression. Further research is necessary
  to determine whether targeting knockdown of ADRM1 in 20q13-amplified ovarian cancers
  results in growth inhibition and tumor suppression via downstream targets GIPC1
  and RECK.
