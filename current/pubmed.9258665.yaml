abstract: The genetic basis and molecular pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
  CLL and the molecular mechanisms responsible for its progression remain poorly understood.
  Here, karyotyping techniques specifically optimized for CLL, comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH , and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to search for
  CLL-specific genetic aberrations. CGH and karyotyping both revealed copy number
  changes in 12 of the 25 CLL cases 48 analyzed. Loss at 11q emerged as the most common
  aberration 6 cases , followed by a gain of chromosome 12 4 and loss at 13q 3 . Concordance
  between CGH and G-banding was found in 23 of the 25 cases 92 , which is more than
  reported in a recent similar CGH study of CLL. Owing to the basic differences in
  G-banding and CGH, however, their simultaneous clinical application is recommended.
  The frequent loss of 11q14-24 suggests that this chromosomal region deserves further
  attention as a candidate locus involved in the pathogenesis of CLL.
