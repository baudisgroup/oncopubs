abstract: Extensive expression profiling studies have shown that sporadic breast cancer
  is composed of five clinically relevant molecular subtypes. However, although BRCA1-related
  tumours are known to be predominantly basal-like, there are few published data on
  other classes of familial breast tumours. We analysed a cohort of 75 BRCA1, BRCA2
  and non-BRCA1 2 breast tumours by gene expression profiling and found that 74 BRCA1
  tumours were basal-like, 73 of BRCA2 tumours were luminal A or B, and 52 non-BRCA1
  2 tumours were luminal A. Thirty-four tumours were also analysed by single nucleotide
  polymorphism-comparative genomic hybridization SNP-CGH arrays. Copy number data
  could predict whether a tumour was basal-like or luminal with high accuracy, but
  could not predict its mutation class. Basal-like BRCA1 and basal-like non-BRCA1
  tumours were very similar, and contained the highest number of chromosome aberrations.
  We identified regions of frequent gain containing potential driver genes in the
  basal 8q and 12p and luminal A tumours 1q and 17q . Regions of homozygous loss associated
  with decreased expression of potential tumour suppressor genes were also detected,
  including in basal tumours 5q and 9p , and basal and luminal tumours 10q . This
  study highlights the heterogeneity of familial tumours and the clinical consequences
  for treatment and prognosis.
