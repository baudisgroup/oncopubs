abstract: Cancer is a disease of genome instability and genomic alterations; now,
  genomic heterogeneity is rapidly emerging as a defining feature of cancer, both
  within and between tumors. Motivation for our pilot study of tumor heterogeneity
  in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is that it is not well studied, but
  the highest incidences of esophageal cancers are found in China and ESCC is the
  most common type. We profiled the mutations and changes in copy number that were
  identified by whole-exome sequencing and array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  in multiple regions within an ESCC from two patients. The average mutational heterogeneity
  rate was 90% in all regions of the individual tumors in each patient; most somatic
  point mutations were nonsynonymous substitutions, small Indels occurred in untranslated
  regions of genes, and copy number alterations varied among multiple regions of a
  tumor. Independent Sanger sequencing technology confirmed selected gene mutations
  with more than 88% concordance. Phylogenetic analysis of the somatic mutation frequency
  demonstrated that multiple, genomically heterogeneous divergent clones evolve and
  co-exist within a primary ESCC and metastatic subclones result from the dispersal
  and adaptation of an initially non-metastatic parental clone. Therefore, a single-region
  sampling will not reflect the evolving architecture of a genomically heterogeneous
  landscape of mutations in ESCC tumors and the divergent complexity of this genomic
  heterogeneity among patients will complicate any promise of a simple genetic or
  epigenetic diagnostic signature in ESCC. We conclude that any potential for informative
  biomarker discovery in ESCC and targeted personalized therapies will require a deeper
  understanding of the functional biology of the ontogeny and phylogeny of the tumor
  heterogeneity.
