abstract: The relationship between DNA sequence copy number aberrations DSCNAs and
  DNA ploidy in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas HNSCCs is still controversial.
  Materials and Methods We analyzed DSCNAs by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  combined with microdissection and DNA ploidy by laser scanning cytometry LSC in
  18 surgically removed HNSCCs and compared the data.
