abstract: Immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin has changed the way lobular neoplasia
  is perceived. It has helped to classify difficult cases of carcinoma in situ with
  indeterminate features and led to the identification of new variants of lobular
  carcinoma. Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma PLC and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in
  situ PLCIS , recently described variants of invasive and in situ classic lobular
  carcinoma, are reported to be associated with more aggressive clinical behaviour.
  Although PLC PLCIS show morphological features of classic lobular neoplasia and
  lack E-cadherin expression, it is still unclear whether these lesions evolve through
  the same genetic pathway as lobular carcinomas or are high-grade ductal neoplasms
  that have lost E-cadherin. Here we have analysed a case of extensive PLCIS and invasive
  PLC associated with areas of E-cadherin-negative carcinoma in situ with indeterminate
  features, using immunohistochemistry, chromogenic in situ hybridization, high-resolution
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH and array-based CGH. We observed that all
  lesions lacked E-cadherin and beta-catenin and showed gain of 1q and loss of 16q,
  features that are typical of lobular carcinomas but are not seen in high-grade ductal
  lesions. In addition, amplifications of c-myc and HER2 were detected in the pleomorphic
  components, which may account for the high-grade features in this case and the reported
  aggressive clinical behaviour of these lesions. Taken together, these data suggest
  that at least some PLCs may evolve from the same precursor or through the same genetic
  pathway as classic lobular carcinomas.
