abstract: Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase DPD is the initial enzyme acting in the
  catabolism of the widely used antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil 5FU . DPD deficiency
  is known to cause a potentially lethal toxicity following administration of 5FU.
  Here, we report novel genetic mechanisms underlying DPD deficiency in patients presenting
  with grade III IV 5FU-associated toxicity. In one patient a genomic DPYD deletion
  of exons 21-23 was observed. In five patients a deep intronic mutation c.1129-5923C
  amp gt G was identified creating a cryptic splice donor site. As a consequence,
  a 44 bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides c.1129-5967 to c.1129-5924 of intron
  10 was inserted in the mature DPD mRNA. The deleterious c.1129-5923C amp gt G mutation
  proved to be in cis with three intronic polymorphisms c.483 18G amp gt A, c.959-51T
  amp gt G, c.680 139G amp gt A and the synonymous mutation c.1236G amp gt A of a
  previously identified haplotype. Retrospective analysis of 203 cancer patients showed
  that the c.1129-5923C amp gt G mutation was significantly enriched in patients with
  severe 5FU-associated toxicity 9.1 compared to patients without toxicity 2.2 . In
  addition, a high prevalence was observed for the c.1129-5923C amp gt G mutation
  in the normal Dutch 2.6 and German 3.3 population. Our study demonstrates that a
  genomic deletion affecting DPYD and a deep intronic mutation affecting pre-mRNA
  splicing can cause severe 5FU-associated toxicity. We conclude that screening for
  DPD deficiency should include a search for genomic rearrangements and aberrant splicing.
