abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to search for gains, high-level
  amplifications and losses of DNA sequences along all chromosome arms in 19 primary
  Merkel cell carcinomas MCC . Extensive genetic aberrations, with a mean value of
  5.5 -1.1 changes per tumor were detected in 13 out of the 19 samples analyzed. Our
  CGH results reveal several new and other previously known chromosomal regions that
  are involved in the pathogenesis of MCC. The majority of the alterations were gains
  of whole chromosomes or whole chromosome arms. Compared to losses, the frequency
  of DNA copy number gains was two-fold. DNA sequence copy number gains were most
  common in chromosomes 6 42 , 1 37 , and 5 32 . The most frequent minimal common
  regions of gains were 6pterqter 42 , 1q11q31 32 , and 5p 32 . No recurrent high-level
  amplifications were observed. High-level amplifications of small chromosomal regions
  were found in four samples out of the 19 tumors analyzed 21 . Amplifications affected
  1q22q24 5 , 4p 5 , and 5p 5 . Losses most frequently affected chromosomes 13 21
  and 4 16 . Minimal common regions with the most frequent losses were 13q13q31 21
  , 4q 16 , and 16q 11 . No significant statistical correlation between genomic aberrations
  and clinicopathological factors was revealed, despite the fact that there was an
  obvious tendency towards it. Primary MCC expressing DNA alterations were predominantly
  distinguished in large tumors, and risk of metastatic dissemination was three-fold
  compared to tumors with no DNA alterations.
