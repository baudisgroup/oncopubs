abstract: Wilms tumor (WT), the most common cancer of the kidney in infants and children,
  has a complex etiology that is still poorly understood. Identification of genomic
  copy number variants (CNV) in tumor genomes provides a better understanding of cancer
  development which may be useful for diagnosis and therapeutic targets. In paired
  blood and tumor DNA samples from 14 patients with sporadic WT, analyzed by aCGH,
  22% of chromosome abnormalities were novel. All constitutional alterations identified
  in blood were segmental (in 28.6% of patients) and were also present in the paired
  tumor samples. Two segmental gains (2p21 and 20q13.3) and one loss (19q13.31) present
  in blood had not been previously described in WT. We also describe, for the first
  time, a small, constitutive partial gain of 3p22.1 comprising 2 exons of CTNNB1,
  a gene associated to WT. Among somatic alterations, novel structural chromosomal
  abnormalities were found, like gain of 19p13.3 and 20p12.3, and losses of 2p16.1-p15,
  4q32.5-q35.1, 4q35.2-q28.1 and 19p13.3. Candidate genes included in these regions
  might be constitutively (SIX3, SALL4) or somatically (NEK1, PIAS4, BMP2) operational
  in the development and progression of WT. To our knowledge this is the first report
  of CNV in paired blood and tumor samples in sporadic WT.
