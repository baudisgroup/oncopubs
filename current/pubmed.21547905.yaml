abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is highly invasive and is associated with
  frequent tumour recurrences and lymph node metastases. Identification of genes involved
  in the aggressiveness of OSCC may provide new targets for clinical intervention.
  A genome-wide study based on the Sty1 250K SNP array indicated the involvement of
  the Talin-1 TLN1 gene in the 9p13.3 amplicon, which was further validated by dual
  colour fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . Comparative analyses revealed that
  TLN1 was the most highly expressed integrin-cytoskeleton cross-linker that can trigger
  integrin activation. IHC analyses and mouse study also revealed an association between
  TLN1 overexpression and advanced OSCC with invasion to adjacent tissues. Survival
  analyses indicated a significant association between TLN1 genetic gain overexpression
  and a reduced overall survival in patients. Functional knockdown by a dominant negative
  TLN1 fragment reduced cell growth and invasiveness in TLN1-overexpressing cells
  via inactivation of downstream oncogenic signalling. The present study suggests
  an important role for TLN1 in oral cancer development. TLN1 overexpression could
  serve as a diagnostic marker for aggressive phenotypes and a potential target for
  treating OSCC.
