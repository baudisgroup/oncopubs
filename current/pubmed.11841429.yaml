abstract: We have carried out comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis on archival
  biopsy material from a series of 30 UK mantle cell lymphomas. The most frequent
  aberrations were gains of 3q 21 cases , 6p 19 cases , 7q 8 cases , 12p 8 cases ,
  12q 9 cases and 17q11q21 8 cases , and losses of 1p13p32 10 cases , 5p13p15.3 9
  cases , 6q14q27 11 cases , 8p 7 cases , 11q13q23 8 cases and 13q 18 cases . Nineteen
  cases 63 had a common region of amplification at 3q28q29, which was highly amplified
  in three cases, suggesting the presence of a mantle cell lymphoma MCL -related oncogene
  in this region. There was a minimal common region of deletion at 6q25q26 in nine
  cases 30 . No MCL-specific locus has previously been identified on chromosome 6
  and this region may contain a tumour suppressor gene specifically implicated in
  the development of this subtype of lymphoma. An increased number of chromosome aberrations,
  gain of Xq and loss of 17p were all significantly associated with a worse prognosis.
  A greater understanding of the genetics of mantle cell lymphoma may allow the identification
  of prognostic factors which will aid the identification of appropriate treatment
  regimens.
