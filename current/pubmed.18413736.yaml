abstract: This study was designed to identify highly recurrent genetic alterations
  typical of S zary syndrome Sz , an aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma leukemia,
  possibly revealing pathogenetic mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. High-resolution
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization was done on malignant T cells from
  20 patients. Expression levels of selected biologically relevant genes residing
  within loci with frequent copy number alteration were measured using quantitative
  PCR. Combined binary ratio labeling-fluorescence in situ hybridization karyotyping
  was done on malignant cells from five patients. Minimal common regions with copy
  number alteration occurring in at least 35 of patients harbored 15 bona fide oncogenes
  and 3 tumor suppressor genes. Based on the function of the identified oncogenes
  and tumor suppressor genes, at least three molecular mechanisms are relevant in
  the pathogenesis of Sz. First, gain of cMYC and loss of cMYC antagonists MXI1 and
  MNT were observed in 75 and 40 to 55 of patients, respectively, which were frequently
  associated with deregulated gene expression. The presence of cMYC MAX protein heterodimers
  in S zary cells was confirmed using a proximity ligation assay. Second, a region
  containing TP53 and genome maintenance genes RPA1 HIC1 was lost in the majority
  of patients. Third, the interleukin 2 IL-2 pathway was affected by gain of STAT3
  STAT5 and IL-2 receptor genes in 75 and 30 , respectively, and loss of TCF8 and
  DUSP5 in at least 45 of patients. In sum, the Sz genome is characterized by gross
  chromosomal instability with highly recurrent gains and losses. Prominent among
  deregulated genes are those encoding cMYC, cMYC-regulating proteins, mediators of
  MYC-induced apoptosis, and IL-2 signaling pathway components.
