abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed on 67 non-small-cell
  lung cancers NSCLCs , including 32 squamous cell carcinomas SCCs and 35 adenocarcinomas
  ACs , to identify differences in the patterns of genomic imbalance between these
  two histologic subtypes. Among the entire tumor set, the chromosome arms most often
  overrepresented were 1q, 3q, 5p, and 8q, each detected in 50-55 of cases. The most
  frequently underrepresented arms were 9q, 3p, 8p, and 17p. The number of imbalances
  was similar in SCCs and ACs median number case: 12 and 11, respectively . Moreover,
  many imbalances, such as gains of 1q, 5p, and 8q, occurred at a high frequency in
  both histologic subgroups. Several statistically significant differences, however,
  were found. The most prominent difference was gain of 3q24-qter, seen in 81 of SCCs
  compared with 31 of ACs P amp lt 0.0001 , with amplification at 3q25-26 being detected
  in eight of 32 25 SCCs but in only two of 35 6 ACs. Gain of 20p13 and loss of 4q
  also were seen at a significantly higher rate in SCCs than in ACs, whereas overrepresentation
  of 6p was more common in ACs. Gains of 7q and 8q each were associated with higher-stage
  tumors and either positive nodal involvement or higher tumor grade. These data suggest
  that genes located in several chromosomal regions, particularly 3q25-26, may be
  associated with phenotypic properties that differentiate lung SCCs from ACs. Furthermore,
  certain imbalances, prominent among them gains of 7q and 8q, may be indicative of
  tumor aggressiveness in NSCLCs.'
