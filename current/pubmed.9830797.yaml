abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH allows the study of DNA copy number
  changes in a single hybridization from tumor DNA without any cell culture. Three
  reports of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL studied by CGH have been published
  so far, with somewhat discrepant results. In the present study we performed CGH
  analysis on 36 patients with childhood ALL. The results were compared to those reported
  earlier on 157 cases.
