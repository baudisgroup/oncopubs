abstract: We analyzed a series of young median age 52 years non-smoker lung cancer
  patients and their unaffected siblings as controls, using a genome-wide 620 901
  single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP array analysis and a case-control DNA pooling
  approach. We identified 82 putatively associated SNPs that were retested by individual
  genotyping followed by use of the sib transmission disequilibrium test, pointing
  to 36 SNPs associated with lung cancer risk in the discordant sibs series. Analysis
  of these 36 SNPs in a polygenic model characterized by additive and interchangeable
  effects of rare alleles revealed a highly statistically significant dosage-dependent
  association between risk allele carrier status and proportion of cancer cases. Replication
  of the same 36 SNPs in a population-based series confirmed the association with
  lung cancer for three SNPs, suggesting that phenocopies and genetic heterogeneity
  can play a major role in the complex genetics of lung cancer risk in the general
  population.
