abstract: Chromosomal instability, as assessed by many techniques, including DNA content
  aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, and comparative genomic hybridization, has consistently
  been reported to be common in cancer and rare in normal tissues. Recently, a panel
  of chromosome instability biomarkers, including loss of heterozygosity and DNA content,
  has been reported to identify patients at high and low risk of progression from
  Barretts esophagus BE to esophageal adenocarcinoma EA , but required multiple platforms
  for implementation. Although chromosomal instability involving amplifications and
  deletions of chromosome regions have been observed in nearly all cancers, copy number
  alterations CNA in premalignant tissues have not been well characterized or evaluated
  in cohort studies as biomarkers of cancer risk.
