abstract: 'There is evidence that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease phenotypically
  as well as molecular biologically. So far, heterogeneity on the molecular biological
  level has not been investigated in potential precursor lesions, such as ductal hyperplasia
  DH and ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS . In this study we applied comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue with DH and
  DCIS, adjacent to invasive ductal carcinoma IDC , to screen these potential precursor
  lesions for whole genomic chromosomal imbalances. Laser-microdissection was used
  to select pure cell populations from the sections. Isolated DNA was amplified by
  degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR DOP-PCR and further processed for CGH analysis.
  Investigating multiple samples n 25 from four patients we found an average of 5.6
  - 0.9 mean - SEM chromosomal imbalances already present in DH. In the twelve DCIS
  lesions an average of 10.8 - 0.9 aberrations was identified with 14.8 - 0.8 aberrations
  in the four adjacent IDC lesions. The increasing number of chromosomal changes in
  parallel with the histopathological sequence corroborate the hypothesis, that the
  carcinomas may have developed through a sequential progression from normal to proliferative
  epithelium and eventually into carcinoma. However, heterogeneous results were identified
  in the multiple samples per entity from the same patient, demonstrated mainly in
  the DCIS samples in the chromosomal regions 6p, 9p, 11q, 16p and 17q, in the DH
  samples by 3p, 16p and 17q. This heterogeneous findings were most pronounced within
  the DH and was less in the DCIS and IDC samples. The only aberration consistently
  found in all samples-even in all DH sample-was amplification of the 20q13 region.
  Our results demonstrate, that the applied combination of laser-microdissection,
  DOP-PCR and CGH, may serve to analyse breast carcinogenesis pathways in suitable
  histological material. However, so far, it is unclear how to handle heterogeneous
  results and these make identification of relevant changes more difficult. Setting
  a threshold and evaluating only those chromosomal changes which are present in a
  majority of samples may be one possibility. This involves however, the risk that
  infrequent but possibly significant aberrations may be missed. Figures on http:
