abstract: Causative genetic variants have to date been identified for only a small
  proportion of familial colorectal cancer CRC . While conditions such as Familial
  Adenomatous Polyposis and Lynch syndrome have well defined genetic causes, the search
  for variants underlying the remainder of familial CRC is plagued by genetic heterogeneity.
  The recent identification of families with a heritable predisposition to malignancies
  arising through the serrated pathway familial serrated neoplasia or Jass syndrome
  provides an opportunity to study a subset of familial CRC in which heterogeneity
  may be greatly reduced. A genome-wide linkage screen was performed on a large family
  displaying a dominantly-inherited predisposition to serrated neoplasia genotyped
  using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10 K SNP Array. Parametric and nonparametric
  analyses were performed and resulting regions of interest, as well as previously
  reported CRC susceptibility loci at 3q22, 7q31 and 9q22, were followed up by finemapping
  in 10 serrated neoplasia families. Genome-wide linkage analysis revealed regions
  of interest at 2p25.2-p25.1, 2q24.3-q37.1 and 8p21.2-q12.1. Finemapping linkage
  and haplotype analyses identified 2q32.2-q33.3 as the region most likely to harbour
  linkage, with heterogeneity logarithm of the odds HLOD 2.09 and nonparametric linkage
  NPL score 2.36 P  0.004 . Five primary candidate genes CFLAR, CASP10, CASP8, FZD7
  and BMPR2 were sequenced and no segregating variants identified. There was no evidence
  of linkage to previously reported loci on chromosomes 3, 7 and 9.
