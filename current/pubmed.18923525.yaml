abstract: Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous
  system, accounts for approximately 15 of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk
  neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy,
  relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously
  unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in
  8 of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified
  in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line.
  The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma
  cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but
  not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic
  Ba F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba F3 cells expressing these mutations
  were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 ref. 4 . Furthermore,
  two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive
  to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis
  as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling TUNEL . Short hairpin RNA shRNA
  -mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L
  mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating
  alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma
  tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK
  inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy
  of this disease.
