abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH can reveal important disease genes
  but the large regions identified could sometimes contain hundreds of genes. Here
  we combine high-resolution CGH analysis of 598 human cancer cell lines with insertion
  sites isolated from 1,005 mouse tumors induced with the murine leukemia virus MuLV
  . This cross-species oncogenomic analysis revealed candidate tumor suppressor genes
  and oncogenes mutated in both human and mouse tumors, making them strong candidates
  for novel cancer genes. A significant number of these genes contained binding sites
  for the stem cell transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. Notably, mice carrying tumors
  with insertions in or near stem cell module genes, which are thought to participate
  in cell self-renewal, died significantly faster than mice without these insertions.
  A comparison of the profile we identified to that induced with the Sleeping Beauty
  SB transposon system revealed significant differences in the profile of recurrently
  mutated genes. Collectively, this work provides a rich catalogue of new candidate
  cancer genes for functional analysis.
