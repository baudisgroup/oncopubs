abstract: A subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL is familial. Lack of
  large families makes it attractive to exploit methods in addition to genetic linkage
  analysis for the identification of a susceptibility locus. One strategy that can
  localise regions of the genome that may harbour tumour suppressor genes is to identify
  regions of chromosomal imbalance using comparative genomic hybridisation CGH analysis.
  We examined 24 familial CLL cases by CGH analysis. Losses that are documented as
  arising frequently in sporadic CLL were observed at a comparable frequency in familial
  CLL. However, gains and losses in two regions of the X chromosome - Xp11.2-p21 and
  Xq21-qter - appear more common in familial CLL than in sporadic CLL. This suggests
  these regions may harbour a susceptibility locus for CLL. There is also some evidence
  that chromosome regions 2p12-p14 and 4q11-q21 may harbour predisposition genes.
