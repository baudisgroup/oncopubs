abstract: The sentinel lymph node SLN is considered to be the first axillary node
  that contains malignant cells in metastatic breast tumors, and its positivity is
  currently used in clinical practice as an indication for axillary lymph node dissection.
  Therefore, accurate evaluation of the SLN for the presence of breast metastatic
  cells is essential. The main aim of our study is to characterize the genomic changes
  present in the SLN metastatic samples with the ultimate goal of improving the predictive
  value of SLN evaluation. Twenty paired samples of SLN metastases and their corresponding
  primary breast tumors PBT were investigated for DNA copy number changes using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . Non-random DNA copy number changes were observed in
  all the lesions analyzed, with gains being more common than losses. In 75 of the
  cases there was at least one change common to both PBT and SLN. The most frequent
  changes detected in both lesions were gains of 1pter-- amp gt p32, 16, 17, 19, and
  20 and losses of 6q13-- amp gt q23 and 13q13-- amp gt q32. In the PBT group, alterations
  on chromosomes 1, 16, and 20 were the most frequent, whereas chromosomes 1, 6, and
  19 were the ones with the highest number of changes in the SLN metastatic group.
  A positive correlation was found between the DNA copy number changes per chromosome
  in each of the groups. Our findings indicate the presence of significant DNA copy
  number changes in the SLN metastatic lesions that could be used in the future as
  additional markers to improve the predictive value of SLN biopsy procedure.
