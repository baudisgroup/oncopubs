abstract: Acute megakaryocytic leukemia is a rare subtype of AML that is often difficult
  to diagnose it is most commonly associated with Down syndrome in children. To identify
  chromosomal imbalances and rearrangements associated with acute megakaryocytic leukemia,
  we used G-banding, comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and whole chromosome
  painting WCP on a variety of primary patients samples and leukemia cell lines. The
  most common abnormality was gain of chromosome 19 or arm 19q, which was detected
  by CGH in four of 12 33.3 primary samples and nine of 11 81.8 cell lines. In none
  of the primary samples was this abnormality detected by G-banding analysis. WCP
  was used to define further the nature of the chromosome 19 gain in the cell lines,
  which was found to be due to the presence of additional 19q material on marker chromosomes
  or to cryptic translocations involving 19q. The most common chromosomal loss--detected
  only in the cell lines--was deletion of chromosomal band 13q14, which was seen in
  six of 11 54.5 cell lines. Other recurrent changes included gains of 1p, 6p, 8q,
  11q, 15q, 17q, and 21q and losses of 2, 4q, 5q, 7q, 9p, and 11p. Combining conventional
  and molecular cytogenetic analyses defined recurrent clonal chromosomal abnormalities,
  which will aid in the identification of critical genes that are abnormal in acute
  megakaryocytic leukemia cells.
