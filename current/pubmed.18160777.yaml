abstract: Deletion of the CDKN2A locus at 9p21.3 has been reported to be a poor prognostic
  sign in the Ewing sarcoma family of tumours. In clinical applications CDKN2A deletion
  is primarily detected using fluorescent in situ hybridisation FISH with a commercial
  probe, size approximately 190 kb. Due to limitations in resolution, FISH analysis
  may fail to detect microdeletions smaller than 190 kb. In the present study, we
  performed 44K array comparative genomic hybridisation CGH on eleven Ewing sarcoma
  cell lines and 26 tissue samples in order to define the sizes of 9p21.3 deletions.
  Microarray CGH analysis revealed 9p21.3 deletions encompassing the CDKN2A locus
  in eight cell lines 73 and in six tumours 23 . In four cases two cell lines and
  two tissue samples the deletion was less than 190 kb in size. In one cell line sample,
  we detected a microdeletion of approximately 58 kb in 9p21.3 harbouring the CDKN2A
  locus. We confirmed this result using 244K microarray CGH and TaqMan quantitative
  RT-PCR analysis and further performed FISH analysis on this cell line sample. Here,
  we show that CDKN2A FISH analysis can give false negative results in cases with
  small microdeletions. Our results suggest that new and more accurate FISH methods
  should be developed for detection of deletions in the CDKN2A locus.
