abstract: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that occur
  in the context of inherited cancer syndromes in 30 of cases and are linked to germline
  mutations in the VHL, RET, NF1, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2 and TMEM127 genes.
  Although genome-wide expression studies have revealed some of the mechanisms likely
  to be involved in pheochromocytoma paraganglioma tumorigenesis, the complete molecular
  distinction of all subtypes of hereditary tumors has not been solved and the genetic
  events involved in the generation of sporadic tumors are unknown. With these purposes
  in mind, we investigated 202 pheochromocytomas paragangliomas, including 75 hereditary
  tumors, using expression profiling, BAC array comparative genomic hybridization
  and somatic mutation screening. Gene expression signatures defined the hereditary
  tumors according to their genotype and notably, led to a complete subseparation
  between SDHx- and VHL-related tumors. In tumor tissues, the systematic characterization
  of somatic genetic events associated with germline mutations in tumor suppressor
  genes revealed loss of heterozygosity LOH in a majority of cases, but also detected
  point mutations and copy-neutral LOH. Finally, guided by transcriptome classifications
  and LOH profiles, somatic mutations in VHL or RET genes were identified in 14 of
  sporadic pheochromocytomas paragangliomas. Overall, we found a germline or somatic
  genetic alteration in 45.5 92 202 of the tumors in this large series of pheochromocytomas
  paragangliomas. Regarding mutated genes, specific molecular pathways involved in
  tumorigenesis mechanisms are identified. Altogether, these new findings suggest
  that somatic mutation analysis is likely to yield important clues for personalizing
  molecular targeted therapies.
