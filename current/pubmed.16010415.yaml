abstract: 'A total of 22 acute myeloid leukemia AML cases were analyzed by cell-specific
  comparative genomic hybridization micro-CGH . Conventional banding analysis identified
  a monosomy 7 in six group I , a trisomy 8 in eight group II and a normal karyotype
  in eight cases group III . A total of 32 additional chromosomal imbalances was detected
  and confirmed in two independent micro-CGH experiments. However, only in 9 of the
  22 cases group I: 4 cases group II: 1 case group III: 4 cases the existence of 11
  of the 32 34.5 detected copy number alterations could be confirmed by other fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH approaches. These results lead to two conclusions: i
  in the in vitro non-proliferating population of AML tumor cells one can detect cryptic
  chromosomal aberrations, which might constitute tumor markers of diagnostic and
  prognostic value ii The results of CGH need to be checked by other approaches.'
