abstract: Genetic and epigenetic changes contribute to deregulation of gene expression
  and development of human cancer. Changes in DNA methylation are key epigenetic factors
  regulating gene expression and genomic stability. Recent progress in microarray
  technologies resulted in developments of high resolution platforms for profiling
  of genetic, epigenetic and gene expression changes. OS is a pediatric bone tumor
  with characteristically high level of numerical and structural chromosomal changes.
  Furthermore, little is known about DNA methylation changes in OS. Our objective
  was to develop an integrative approach for analysis of high-resolution epigenomic,
  genomic, and gene expression profiles in order to identify functional epi genomic
  differences between OS cell lines and normal human osteoblasts. A combination of
  Affymetrix Promoter Tilling Arrays for DNA methylation, Agilent array-CGH platform
  for genomic imbalance and Affymetrix Gene 1.0 platform for gene expression analysis
  was used. As a result, an integrative high-resolution approach for interrogation
  of genome-wide tumour-specific changes in DNA methylation was developed. This approach
  was used to provide the first genomic DNA methylation maps, and to identify and
  validate genes with aberrant DNA methylation in OS cell lines. This first integrative
  analysis of global cancer-related changes in DNA methylation, genomic imbalance,
  and gene expression has provided comprehensive evidence of the cumulative roles
  of epigenetic and genetic mechanisms in deregulation of gene expression networks.
