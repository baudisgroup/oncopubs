abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma ranks among the top ten most common cancers
  worldwide. Despite the success in diagnosis and therapy during the past 30 years,
  oral squamous cell carcinoma still belongs to the tumor types with a very unfavorable
  prognosis. In an effort to identify genomic alterations with prognostic relevance,
  we applied the comparative genomic hybridization technique on oral squamous cell
  carcinoma. The tumors exhibited from five up to 47 DNA copy number alterations,
  indicating a considerable degree of genomic imbalance. Out of 35 tumors, 19 showed
  a gain of chromosome band 7p12. Genomic imbalances were investigated by hierarchical
  cluster analysis and clustered image mapping to investigate whether genomic profiles
  correlate with clinical data. Results of the present investigation show that profiling
  of genomic imbalances in general, and especially of the epidermal growth factor
  receptor EGFR on 7p12, may be suitable as prognostic factors. In order to identify
  small-molecule inhibitors for EGFR, we established a database of 531 natural compounds
  derived from medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. Candidate compounds
  were identified by correlation analysis using the Kendall tau-test of IC50 values
  of tumor cell lines and microarray-based EGFR mRNA expression. Further validation
  was performed by molecular docking studies using the AutoDock program with the crystal
  structure of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain as docking template. We estimate these
  results will be a further step toward the ultimate goal of individualized, patient-adapted
  tumor treatment based on tumor molecular profiling.
