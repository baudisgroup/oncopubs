abstract: An unusual case of fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver developed 5 years
  after removal of a hepatocellular adenoma in a 14-year-old girl belonging to a family
  with Carney syndrome. Both tumors were studied by light and electron microscopy,
  flow cytometry, and comparative genomic hybridization. The first tumor, removed
  at the age of 9, was a bulky well-circumscribed liver mass composed of large eosinophilic
  cells with a focal pseudoglandular pattern but without cytologic atypia or sclerosis.
  A diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma was rendered. Five years later, another hepatic
  tumor was removed from the right lobe. Microscopic examination revealed polygonal
  cells, each with a large amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and a round nucleus with
  a conspicuous nucleolus. These cells were arranged in nests and strands and separated
  by bands of dense fibrous tissue, leading to a diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma.
  Comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed no genetic alteration in the
  adenoma however, several chromosomal aberrations loss of chromosome regions 1p and
  4p and gains of chromosome regions 6q, 13q, and Xq were detected in the fibrolamellar
  carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between
  hepatocellular adenoma and fibrolamellar carcinoma.
