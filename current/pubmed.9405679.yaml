abstract: Nineteen benign World Health Organization WHO grade I MI , 21 atypical WHO
  grade II MII , and 19 anaplastic WHO grade III MIII sporadic meningiomas were screened
  for chromosomal imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . These data
  were supplemented by molecular genetic analyses of selected chromosomal regions
  and genes. With increasing malignancy grade, a marked accumulation of genomic aberrations
  was observed i.e., the numbers mean - SEM of total alterations detected per tumor
  were 2.9 - 0.7 for MI, 9.2 - 1.2 for MII, and 13.3 - 1.9 for MIII. The most frequent
  alteration detected in MI was loss on 22q 58 . In MII, aberrations most commonly
  identified were losses on 1p 76 , 22q 71 , 14q 43 , 18q 43 , 10 38 , and 6q 33 ,
  as well as gains on 20q 48 , 12q 43 , 15q 43 , 1q 33 , 9q 33 , and 17q 33 . In MIII,
  most of these alterations were found at similar frequencies. However, an increase
  in losses on 6q 53 , 10 68 , and 14q 63 was observed. In addition, 32 of MIII demonstrated
  loss on 9p. Homozygous deletions in the CDKN2A gene at 9p21 were found in 4 of 16
  MIII 25 . Highly amplified DNA sequences were mapped to 12q13-q15 by CGH in 1 MII.
  Southern blot analysis of this tumor revealed amplification of CDK4 and MDM2. By
  CGH, DNA sequences from 17q were found to be amplified in 1 MII and 8 MIII, involving
  17q23 in all cases. Despite the high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the
  MII and MIII investigated, none of these tumors showed mutations in exons 5-8 of
  the TP53 gene. On the basis of the most common aberrations identified in the various
  malignancy grades, a model for the genomic alterations associated with meningioma
  progression is proposed.
