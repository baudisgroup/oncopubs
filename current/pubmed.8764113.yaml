abstract: The DNA copy number changes were investigated in 13 malignant, 3 borderline,
  and 16 benign gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs by comparative genomic hybridization.
  A consistent finding was the loss of DNA copy numbers in chromosome 14q. This was
  detected in 75 of the benign tumors, in 62 of the malignant tumors, and in two out
  of the three borderline tumors with a minimal overlapping region located to 14q22.
  Losses of DNA copy numbers were more frequent than gains, with 2-10 changes in malignant
  GISTs and 1-3 changes in benign tumors. High-level DNA amplifications, detected
  only in malignant GISTs, were assigned to 3q26-q29 40 , 5p 30 , and 8q22-24 40 .
  Our results indicate that copy number losses in 14q are an early change during oncogenesis
  of GISTs and suggest the possibility that a new tumor suppressor gene at 14q22 might
  be involved in the regulation of differentiation or proliferation of such mesenchymal
  cells.
