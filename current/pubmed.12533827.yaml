abstract: Hyperplasia of usual type HUT is part of the spectrum of benign proliferative
  disease in the breast and confers an increased risk of developing invasive cancer.
  Its role as a putative precursor of invasive ductal carcinomas in the breast is,
  however, controversial. HUT is occasionally seen bilaterally but it is not clear
  whether there is a genetic predisposition to the process. This study has analysed
  14 cases of bilateral HUT in the breast 28 independent lesions by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH analysis to define DNA copy number changes and to investigate
  any commonality in these genetic alterations. The mean number of alterations seen
  was 1.6 46 28 in all lesions, with common losses at chromosomes 1p, 16p, 17q, and
  22q. Bilaterally, only five alterations were seen in common across both lesions
  in both breasts, but no single locus was altered preferentially. These data indicate
  that a proportion of HUT in the breast are indeed clonal, neoplastic proliferations
  which exhibit genetic alterations in common with invasive breast cancer, albeit
  at very low levels. The limited data from these experiments do not reveal a specific
  predisposition locus.
