abstract: We have used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to survey genomic regions
  with aberrant copy numbers of DNA sequences in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In 12
  cell lines and 6 primary tumors from 18 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas,
  highly frequent losses amp gt 60 were observed on chromosome arms 6q, 9p, and 18q
  and the Y chromosome. Moderately frequent losses 40-60 were observed on chromosome
  arms 3p, 4q, 8p, and 21q. Interestingly, these samples showed extremely high frequencies
  of increases in copy numbers of DNA sequences on the long arm of chromosome 20 15
  18, 83 . We further analyzed five cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH with probes on chromosome 20 to define the increase in copy number more accurately,
  and we found that 20q was increased to between 5 and 8 copies per cell. These results
  suggest the existence of an oncogene or oncogenes in 20q that play a role in the
  development and or the progression of pancreatic carcinogenesis.
