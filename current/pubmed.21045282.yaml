abstract: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and little is known about its
  etiopathogenesis. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method
  to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number and to map them directly
  onto the complete linear genome sequences. The aim of this study was to investigate
  DNA imbalances by aCGH and compare them with a female breast cancer dataset.We used
  Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 44B and 44K to compare genomic alterations
  in 25 male breast cancer tissues studied at NCC of Bari and 16 female breast cancer
  deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE12659). Data analysis was performed
  with Nexus Copy Number 5.0 software.All the 25 male and 16 female breast cancer
  samples displayed some chromosomal instability (110.93 alterations per patient in
  female, 69 in male). However, male samples presented a lower frequency of genetic
  alterations both in terms of loss and gains.aCGH is an effective tool for analysis
  of cytogenetic aberrations in MBC, which involves different biological processes
  than female. Male most significant altered regions contained genes involved in cell
  communication, cell division and immunological response, while female cell-cell
  junction maintenance, regulation of transcription and neuron development.
