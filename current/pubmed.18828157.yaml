abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme shows multiple chromosomal aberrations, the impact
  of which on gene expression remains unclear. To investigate this relationship and
  to identify putative initiating genomic events, we integrated a paired copy number
  and gene expression survey in glioblastoma using whole human genome arrays. Loci
  of recurrent copy number alterations were combined with gene expression profiles
  obtained on the same tumor samples. We identified a set of 406 amp quot cis-acting
  DNA targeted genes amp quot corresponding to genomic aberrations with direct copy-number-driving
  changes in gene expression, defined as genes with either significantly concordant
  or correlated changes in DNA copy number and expression. Functional annotation revealed
  that these genes participate in key processes of cancer cell biology, providing
  insights into the genetic mechanisms driving glioblastoma. The robustness of the
  gene selection was validated on an external microarray data set including 81 glioblastomas
  and 23 non-neoplastic brain samples. The integration of array CGH and gene expression
  data highlights a robust cis-acting DNA targeted genes signature that may be critical
  for glioblastoma progression, with two tumor suppressor genes PCDH9 and STARD13
  that could be involved in tumor invasiveness and resistance to etoposide.
