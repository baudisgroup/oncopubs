abstract: In the current study the authors attempted to evaluate genetic alterations
  in a large set of primary ovarian carcinomas and to compare the genetic findings
  with clinical parameters such as grade of tumor differentiation. This strategy was
  applied to identify chromosomal regions containing genes associated with tumor progression.
