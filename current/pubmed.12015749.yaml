abstract: Ependymal tumours ETs are gliomas that arise from the ependymal lining of
  the cerebral ventricles and from the remnants of the central canal of the spinal
  cord. Both clinical and genetic studies suggest that distinct genetic subtypes of
  ETs exist, the subtypes being correlated with patient age and or tumour site. In
  the present study, the tumour genome of 20 ETs 15 adult and five paediatric cases
  was screened for chromosomal imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . The most frequently detected imbalances were -22q 75 , -10q 65 , -21 50 , -16p
  50 , -1p 45 , 4q 45 , -10p 45 , -2q 40 , -6 40 , -19 40 , -2p 35 , -3p 35 , and
  -16q 35 . Comparison of the chromosomal imbalances detected in ETs with those previously
  reported in oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumours revealed that in this respect
  ETs show similarities to these other gliomas. By combining these results with those
  of a recent study of Zheng et al. and Hirose et al., it was found that although
  ETs from different sites and from adult and paediatric patients show overlap at
  the CGH level, some chromosomal imbalances occur predominantly in a certain category.
  In adult patients, spinal ETs relatively often showed 2, 7, 12, and -14q infratentorial
  ETs -22 and supratentorial ETs -9. In addition, in posterior fossa ETs, -6 and 9
  were much more frequent in adults than in children. It is concluded that the genetic
  background of ETs is complex and partly determined by tumour site, histopathological
  subtype, and age of the patient.
