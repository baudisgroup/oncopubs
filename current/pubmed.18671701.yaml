abstract: Several tumour suppressor genes TSG have been identified as a result of
  mapping homozygous deletions in cancer cells. To identify putative TSG involved
  in the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma cHL , we investigated four cHL
  cell lines L428, HDLM2, KMH2, L1236 using four different array-Comparative Genomic
  Hybridisation array-CGH platforms and focused on high resolution identification
  of homozygous deletions. Out of 79 candidate regions of bi-allelic loss identified
  by array-CGH, besides previously described regions, 28 novel regions of homozygous
  deletions could be verified by polymerase chain reaction. These regions ranged from
  13 kb to 619 kb in size. Eleven of the 28 novel bi-allelic losses were putative
  copy number polymorphisms. This left 17 regions that might harbour novel tumour
  suppressors involved in Hodgkin lymphoma. Expression profiling with two different
  platforms confirmed lack of expression of the majority of the genes located in the
  homozygous deletions. Furthermore, analysis of ontology annotations of genes located
  in the homozygously deleted regions indicated an enrichment of genes involved in
  apoptosis and cell death. In summary, through the mapping of homozygous deletions
  in cell lines this study identified a series of genes, such as SEPT9, GNG7 and CYBB,
  which might encode candidate tumour suppressors involved in the pathogenesis of
  cHL.
