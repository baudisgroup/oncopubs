abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH provides a genome-wide technique
  for identifying chromosomal aberrations in human diseases, including cancer. Chromosomal
  aberrations in cancers are defined as regions that contain an increased or decreased
  DNA copy number, relative to normal samples. The identification of genomic regions
  associated with systematic aberrations provides insights into initiation and progression
  of cancer, and improves diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy strategies. The McNemar
  test can be used to detect differentially expressed genes after discretization of
  gene expressions in a microarray experiment for the matched dataset. In this study,
  we propose a method to detect significantly altered DNA regions, shifted McNemar
  test, which is based on the standard McNemar test and takes into account changes
  in copy number variations and the region size throughout the whole genome. In addition,
  this novel method can be used to detect genomic regions associated with the progress
  of oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC . The performance of the proposed method was
  evaluated based on the homogeneity within the selected regions and the classification
  accuracies of the selected regions. This method might be useful for identifying
  new candidate genes that neighbor known genes based on the whole-genomic variation
  because it detects significant chromosomal regions, not independent probes.
