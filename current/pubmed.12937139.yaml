abstract: Amplification of chromosomal regions leads to an increase of DNA copy numbers
  and expression of oncogenes in many human tumors. The identification of tumor-specific
  oncogene targets has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. To identify
  distinct spectra of oncogenic alterations in ovarian carcinoma, metaphase comparative
  genomic hybridization mCGH , array CGH aCGH , and ovarian tumor tissue microarrays
  were used in this study. Twenty-six primary ovarian carcinomas and three ovarian
  carcinoma cell lines were analyzed by mCGH. Frequent chromosomal overrepresentation
  was observed on 2q 31 , 3q 38 , 5p 38 , 8q 52 , 11q 21 , 12p 21 , 17q 21 , and 20q
  52 . The role of oncogenes residing in gained chromosomal loci was determined by
  aCGH with 59 genetic loci commonly amplified in human tumors. DNA copy number gains
  were most frequently observed for PIK3CA on 3q 66 , PAK1 on 11q 59 , KRAS2 on 12p
  55 , and STK15 on 20q 55 . The 11q13-q14 amplicon, represented by six oncogenes
  CCND1, FGF4, FGF3, EMS1, GARP, and PAK1 revealed preferential gene copy number gains
  of PAK1, which is located at 11q13.5-q14. Amplification and protein expression status
  of both PAK1 and CCND1 were further examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  and immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray consisting of 268 primary ovarian
  tumors. PAK1 copy number gains were observed in 30 of the ovarian carcinomas and
  PAK1 protein was expressed in 85 of the tumors. PAK1 gains were associated with
  high grade P amp lt 0.05 . In contrast, CCND1 gene alterations and protein expression
  were less frequent 10.6 and 25 , respectively , suggesting that the critical oncogene
  target of amplicon 11q13-14 lies distal to CCND1. This study demonstrates that aCGH
  facilitates further characterization of oncogene candidates residing in amplicons
  defined by mCGH.
