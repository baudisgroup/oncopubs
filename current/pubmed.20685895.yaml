abstract: Intimal sarcoma IS is a rare, malignant, and aggressive tumor that shows
  a relentless course with a concomitant low survival rate and for which no effective
  treatment is available. In this study, 21 cases of large arterial blood vessel IS
  were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization and
  selectively by karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization, sequencing,
  phospho-kinase antibody arrays, and Western immunoblotting in search for novel diagnostic
  markers and potential molecular therapeutic targets. Ex vivo immunoassays were applied
  to test the sensitivity of IS primary tumor cells to the receptor tyrosine kinase
  RTK inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib. We showed that amplification of platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor alpha PDGFRA is a common finding in IS, which should be considered
  as a molecular hallmark of this entity. This amplification is consistently associated
  with PDGFRA activation. Furthermore, the tumors reveal persistent activation of
  the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR , concurrent to PDGFRA activation. Activated
  PDGFRA and EGFR frequently coexist with amplification and overexpression of the
  MDM2 oncogene. Ex vivo immunoassays on primary IS cells from one case showed the
  potency of dasatinib to inhibit PDGFRA and downstream signaling pathways. Our findings
  provide a rationale for investigating therapies that target PDGFRA, EGFR, or MDM2
  in IS. Given the clonal heterogeneity of this tumor type and the potential cross-talk
  between the PDGFRA and EGFR signaling pathways, targeting multiple RTKs and aberrant
  downstream effectors might be required to improve the therapeutic outcome for patients
  with this disease.
