abstract: Multiple chromosomal imbalances have been identified in breast cancer using
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Their association with the primary tumors
  potential for building distant metastases is unknown. In this study we have investigated
  39 invasive breast carcinomas with a mean follow-up period of 99 months max. 193
  months by CGH to determine the prognostic value of chromosomal gains and losses.
  The mean number of chromosomal imbalances per tumor was 6.5 -0.7 range 2 to 18 .
  The most frequent alterations identified in more than 1 3 of cases were gains on
  chromosomes 11q13, 12q24, 16, 17, and 20q, and losses on 2q and 13q. A significantly
  different frequency of chromosomal aberrations p amp lt or 0.05 was found between
  DNA-diploid and non-diploid tumors gain on chromosome 17 . Differences were also
  noted between tumors progressing to distant metastases within the period of follow-up
  and those which do not gains on 11q13 and 12q24 loss on 12q . Significant univariate
  correlations p amp lt or 0.05 with the metastasis-free survival of patients were
  found for lymph node status, the cytometrical determined DNA ploidy diploid non-diploid
  and anisokaryosis, and for DNA gains on 11q13, 12q24, 17, and 18p. An unexpected
  inverse correlation was found between clinical outcome and gains on 11q13 and 12q24.
  In multivariate analysis independent prognostic value, in addition to lymph node
  status, was found for chromosomal gains on 11q13, 12q24, 17 and 18p. Amplification
  on 20q, which did not correlate with metastasis-free survival in a univariate analysis,
  showed weak prognostic significance in combination with the nodal status. The prognostic
  value of chromosomal alterations - some of them by inverse correlation - suggests
  an interaction and or compensation of the involved amplified genes and their effects
  on the occurrence of distant metastases in breast cancer patients.
