abstract: Tumors are typically sequenced to depths of 75-100ï¿½ (exome) or 30-50ï¿½
  (whole genome). We demonstrate that current sequencing paradigms are inadequate
  for tumors that are impure, aneuploid or clonally heterogeneous. To reassess optimal
  sequencing strategies, we performed ultra-deep (up to ~312ï¿½) whole genome sequencing
  (WGS) and exome capture (up to ~433ï¿½) of a primary acute myeloid leukemia, its
  subsequent relapse, and a matched normal skin sample. We tested multiple alignment
  and variant calling algorithms and validated ~200,000 putative SNVs by sequencing
  them to depths of ~1,000ï¿½. Additional targeted sequencing provided over 10,000ï¿½
  coverage and ddPCR assays provided up to ~250,000ï¿½ sampling of selected sites.
  We evaluated the effects of different library generation approaches, depth of sequencing,
  and analysis strategies on the ability to effectively characterize a complex tumor.
  This dataset, representing the most comprehensively sequenced tumor described to
  date, will serve as an invaluable community resource (dbGaP accession id phs000159).
