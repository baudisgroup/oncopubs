abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was applied to 35 neuroblastomas to
  obtain a global view of genetic imbalances. Results were validated by means of Southern
  blot hybridization detection of N-myc amplification , loss of heterozygosity LOH
  studies detection of deletion 1p , and interphase cytogenetics dual labelling fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH of centromeric 17 and erbB-2 . CGH allowed sensitive
  detection of N-myc amplification and chromosome 1p deletion, representing the most
  established prognostic markers of neuroblastoma. In addition, a high rate of chromosome
  17 aberrations 63 per cent with possible prognostic relevance was observed. Previously
  unreported high level copy number increases indicating oncogene amplification were
  mapped to chromosome subbands 2p13-14 and 3q24-26. Other recurrent regional chromosomal
  aberrations were localized on 11q, 12q, 13q, 14q, and 15q. CGH results were fully
  consistent with data of Southern blot analysis and LOH study, as well as interphase
  cytogenetics. These results show that CGH is a sensitive method for the detection
  of all prognostically relevant genetic alterations in neuroblastomas that CGH considerably
  simplifies the detection of these alterations, resulting in a single methodological
  approach and that CGH is a powerful tool to elucidate previously unknown genetic
  changes in neuroblastomas.
