abstract: The metastatic process is complex and remains a major obstacle in the management
  of colorectal cancer. To gain a better insight into the pathology of metastasis,
  we investigated genomic aberrations in a large cohort of matched colorectal cancer
  primaries and distant metastases from various sites by high resolution array comparative
  genomic hybridization. In total, 62 primary colorectal cancers, and 68 matched metastases
  (22 liver, 11 lung, 12 ovary, 12 omentum, and 11 distant lymph nodes) were analyzed.
  Public datasets were used for validation purposes. Metastases resemble their matched
  primary tumors in the majority of the patients. This validates the significant overlap
  in chromosomal aberrations between primary tumors and corresponding metastases observed
  previously. We observed 15 statistically significant different regions between the
  primary tumors and their matched metastases, of which only one recurrent event in
  metastases was observed. We conclude, based on detailed analysis and large independent
  datasets, that chromosomal copy number aberrations in colorectal metastases resemble
  their primary counterparts, and differences are typically non-recurrent.
