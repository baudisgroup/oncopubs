abstract: Sclerosing pseudovascular rhabdomyosarcoma in adults has been described
  as a rare variant of rhabdomyosarcoma characterized by extensive hyaline fibrosis
  and pseudovascular growth patterns. We describe another case of this rhabdomyosarcoma
  subtype including ultrastructural and genetic findings-the lesion presented in a
  62-year-old male patient in the left lower leg. The tumor was located within the
  deep soft tissue with maximum diameter of 11.8 cm and skin ulceration. Ultrastructural
  analysis revealed irregularly distributed disorganized filaments without clear evidence
  of Z-bands and a richly collagenized matrix. Using comparative genomic hybridization,
  a sharply delineated loss of chromosomal region 10q22, loss of chromosome Y, and
  a gain of chromosome 18 trisomy were detected. Reciprocal translocations t 1 13
  and t 2 13 q35 q14 which are characteristic of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma could be
  excluded. These findings, while showing a relation to other rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes,
  represent a relatively circumscribed genetic defect pattern in sclerosing pseudovascular
  rhabdomyosarcoma that is somewhat different from patterns described in most other
  rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. Six months after tumor resection, the patient presented
  with metastatic disease. Further studies should concentrate on the identification
  of genes especially on chromosomal region 10q22 to elucidate more aspects in the
  pathogenesis of this rhabdomyosarcoma subtype.
