abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a recent molecular cytogenetic
  method that detects and localizes gains or losses in DNA copy number across the
  entire tumor genome. We used CGH to examine 9 glioma cell lines and 20 primary and
  10 recurrent glioblastoma tumors. More than 25 of the primary tumors had gains on
  chromosome 7 they also had frequent losses on 9p, 10, 13 and Y. The losses on chromosome
  13 included several interstitial deletions, with a common area of loss of 13q21.
  The recurrent tumors not only had gains on chromosome 7 and losses on 9p, 10, 13
  and Y but also frequent losses on 6 and 14. One recurrent tumor had a deletion of
  10q22-26. Cell lines showed gains of 5p, 7 and Xp frequent amplifications at 8q22-24.2,
  7q21-32 and 3q26.2-29 and frequent losses on 4, 10, 13, 14 and Y. Because primary
  and recurrent tumors and cell lines showed abnormalities of DNA copy number on chromosomes
  7, 10, 13 and Y, these regions may play a fundamental role in tumor initiation and
  or progression. The propensity for losses on chromosomes 6 and 14 to occur in recurrent
  tumors suggests that these aberrations play a role in tumor recurrence, the development
  of resistance to therapy or both. Analysis of common areas of loss and gain in these
  tumors and cell lines provides a basis for future attempts to more finely map these
  genetic changes.
