abstract: By means of comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we screened 58 primary
  gastric cancers for changes in copy number of DNA sequences. We detected frequent
  losses on Ip32-33 21 , 3p21-23 22 , 5q14-22 36 , 6q16 26 , 9p21-24 22 , 16q 21 ,
  17p13 48 , 18q11-21 33 , and 19 40 . Gains were most often noted at I p36 22 , 8p22-23
  24 , 8q23-24 29 , 11q12-13 24 , 16p 21 , 20p 38 , 20q 45 , Xp21-22 38 , and Xq21-23
  43 , with high-level amplifications at 6p21 2 ,7q31 10 , 8p22-23 5 , 8q23-24 7 ,
  11q13 4 , 12p12-13 4 , 17q21 2 , 19q12-13 2 , and 20q13 2 . High-level amplification
  at 8p22-23 has never been reported in any other cancer type and its frequency was
  as high as that reported for the MYC, MET, and KRAS genes. We narrowed down the
  smallest common amplicon to 8p23.1 by reverse-painting FISH to prophase chromosomes.
  Southern blot analysis using one EST marker D38736 clearly demonstrated that amplification
  of this exon-like sequence had occurred in all three tumors in which amplifications
  at 8p22-23 had been detected by CGH. Our data provide evidence for several, previously
  undescribed, genomic aberrations that are characteristic of gastric cancers.
