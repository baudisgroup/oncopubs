abstract: In this study, we genetically characterized parathyroid adenomas with large
  glandular weights, for which independent observations suggest pronounced clinical
  manifestations. Large parathyroid adenomas (LPTAs) were defined as the 5% largest
  sporadic parathyroid adenomas identified among the 590 cases operated in our institution
  during 2005-2009. The LPTA group showed a higher relative number of male cases and
  significantly higher levels of total plasma and ionized serum calcium (P<0.001).
  Further analysis of 21 LPTAs revealed low MIB1 proliferation index (0.1-1.5%), MEN1
  mutations in five cases, and one HRPT2 (CDC73) mutation. Total or partial loss of
  parafibromin expression was observed in ten tumors, two of which also showed loss
  of APC expression. Using array CGH, we demonstrated recurrent copy number alterations
  most frequently involving loss in 1p (29%), gain in 5 (38%), and loss in 11q (33%).
  Totally, 21 minimal overlapping regions were defined for losses in 1p, 7q, 9p, 11,
  and 15q and gains in 3q, 5, 7p, 8p, 16q, 17p, and 19q. In addition, 12 tumors showed
  gross alterations of entire or almost entire chromosomes most frequently gain of
  5 and loss of chromosome 11. While gain of 5 was the most frequent alteration observed
  in LPTAs, it was only detected in a small proportion (4/58 cases, 7%) of parathyroid
  adenomas. A significant positive correlation was observed between parathyroid hormone
  level and total copy number gain (r=0.48, P=0.031). These results support that LPTAs
  represent a group of patients with pronounced parathyroid hyperfunction and associated
  with specific genomic features.
