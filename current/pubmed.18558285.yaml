abstract: The novel continuous cell line WT-Pe.1 was established in vitro from Wilms
  tumor with histological features of diffuse anaplasia. The cultures grew as poorly
  differentiated epithelial-like cells with pleomorphic polygonal shapes and formation
  of typical monolayers. WT-Pe.1 cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin, vimentin,
  laminin, villin, CD10, and CD24 proteins. Conventional cytogenetic analysis by RHG-banding
  revealed a hypotriploid karyotype with numerous abnormalities including ring chromosomes,
  double-minutes, homogeneous staining regions, radial structures, dicentrics, and
  several marker chromosomes. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed
  DNA copy numbers losses on chromosome segments 1p, 3p, 6q, 9q34.1 approximately
  q34.3, 11q24 approximately q25, 14q12 approximately qter, 16q, 18q, and 22q11 approximately
  q13 gain of genomic material was localized on chromosome arms 1q, 4p, 6q, and 7p
  and the entire chromosome 12. With DNA from the original tumor, copy number losses
  were detected on chromosomes 1p, 14q, 16q, 17q, and 22q and gains were observed
  on 1q, 4p, 8q, 12p, 12q, and chromosome 14p. Copy number amplifications of distinct
  loci were found on 1q21.1 and 4p15.3, as well as an elevated copy number of cyclin
  D2 CCND2 and cyclin D associated kinase CDK4 genes on chromosome 12 confirmed by
  fluorescence in situ hybridization .
