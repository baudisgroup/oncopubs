abstract: 'B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-CLL is characterized by a highly
  variable clinical course. Recurrent chromosomal imbalances provide significant prognostic
  markers. Risk-adapted therapy based on genomic alterations has become an option
  that is currently being tested in clinical trials. To supply a robust tool for such
  large scale studies, we developed a comprehensive DNA microarray dedicated to the
  automated analysis of recurrent genomic imbalances in B-CLL by array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization matrix-CGH . Validation of this chip in a series of 106 B-CLL
  cases revealed a high specificity and sensitivity that fulfils the criteria for
  application in clinical oncology. This chip is immediately applicable within clinical
  B-CLL treatment trials that evaluate whether B-CLL cases with distinct chromosomal
  abnormalities should be treated with chemotherapy of different intensities and or
  stem cell transplantation. Through the control set of DNA fragments equally distributed
  over the genome, recurrent genomic imbalances were discovered: trisomy of chromosome
  19 and gain of the MYCN oncogene correlating with an elevation of MYCN mRNA expression.'
