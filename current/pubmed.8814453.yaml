abstract: A series of 18 primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETs , the most common
  malignant central nervous system tumors of childhood, were analyzed with the recently
  developed approach of comparative genomic hybridization CGH . In five cases, in
  which only small amounts of DNA were available, universal polymerase chain reaction
  was successfully applied to generate adequate probe material. In 15 tumors, chromosomal
  imbalances were elicited, most frequently involving chromosome 17 loss of 17p and
  gain of 17q . Further recurrent imbalances included gains of the distal regions
  of 4p, 5p, 5q, 7q, 8q, and 9p. High-level amplifications were found on 2p24 one
  case and 8q24 three cases , suggesting involvement of the protooncogenes MYCN and
  MYC, respectively. In one of these cases, Southern blot analysis could be performed,
  proving high-copy-number amplification of MYC. Interestingly, none of the three
  patients with high-copy-number amplifications of MYC responded to therapy.
