abstract: Aberrant activation of tyrosine kinases, caused by either mutation or gene
  fusion, is of major importance for the development of many hematologic malignancies,
  particularly myeloproliferative neoplasms. We hypothesized that hitherto unrecognized,
  cytogenetically cryptic tyrosine kinase fusions may be common in non-classical or
  atypical myeloproliferative neoplasms and related myelodysplastic myeloproliferative
  neoplasms.
