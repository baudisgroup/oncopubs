abstract: Twenty lipomatous tumors, including eight lipoma-like liposarcomas and 12
  benign lipomas, were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . DNA
  sequence copy number changes detected in five lipoma-like liposarcomas mean, 1.1
  aberrations tumor range, 0-2 consisted of gains of 12q13-21 five tumors and 1q21-23
  four tumors . Two of the tumors showed high-level amplification at 12q14-21 and
  one tumor at 1q21-22. No copy number changes were found in lipomas. Overrepresentation
  of 1q and 12q sequences was a recurrent finding in lipoma-like liposarcomas but
  not in lipomas. Thus, CGH may help in the differential diagnosis of low-grade or
  borderline adipose neoplasms.
