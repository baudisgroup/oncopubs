abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most frequent-occurring malignant
  tumours worldwide, but molecular changes of tumour DNA, with the exception of viral
  integrations and p53 mutations, are poorly understood. In order to search for common
  macro-imbalances of genomic tumour DNA, 21 HCCs and 3 HCC-cell lines were characterized
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , subsequent database analyses and in selected
  cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . Chromosomal subregions of 1q,
  8q, 17q and 20q showed frequent gains of genomic material, while losses were most
  prevalent in subregions of 4q, 6q, 13q and 16q. Deleted regions encompass tumour
  suppressor genes, like RB-1 and the cadherin gene cluster, some of them previously
  identified as potential target genes in HCC development. Several potential growth-
  or transformation-promoting genes located in chromosomal subregions showed frequent
  gains of genomic material. The present study provides a basis for further genomic
  and expression analyses in HCCs and in addition suggests chromosome 4q to carry
  a so far unidentified tumour suppressor gene relevant for HCC development.
