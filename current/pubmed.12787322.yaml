abstract: The atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour AT RT is an uncommon tumour of the
  central nervous system in children, characterized by the presence of a rhabdoid
  cell component associated with variable combinations of primitive neuroectodermal
  tumour, mesenchymal and epithelial differentiation. Immunohistochemistry reveals
  a complex pattern of antigen expression and cytogenetic studies have demonstrated
  losses from chromosome 22. We have performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  on paraffin-embedded material from three cases of AT RT. Two cases showed losses
  from chromosome 22 associated with other chromosome imbalances including losses
  from 1p in both cases. The third case demonstrated a loss from 8p as the sole abnormality.
  While monosomy or deletion from chromosome 22 is a useful diagnostic marker for
  AT RT, it is not present in all cases. The variation in cytogenetic patterns reported
  for this tumour type raises the possibility that different genetic pathways may
  underlie this tumour phenotype and warrants the further definition of the cytogenetic
  spectrum for this rare tumour.
