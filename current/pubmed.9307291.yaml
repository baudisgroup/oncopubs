abstract: We analyzed 27 samples of primary medulloblastoma, using comparative genomic
  hybridization and a novel statistical approach to evaluate chromosomal regions for
  significant gain or loss of genomic DNA. An array of nonrandom changes was found
  in most samples. Two discrete regions of high-level DNA amplification of chromosome
  bands 5p15.3 and 11q22.3 were observed in 3 of 27 tumors. Nonrandom genomic losses
  were most frequent in regions on chromosomes 10q 41 of samples , 11 41 , 16q 37
  , 17p 37 , and 8p 33 . Regions of DNA gain most often involved chromosomes 17q 48
  and 7 44 . These findings suggest a greater degree of genomic imbalance in medulloblastoma
  than has been recognized previously and highlight chromosomal loci likely to contain
  oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis
  of this tumor.
