abstract: 'When compared with other epithelial ovarian cancers, the clinical characteristics
  of ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCC) include 1) a higher incidence among Japanese,
  2) an association with endometriosis, 3) poor prognosis in advanced stages, and
  4) a higher incidence of thrombosis as a complication. We used high resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization (CGH) to identify somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs)
  associated with each of these clinical characteristics of CCC. The Human Genome
  CGH 244A Oligo Microarray was used to examine 144 samples obtained from 120 Japanese,
  15 Korean, and nine German patients with CCC. The entire 8q chromosome (minimum
  corrected p-value: q = 0.0001) and chromosome 20q13.2 including the ZNF217 locus
  (q = 0.0078) were amplified significantly more in Japanese than in Korean or German
  samples. This copy number amplification of the ZNF217 gene was confirmed by quantitative
  real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). ZNF217 RNA levels were also higher
  in Japanese tumor samples than in non-Japanese samples (P = 0.027). Moreover, endometriosis
  was associated with amplification of EGFR gene (q = 0.047), which was again confirmed
  by Q-PCR and correlated with EGFR RNA expression. However, no SCNAs were significantly
  associated with prognosis or thrombosis. These results indicated that there may
  be an association between CCC and ZNF217 amplification among Japanese patients as
  well as between endometriosis and EGFR gene amplifications.'
