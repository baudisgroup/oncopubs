abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used in parallel with fluorescence
  in-situ hybridization FISH and conventional karyotyping to perform a genome-wide
  survey of DNA gains and losses in the endometriosis-derived permanent cell line,
  FbEM-1. The cytogenetic analysis showed a complex karyotype with numerical changes
  and multiple chromosome aberrations, including the der 1 complement marker exhibiting
  a large homogenous staining region HSR . The chromosomal rearrangement interpreted
  as der 5 t 5 6 q34 p11 was found in the majority of the metaphases indicating a
  clonal abnormality. Repeated CGH experiments demonstrated over-representation of
  chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6p, 7, 16, 17q, 20, 21q and 22q, while chromosomes 6q, 9,
  11p, 12, 13q, 18 and X were under-represented. Using DNA from the original endometriotic
  tissues, including a peritoneal implant and ovarian endometrioma, CGH analysis revealed
  loss of DNA copy number on 1p, 22q and chromosome X, while gain was found on chromosomal
  arms 6p and 17q. FISH analysis confirmed that the gain at 17q includes amplification
  of the proto-oncogene HER-2 neu in 16 of the FbEM-1 nuclei and in 12 of cells from
  the primary ovarian endometrioma tissue. These findings demonstrate that FbEM-1
  cells share certain molecular cytogenetic features with the original tissue and
  suggest that chromosomal instability is important in the development of endometriosis.
