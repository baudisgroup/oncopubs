abstract: In an attempt to define genomic copy number changes associated with the
  development of basal cell carcinoma, we investigated 15 sporadic tumors by comparative
  genomic hybridization. With the incorporation of tissue microdissection and degenerate
  oligonucleotide primed-polymerase chain reaction we were able to isolate, and then
  universally amplify, DNA from the tumor type. This combined approach allows the
  investigation of chromosomal imbalances within a histologically distinct region
  of tissue. Using comparative genomic hybridization we have observed novel and recurrent
  chromosomal gains at 6p 47 , 6q 20 , 9p 20 , 7 13 , and X 13 . In addition comparative
  genomic hybridization revealed regional loss on 9q in 33 of tested tumors encompassing
  9q22.3 to which the putative tumor suppressor gene, Patched, has been mapped. The
  deletion of Patched has been indicated in the development of hereditary and sporadic
  basal cell carcinomas. The identification of these recurrent genetic aberrations
  suggests that basal cell carcinomas may not be as genetically stable as previously
  thought. Further investigation of these regions may lead to the identification of
  other genes responsible for basal cell carcinoma formation.
