abstract: We screened 26 ependymomas in 22 patients 7 WHO grade I, myxopapillary,
  myE 6 WHO grade II, E 13 WHO grade III, anaplastic, aE using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . 25 out of 26 tumors
  showed chromosomal imbalances on CGH analysis. The chromosomal region most frequently
  affected by losses of genomic material clustered on 13q 9 26 . 6 7 myE showed a
  loss on 13q14-q31. Other chromosomes affected by genomic losses were 6q 5 26 , 4q
  5 26 , 10 5 26 , and 2q 4 26 . The most consistent chromosomal abnormality in ependymomas
  so far reported, is monosomy 22 or structural abnormality 22q, identified in approximately
  one third of Giemsa-banded cases with abnormal karyotypes. Using FISH, loss or monosomy
  22q was detected in small subpopulations of tumor cells in 36 of cases. The most
  frequent gains involved chromosome arms 17 8 26 , 9q 7 26 , 20q 7 26 , and 22q 6
  26 . Gains on 1q were found exclusively in pediatric ependymomas 5 10 . Using FISH,
  MYCN proto-oncogene DNA amplifications mapped to 2p23-p24 were found in 2 spinal
  ependymomas of adults. On average, myE demonstrated 9.14, E 5.33, and aE 1.77 gains
  and or losses on different chromosomes per tumor using CGH. Thus, and quite paradoxically,
  in ependymomas, a high frequency of imbalanced chromosomal regions as revealed by
  CGH does not indicate a high WHO grade of the tumor but is more frequent in grade
  I tumors.
