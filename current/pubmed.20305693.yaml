abstract: 'Sporadic adrenocortical tumours are common, but their pathogenesis is poorly
  elucidated. In this study, we present a meta-analysis and review of gene expression
  microarray and comparative genome hybridization CGH studies performed to date on
  these tumours, including our own data. Data of whole genome microarray studies from
  altogether 164 tumours 97 benign, 67 malignant and 18 normal tissues were reclassified
  and reanalysed. Significant gene sets and cytogenetic changes from publications
  without available genomic data were also examined including 269 benign, 215 malignant
  tumour and 30 normal tissues. In our experimental study, 11 tumour and four normal
  samples were analysed by parallel mRNA and CGH profiling. Data were examined by
  an integrative bioinformatics approach GeneSpring, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares searching for common gene expression changes
  and paralleling chromosome aberrations. Both meta-analysis of available mRNA and
  CGH profiling data and our experimental study revealed three major pathogenetic
  pathways: 1 cell cycle, 2 retinoic acid signalling including lipopolysaccharide
  Toll like receptor 4 pathway , 3 complement system and antigen presentation. These
  pathways include novel, previously undescribed pathomechanisms of adrenocortical
  tumours, and associated gene products may serve as diagnostic markers of malignancy
  and therapeutic targets.'
