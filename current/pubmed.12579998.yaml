abstract: Occasionally hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs occur synchronously with or
  within focal nodular hyperplasias FNHs , raising the question of a putative causal
  relationship. In the present study, we used comparative genomic hybridization to
  investigate the occurrence of genomic aberrations in FNHs, which might lead to hepatocarcinogenesis.
  Tissue samples from FNHs and nonlesional liver tissue were obtained from 7 women.
  None of the patients had a chronic diffuse liver disease. A synchronous HCC not
  spatially related to FNH was present in 1 patient. Two patients had received oral
  contraceptives. Genomic aberrations were found in only 1 FNH. No aberration was
  found in the FNH occurring synchronously with HCC, but the HCC included gains at
  chromosomes 1q, 5, 12, and 19q and losses at 4p, 7q22-q35, 9p, 17p, 21q, and 22q.
  No aberrations were found in nonneoplastic liver tissues. Our findings support the
  notion that FNH is not a preneoplastic lesion for the occurrence of HCC in humans
  and that the synchronous occurrence of FNH and HCC is coincidental in our case.
