abstract: Cancer is a genetic disease with frequent somatic DNA alterations. Studying
  recurrent copy number aberrations (CNAs) in human cancers would enable the elucidation
  of disease mechanisms and the prioritization of candidate oncogenic drivers with
  causal roles in oncogenesis. We have comprehensively and systematically characterized
  CNAs and the accompanying gene expression changes in tumors and matched nontumor
  liver tissues from 286 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our analysis identified
  29 recurrently amplified and 22 recurrently deleted regions with a high level of
  copy number changes. These regions harbor established oncogenes and tumor suppressors,
  including CCND1 (cyclin D1), MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor 2A) and CDKN2B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B), as well
  as many other genes not previously reported to be involved in liver carcinogenesis.
  Pathway analysis of cis-acting genes in the amplification and deletion peaks implicates
  alterations of core cancer pathways, including cell-cycle, p53 signaling, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, Wnt signaling, and
  transforming growth factor beta signaling, in a large proportion of HCC patients.
  We further credentialed two candidate driver genes (BCL9 and MTDH) from the recurrent
  focal amplification peaks and showed that they play a significant role in HCC growth
  and survival.We have demonstrated that characterizing the CNA landscape in HCC will
  facilitate the understanding of disease mechanisms and the identification of oncogenic
  drivers that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this
  devastating disease.
