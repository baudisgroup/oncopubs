abstract: Genetic alterations are assumed to be necessary for the development and
  progression of ovarian cancer. However, the genetic alterations that occur during
  lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination are poorly understood. In the
  present study, we used comparative genomic hybridization to detect genetic alterations
  in 30 tumors from patients with primary ovarian cancers and analyzed the associations
  of these genetic alterations with clinical stage and surgical pathological factors,
  such as histological grade, lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination.
  The total number of genetic alterations per tumor ranged from 0 to 39, with an average
  of 17.7 alterations per tumor. Among the genetic alterations in ovarian cancers,
  gains on chromosomes 8q and 3q and losses on chromosomes 17p, 18q, and 4q were observed
  frequently. Although the difference in total numbers of genetic alterations between
  early-stage tumors and advanced-stage tumors was not significant, the difference
  was significant when high-grade cancers were compared with low-grade cancers. Eight
  regions on seven chromosomes showed genetic alterations related to lymph node metastasis
  or peritoneal dissemination. Gain at 11q13-q14 and loss at 17q11.2-q21 were related
  not only to lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination but also to clinical
  stage and histological grade.
