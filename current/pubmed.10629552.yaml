abstract: Invasive breast cancer shows a wide range of morphological differentiation,
  associated with differences in prognosis, but as yet, the underlying genetic mechanisms
  cannot be accounted for. In order to establish a model of the possible progression
  from the different subtypes of ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS to invasive breast
  cancer, 77 selected cases of invasive breast cancer representing distinct morphological
  subtypes were investigated by means of comparative genomic hybridization CGH . There
  was a high degree of genetic homology between tubular and tubulo-lobular carcinoma
  and well-differentiated DCIS, and between ductal invasive carcinoma G3 and poorly
  differentiated DCIS. Highly differentiated invasive breast cancers were characterized
  by a loss of 16q and a low average number of aberrations per case. In high-grade
  tumours, losses of this chromosomal region were seen with a much lower frequency
  in cases with evidence of an aneuploid tumour status. These data demonstrate the
  close genetic similarity of well-, intermediately, and poorly differentiated DCIS
  and distinct morphological types of invasive breast carcinoma, providing further
  evidence that DCIS is a direct precursor lesion of invasive breast cancer and that
  various evolutionary genetic pathways exist.
