abstract: Germ cell tumors GCTs are the most common solid malignancy in young adult
  men, but the genes and genomic regions involved in their etiology are not fully
  defined. We report here an investigation of DNA copy number changes in GCTs using
  1 Mb BAC arrays. As expected, 12p gain was the defining genomic alteration, occurring
  in 72 74 GCTs. Parallel expression profiling of these tumors identified potential
  oncogenes from gained regions LYN and RAB25 and potential tumor suppressor genes
  in regions of loss SYNPO2, TTC12, IGSF4, and EPB41L3 . Notably, we observed specific
  genomic alterations associated with histology, including gain of 17p11.2-q21.32
  and loss of 2p25.3 in embryonal carcinoma, gain of 8p23.3-12 and loss of 5p15.33-35.3,
  11q23.1-25, and 13q12.11-34 in seminoma, and gain of 1q31.3-42.3, 3p, 14q11.2-32.33,
  and 20q and loss of 8q11.1-23.1 in yolk sac tumors YST . Many significant genes
  that mapped to these regions had previously been associated with specific histologies,
  such as EOMES chr3 and BMP2 chr20 in YST and SPRY2 chr13 and SOX17 chr8 in seminomas.
  Additionally, our results suggest a model in which histologic differentiation of
  GCTs may drive genomic evolution.
