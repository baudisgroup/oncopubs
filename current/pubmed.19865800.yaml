abstract: Ependymomas are glial neoplasms originating from the wall of the ventricles
  or from the spinal canal. The significance of histopathological features in accurately
  predicting biological behavior is still debated. Moreover, key molecular events
  in the pathogenesis of ependymoma are yet to be defined. The main objective of the
  present study was to identify specific patterns of chromosomal aberrations that
  correlate with tumor location, histological subtype and grade. Forty-five ependymoma
  samples were analyzed by 1-megabase resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Association between clinical or histopathological parameters and the genomic
  alterations identified was evaluated. The most frequently detected chromosome chr
  abnormalities were gain of chr 7, 9, 12 and 15 and loss of chr 22. Co-occurrence
  of those five alterations characterized spinal ependymomas P 0.01 . Myxopapillary
  ependymomas displayed a specific genomic profile defined by concurrent gain of chr
  5, 7, 9, 16 and 18 P 0.0007 . Overall, the number of chromosomal abnormalities detected
  was inversely correlated with the malignancy grade. Gain of chr 1q correlated with
  intracranial high-grade tumors P 0.002 . Loss of chr 6q was mainly observed in infratentorial
  P 0.02 and World Health Organization WHO grade III P 0.04 lesions. Chr 10q loss
  was associated with high-grade ependymomas P 0.01 . The 7 9 12 15 -22 genomic profile
  is significantly associated with WHO grade II spinal ependymomas, whereas the 5
  7 9 16 18 genomic pattern is specific of myxopapillary ependymomas. Identification
  of specific genomic imbalances at a given tumor location suggests that ependymomas
  from different central nervous system CNS regions represent genetically distinct
  diseases. Detecting genomic alterations associated with aggressive biological behavior
  may help stratify patients in high- and low-risk disease.
