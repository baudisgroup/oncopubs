abstract: Osteosarcoma OS is characterized by an unstable karyotype which typically
  has a heterogeneous pattern of complex chromosomal abnormalities. High-resolution
  array comparative genomic hybridization CGH in combination with interphase fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH analyses provides a complete description of genomic imbalances
  together with an evaluation of the contribution of cell-to-cell variation to copy
  number changes. There have been no analyses to date documenting genomic signatures
  consistent with chromosomal instability mechanisms in OS tumors using array CGH.
  In this study, we utilized high-resolution array CGH to identify and characterize
  recurrent signatures of genomic imbalances using ten OS tumors. Comparison between
  the genomic profiles identified tumor groups with low, intermediate and high levels
  of genomic imbalance. Bands 6p22-- amp gt p21, 8q24 and 17p12-- amp gt p11.2 were
  consistently involved in high copy gain or amplification events. Since these three
  locations have been consistently associated with OS oncogenesis, FISH probes from
  each cytoband were used to derive an index of cellular heterogeneity for copy number
  within each region. OS with the highest degree of genomic imbalance also exhibited
  the most extreme cell-to-cell copy number variation. Significantly, the three OS
  with the most imbalance and genomic copy number heterogeneity also had the poorest
  response to preoperative chemotherapy. This genome wide analysis is the first utilizing
  oligonucleotide array CGH in combination with FISH analysis to derive genomic signatures
  of chromosomal instability in OS tumors by studying genomic imbalance and intercellular
  heterogeneity. This comprehensive genomic screening approach provides important
  insights concerning the mechanisms responsible for generating complex genomes. The
  resulting phenotypic diversity can generate tumors with a propensity for an aggressive
  disease course. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to OS
  tumor development could result in the identification of prognostic markers and therapeutic
  targets.
