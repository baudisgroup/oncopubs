abstract: 495 medulloblastomas MBs from 6 Pediatric Oncology Group POG protocols were
  reviewed to assess the incidence and prognostic significance of amp quot large cell
  amp quot and amp quot anaplastic amp quot variants. amp quot Large cell amp quot
  medulloblastomas LC MBs were those with focal or diffuse, large, round neoplastic
  cells with prominent nucleoli. amp quot Anaplastic amp quot MBs A MBs were those
  with nuclei that were also large but markedly atypical with coarse chromatin and
  irregular shapes. Twenty-one cases were identified in the combined LC A MB group,
  comprising about 4 of all MBs. Survival curves and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival
  probabilities were examined separately for the LC A MB and control groups. The logrank
  test for detecting poorer survival in the 21 cases was significant p amp lt 0.0001
  . Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-myc showed amplification in 4 of 11 cases
  of the LC A phenotype and 1 additional case of high level gain at 8q24 was disclosed
  by comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization confirmed
  c-myc amplification and found evidence for isochromosome 17q in 3 of 4 LC A cases
  studied successfully. One additional tumor showed high level gain restricted to
  2p13 consistent with n-myc amplification. Monosomy 22, common in atypical teratoid
  rhabdoid tumors, was not found. These results suggest that LC A MB phenotype could
  be, at least in part, a correlate of c-myc, and possibly n-myc, amplification. The
  study thus confirms original observations about the LC MB in regard to histological
  features, immunohistochemical findings, c-myc amplification, cytogenetic findings,
  and poor prognosis.
