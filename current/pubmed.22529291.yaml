abstract: The longitudinal evolution of a myeloma genome from diagnosis to plasma
  cell leukemia has not previously been reported. We used whole-genome sequencing
  WGS on 4 purified tumor samples and patient germline DNA drawn over a 5-year period
  in a t 4 14 multiple myeloma patient. Tumor samples were acquired at diagnosis,
  first relapse, second relapse, and end-stage secondary plasma cell leukemia sPCL
  . In addition to the t 4 14 , all tumor time points also shared 10 common single-nucleotide
  variants SNVs on WGS comprising shared initiating events. Interestingly, we observed
  genomic sequence variants that waxed and waned with time in progressive tumors,
  suggesting the presence of multiple independent, yet related, clones at diagnosis
  that rose and fell in dominance. Five newly acquired SNVs, including truncating
  mutations of RB1 and ZKSCAN3, were observed only in the final sPCL sample suggesting
  leukemic transformation events. This longitudinal WGS characterization of the natural
  history of a high-risk myeloma patient demonstrated tumor heterogeneity at diagnosis
  with shifting dominance of tumor clones over time and has also identified potential
  mutations contributing to myelomagenesis as well as transformation from myeloma
  to overt extramedullary disease such as sPCL.
