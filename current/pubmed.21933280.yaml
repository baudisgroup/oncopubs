abstract: Acquired trisomy 21 is one of the most common numerical abnormalities in
  acute myeloid leukemia AML , myelodysplastic syndrome MDS , myeloproliferative neoplasms
  MPN , and MDS MPN however, little is known about its pathogenic impact, accompanying
  submicroscopic changes, and its relation to other clinical features. Furthermore,
  previous studies addressing this issue have mainly focused on cases in which 21
  was part of a complex karyotype.
