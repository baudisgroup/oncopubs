abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs result from genetically altered hematopoietic
  stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage differentiation. The study
  of genomic mutations identified so far suggests that they occur after a common ancestral
  event or that different mutations result in similar MPN phenotypes. We report analysis
  of a chromosomal translocation, t 12 22 q14.3 q13.2 , in a patient with a BCR-ABL1-negative,
  JAK2V617F-positive MPN. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH array and targeted
  sequencing detected no mutation in nine genes reported to influence the JAK2V617F-driven
  MPNs MPL, LNK, CBL, TET2, EZH2, IKZF1, IDH1, IDH2, ASXL1 . Next-generation sequencing
  revealed a balanced HMGA2-EFCAB6 genomic rearrangement. The HMGA2 breakpoint leads
  to the loss of seven 3UTR binding sites for the microRNA miRNA let-7 tumor suppressor.
  The breakpoint in the EFCAB6 gene abrogates transcription of EFCAB6. Measurement
  of expression showed retention of HMGA2 transcription and no detectable EFCAB6 transcript.
  Allele burden comparison in a sample containing the translocation, showed 90 HMGA2-EFCAB6
  versus 50 JAK2V617F allele dose, suggesting HMGA2-EFCAB6 rearrangement plays a more
  ancestral role, pre-JAK2V617F, in the neoplastic process. The pathogenicity of the
  translocation may rest on collaborations among JAK2V617F-induced constitutive activation
  of JAK2, the oncogenic property of HMGA2, and disrupted pathways, such as alteration
  in DJ-1 expression, resulting from the impact of EFCAB6 abrogation.
