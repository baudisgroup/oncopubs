abstract: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is highly effective for chronic
  myeloid leukemia CML . However, some patients gradually develop resistance to imatinib,
  resulting in therapeutic failure. Metabonomic and genomic profiling of patients
  responses to drug interventions can provide novel information about the in vivo
  metabolism of low-molecular-weight compounds and extend our insight into the mechanism
  of drug resistance. Based on a multi-platform of high-throughput metabonomics, SNP
  array analysis, karyotype and mutation, the metabolic phenotypes and genomic polymorphisms
  of CML patients and their diverse responses to imatinib were characterized. The
  untreated CML patients UCML showed different metabolic patterns from those of healthy
  controls, and the discriminatory metabolites suggested the perturbed metabolism
  of the urea cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid metabolism, and amino acid turnover
  in UCML. After imatinib treatment, patients sensitive to imatinib SCML and patients
  resistant to imatinib RCML had similar metabolic phenotypes to those of healthy
  controls and UCML, respectively. SCML showed a significant metabolic response to
  imatinib, with marked restoration of the perturbed metabolism. Most of the metabolites
  characterizing CML were adjusted to normal levels, including the intermediates of
  the urea cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle TCA . In contrast, neither cytogenetic
  nor metabonomic analysis indicated any positive response to imatinib in RCML. We
  report for the first time the associated genetic and metabonomic responses of CML
  patients to imatinib and show that the perturbed in vivo metabolism of UCML is independent
  of imatinib treatment in resistant patients. Thus, metabonomics can potentially
  characterize patients sensitivity or resistance to drug intervention.
