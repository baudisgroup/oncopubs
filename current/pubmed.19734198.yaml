abstract: The tyrosine kinase TK family is an important regulator of signaling pathways
  that control a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, and a substantial
  proportion of TK genes are genetically altered in cancer. To clarify the somatic
  mutation profile of TK genes and discover potential targets for gastric cancer GC
  therapy, we undertook a systematic screening of mutations in the kinase domains
  of all human TK genes 636 exons of 90 genes in 17 GC cell lines and 52 microdissected
  primary GCs with poorly differentiated histology. We identified 26 non-synonymous
  alterations 22 genes in total that included 11 sequence alterations in cell lines
  and 15 somatic mutations in primary tumors. Recurrent mutations were found in four
  genes including a known oncogene NTRK3 , the Src kinase family LTK and CSK and a
  potential Wnt signal activator ROR2 . In addition, we analyzed copy number alterations
  of all the TK gene loci in the same cohort samples by array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis and identified 24 high-level amplifications and two homozygous
  deletions. Both sequence alteration and frequent copy number aberration were detected
  in two TK genes HCK and ERBB2 , strongly suggesting that they encode potential oncogenes
  in GC. Our focused and integrated analyses of systemic resequencing and gene copy
  number have revealed the novel onco-kinome profile of GC and pave the way to a comprehensive
  understanding of the GC genome.
