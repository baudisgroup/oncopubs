abstract: Pediatric osteosarcoma is characterized by multiple somatic chromosomal
  lesions, including structural variations SVs and copy number alterations CNAs .
  To define the landscape of somatic mutations in pediatric osteosarcoma, we performed
  whole-genome sequencing of DNA from 20 osteosarcoma tumor samples and matched normal
  tissue in a discovery cohort, as well as 14 samples in a validation cohort. Single-nucleotide
  variations SNVs exhibited a pattern of localized hypermutation called kataegis in
  50 of the tumors. We identified p53 pathway lesions in all tumors in the discovery
  cohort, nine of which were translocations in the first intron of the TP53 gene.
  Beyond TP53, the RB1, ATRX, and DLG2 genes showed recurrent somatic alterations
  in 29 -53 of the tumors. These data highlight the power of whole-genome sequencing
  for identifying recurrent somatic alterations in cancer genomes that may be missed
  using other methods.
