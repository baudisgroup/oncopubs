abstract: We have previously reported high-frequency microsatellite instability MSI-H
  and germ-line mismatch repair gene mutation in patients with unusually young onset
  of high-grade glioma. Some of these patients developed metachronous MSI-H colorectal
  cancer and conformed to the diagnosis of Turcots syndrome. Frameshift mutation of
  TGFbetaRII was present in all the colorectal carcinomas but not in brain tumours.
  We further characterized the genetic pathways of tumour evolution in these metachronous
  gliomas and colorectal carcinomas. All MSI-H glioblastomas had inactivation of both
  alleles of the p53 gene and showed over-expression of the p53 protein while none
  of the colorectal carcinomas had p53 mutation or protein over-expression. Flow cytometry
  and comparative genomic hybridization revealed that all glioblastomas were chromosomal
  unstable with aneuploid DNA content, and with a variable number of chromosomal arm
  aberrations. In contrast, the colorectal carcinomas had diploid or near-diploid
  DNA content with few chromosomal arm aberrations. The pattern of chromosomal aberrations
  in the two organs was different. Loss of 9p was consistently observed in all glioblastomas
  but not in colorectal carcinomas. Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification
  was absent in all glioblastomas and colorectal carcinomas. Our results suggest that
  both the frequency of p53 mutation and its effects differ greatly in the two organs.
  Following loss of mismatch repair function, p53 inactivation and chromosomal instability
  are not necessary for development of colorectal carcinoma, but are required for
  genesis of glioblastoma. Oncogene 2000 19, 4079 - 4083.
