abstract: Salivary gland myoepithelial tumors are relatively uncommon tumors with
  an unpredictable clinical course. More knowledge about their genetic profiles is
  necessary to identify novel predictors of disease. In this study, we subjected 27
  primary tumors 15 myoepitheliomas and 12 myoepithelial carcinomas to genome-wide
  microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH . We set out to delineate
  known chromosomal aberrations in more detail and to unravel chromosomal differences
  between benign myoepitheliomas and myoepithelial carcinomas. Patterns of DNA copy
  number aberrations were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis.
  Both benign and malignant tumors revealed a limited amount of chromosomal alterations
  median of 5 and 7.5, respectively . In both tumor groups, high frequency gains or
  20 were found mainly at loci of growth factors and growth factor receptors e.g.,
  PDGF, FGF R s, and EGFR . In myoepitheliomas, high frequency losses or 20 were detected
  at regions of proto-cadherins. Cluster analysis of the array CGH data identified
  three clusters. Differential copy numbers on chromosome arm 8q and chromosome 17
  set the clusters apart. Cluster 1 contained a mixture of the two phenotypes n 10
  , cluster 2 included mostly benign tumors n 10 , and cluster 3 only contained carcinomas
  n 7 . Supervised analysis between malignant and benign tumors revealed a 36 Mbp-region
  at 8q being more frequently gained in malignant tumors P 0.007, FDR 0.05 . This
  is the first study investigating genomic differences between benign and malignant
  myoepithelial tumors of the salivary glands at a genomic level. Both unsupervised
  and supervised analysis of the genomic profiles revealed chromosome arm 8q to be
  involved in the malignant phenotype of salivary gland myoepitheliomas.
