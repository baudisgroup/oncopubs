abstract: 'The World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment
  of Cancer has individualized three main categories among the primary cutaneous B
  cell lymphoma PCBCL : leg-type primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma PCLBCL leg
  type , primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma PCFCL , and primary cutaneous
  marginal zone lymphoma PCMZL . The genetic features of 21 PCBCL cases six PCLBCL
  leg type four PCFCL large cells, seven PCFCL small cells, and four PCMZL were investigated
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH array . Fluorescent in situ hybridization
  FISH analysis was performed to confirm CGH array data and to detect lymphoma-associated
  gene rearrangements. p14 ARF p16 INK4a CDKN2A gene quantification, methylation analysis,
  and immunohistochemical detection were also performed. CGH array showed a higher
  number of recurrent genetic imbalances in PCLBCL leg type mean 62 than in PCFCL
  large cells mean 34 . PCFCL small cells and PCMZL exhibited fewer chromosomal alterations
  mean 24 and 9 . FISH analysis provided concordant results with CGH array data in
  97 98 of 101 assays and demonstrated a t 8 14 q24 q32 in two of six PCLBCL leg type.
  Recurrent deletions in 9p21 p14 ARF p16 INK4a CDKN2A were a constant finding in
  PCLBCL leg type six of six . Conversely, PCFCL large cells exhibited recurrent 1p36
  deletions four of four without deletion in 9p21 zero of four . The diagnostic and
  prognostic impact of the p16 INK4a CDKN2A gene status in PCBCL should therefore
  be confirmed on a larger series.'
