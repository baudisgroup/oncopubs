abstract: A high percentage of uveal melanoma patients develop metastatic tumors predominantly
  in the liver. We studied the molecular profiles derived from gene expression microarrays
  and comparative genomic hybridization microarrays, to identify genes associated
  with metastasis in this aggressive cancer. We compared 28 uveal melanomas from patients
  who developed liver metastases within three years of enucleation with 35 tumors
  from patients without metastases or who developed metastases more than 3 years after
  enucleation. Protein tyrosine phosphatase type IV A member 3 PTP4A3 PRL3 , was identified
  as a strong predictor of metastasis occurrence. We demonstrated that the differential
  expression of this gene, which maps to 8q24.3, was not merely a consequence of 8q
  chromosome overrepresentation. PTP4A3 overexpression in uveal melanoma cell lines
  significantly increased cell migration and invasiveness in vivo, suggesting a direct
  role for this protein in metastasis. Our findings suggest that PTP4A3 or its cellular
  substrates could constitute attractive therapeutic targets to treat metastatic uveal
  melanomas.
