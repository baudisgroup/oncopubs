abstract: Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma includes type I cases and distinctive
  type II cases that, according to 2008 and 2010 World Health Organization descriptions,
  are T-cell receptor Î²+. Although T-cell receptor Î³Î´ enteropathy-associated T-cell
  lymphomas are reported, it is unknown if they have distinctive features and if they
  should be categorized as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma or as a mucocutaneous
  Î³Î´ T-cell lymphoma. To address these questions, the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic,
  molecular, and cytogenetic features of 5 Î³Î´-enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas
  were investigated. Only 1 patient had celiac disease and had type I enteropathy-associated
  T-cell lymphoma, and the others fulfilled the histopathologic criteria for type
  II enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. All lacked cutaneous involvement. A celiac
  disease-associated HLA type was found in the patient with CD and one of four others.
  All were T-cell receptor Î³+, T-cell receptor Î´+, Î²F1-, CD3+, CD7+, CD5-, CD4-,
  and TIA-1+ with variable staining for CD2 (3/5), CD8 (2/5), Granzyme B (1/5), and
  CD56 (4/5). Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated 9q34 gains in 4 cases,
  with 9q33-34 gains by single nucleotide polymorphism in 3 of these. Single nucleotide
  polymorphism analysis also demonstrated gains in 5q34-q35.1/5q35.1 (4/5), 8q24 (3/5),
  and in 32 other regions in 3 of 5 cases. VÎ´1 rearrangements were identified in
  4 of 4 cases with documented clonality showing the same clone in normal-appearing
  distant mucosa (3/3 tested cases). Thus, Î³Î´-enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas
  share many features with other enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and are mostly
  of type II. Their usual nonactivated cytotoxic phenotype and VÎ´1 usage are features
  unlike many other mucocutaneous Î³Î´ T-cell lymphomas but shared with hepatosplenic
  T-cell lymphoma. These findings support the conclusion that a Î³Î´ T-cell origin
  at extracutaneous sites does not define a specific entity.  Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier
