abstract: The differentiation of biologically and clinically different malignant lymphoma
  diseases or subtypes is crucial because it leads to better prognostication and therapeutic
  decision-making. Attempts have been made at subtype classification for diagnosing
  lymphomas on the basis of gene-expression profiling. Although array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH has identified a characteristic genomic alteration
  pattern for each disease entity, it has not been clear whether each patient with
  certain genomic alterations can be classified by array CGH data.
