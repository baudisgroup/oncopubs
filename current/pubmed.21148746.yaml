abstract: Even in small-sized  2 cm in greatest dimension and or pathologic stage
  I lung adenocarcinoma ADC , a considerable proportion of the patients will relapse
  within 5 years and show poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to identify
  genetic alterations that define prognosis of patients with early-stage lung ADC.
