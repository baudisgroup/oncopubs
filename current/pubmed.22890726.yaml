abstract: The response rate to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is relatively
  low 0.7 -3 , however, rapid and drastic tumor regression is occasionally observed.
  The molecular backgrounds and clinico-pathological features of these responders
  remain largely unclear. We analyzed the clinical and molecular backgrounds of 13
  responders to sorafenib with significant tumor shrinkage in a retrospective study.
  A comparative genomic hybridization analysis using one frozen HCC sample from a
  responder demonstrated that the 11q13 region, a rare amplicon in HCC including the
  loci for FGF3 and FGF4, was highly amplified. A real-time polymerase chain reaction-based
  copy number assay revealed that FGF3 FGF4 amplification was observed in three of
  the 10 HCC samples from responders in which DNA was evaluable, whereas amplification
  was not observed in 38 patients with stable or progressive disease P 0.006 . Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization analysis confirmed FGF3 amplification. In addition, the clinico-pathological
  features showed that multiple lung metastases 5 13, P 0.006 and a poorly differentiated
  histological type 5 13, P 0.13 were frequently observed in responders. A growth
  inhibitory assay showed that only one FGF3 FGF4-amplified and three FGFR2-amplified
  cancer cell lines exhibited hypersensitivity to sorafenib in vitro. Finally, an
  in vivo study revealed that treatment with a low dose of sorafenib was partially
  effective for stably and exogenously expressed FGF4 tumors, while being less effective
  in tumors expressing EGFP or FGF3.
