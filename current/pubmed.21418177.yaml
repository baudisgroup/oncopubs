abstract: To characterize diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL with chromosome 7 gains,
  we combined clinical data with genomic, RNA and miRNA profiling. Gains were associated
  with age 60 years, female gender, a trend for higher complete response rate, lower
  death rate, and better overall survival in patients treated with R-CHOP. Lesions
  were inversely associated with bone marrow involvement and number of extra-nodal
  sites. Differentially expressed transcripts were enriched of genes belonging to
  specific pathways and miRNAs targets. MIR96, MIR182, MIR589, MIR25 were shown significantly
  up-regulated in 7q DLBCL by real-time PCR.
