abstract: To evaluate the role of WWOX gene in human osteosarcoma, array comparative
  genomic hybridization on 10 frozen osteosarcoma specimens and immunohistochemical
  staining of 55 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues for WWOX was performed.
  Deletion of the WWOX gene was observed in 3 of 10 samples and the WWOX protein was
  undetectable in 34 of 55 osteosarcomas. This is the first investigation of the role
  of WWOX gene in human osteosarcoma. The WWOX gene deletion, loss of its protein
  expression, and lack of correlation of WWOX expression with patient survival suggest
  loss of WWOX expression is an early event in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and
  the phenotypic results of its deletion do not imminently result in patient death.
