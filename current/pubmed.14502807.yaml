abstract: Germline mutations of the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis
  coli FAP . APC inactivation results in dysregulation of wnt wingless signaling and
  contributes to chromosomal instability in vitro. To investigate somatic alterations
  that follow a known germline mutation and contribute to the transition from normal
  to neoplastic mucosa, we studied 10 adenomatous polyps from a 27-year-old patient
  with an APC germline mutation at codon 554. Chromosomal imbalances were analyzed
  by comparative genomic hybridization APC and K-ras were screened for somatic mutations.
  Before DNA analysis, the polyps were bisected to compare the genetic alterations
  with the corresponding immunohistologic phenotype of beta-catenin, a proto-oncogene
  product degraded by the APC tumor suppressor. Gains at chromosome 20 were the most
  frequent chromosomal alterations 6 polyps . Losses were found predominantly at chromosome
  4q 3 polyps . A K-ras mutation was seen in 1 polyp, while all polyps displayed somatic
  intragenic APC mutations. Comparative immunohistologic analysis revealed strong
  membranous staining for beta-catenin in all adenomatous polyps, but only 1 adenoma
  showed nuclear accumulation. Our results suggest chromosomal aberrations contribute
  early to the progression of adenomatous polyps after biallelic APC inactivation.
  APC inactivation itself is insufficient for immunohistochemically detectable nuclear
  translocation of beta-catenin.
