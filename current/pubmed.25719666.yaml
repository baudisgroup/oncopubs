abstract: 'Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of malignancies and a
  major health burden. We performed whole-genome sequencing and copy number variation
  (CNV) analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Chromosomal rearrangements
  leading to gene disruption were prevalent, affecting genes known to be important
  in pancreatic cancer (TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, ARID1A and ROBO2) and new candidate drivers
  of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KDM6A and PREX2). Patterns of structural variation
  (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4 subtypes with potential
  clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable, locally rearranged, scattered
  and unstable. A significant proportion harboured focal amplifications, many of which
  contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET, FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but
  at low individual patient prevalence. Genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation
  of DNA maintenance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2) and a mutational signature of DNA
  damage repair deficiency. Of 8 patients who received platinum therapy, 4 of 5 individuals
  with these measures of defective DNA maintenance responded.'
