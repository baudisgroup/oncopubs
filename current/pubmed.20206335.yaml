abstract: It is now understood that epigenetic alterations occur frequently in sporadic
  breast carcinogenesis, but little is known about the epigenetic alterations associated
  with familial breast tumors. We performed genome-wide DNA-methylation profiling
  on familial breast cancers n 33 to identify patterns of methylation specific to
  the different mutation groups BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAx or intrinsic subtypes of breast
  cancer basal, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-amplified, and normal-like . We used methylated
  DNA immunoprecipitation MeDIP on Affymetrix promoter chips to interrogate methylation
  profiles across 25,500 distinct transcripts. Using a support vector machine classification
  algorithm, we demonstrated that genome-wide methylation profiles predicted tumor
  mutation status with estimated error rates of 19 BRCA1 , 31 BRCA2 , and 36 BRCAx
  but did not accurately predict the intrinsic subtypes defined by gene expression.
  Furthermore, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified a distinct
  subgroup of BRCAx tumors defined by methylation profiles. We validated these findings
  in the 33 tumors in the test set, as well as in an independent validation set of
  47 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded familial breast tumors, by pyrosequencing and
  Epityper. Finally, gene-expression profiling and SNP CGH array previously performed
  on the same samples allowed full integration of methylation, gene-expression, and
  copy-number data sets, revealing frequent hypermethylation of genes that also displayed
  loss of heterozygosity, as well as of genes that show copy-number gains, providing
  a potential mechanism for expression dosage compensation. Together, these data show
  that methylation profiles for familial breast cancers are defined by the mutation
  status and are distinct from the intrinsic subtypes.
