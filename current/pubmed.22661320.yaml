abstract: Pediatric glioblastomas GBM including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas
  DIPG are devastating brain tumors with no effective therapy. Here, we investigated
  clinical and biological impacts of histone H3.3 mutations. Forty-two DIPGs were
  tested for H3.3 mutations. Wild-type versus mutated K27M-H3.3 subgroups were compared
  for HIST1H3B, IDH, ATRX and TP53 mutations, copy number alterations and clinical
  outcome. K27M-H3.3 occurred in 71 , TP53 mutations in 77 and ATRX mutations in 9
  of DIPGs. ATRX mutations were more frequent in older children p amp lt 0.0001 .
  No G34V R-H3.3, IDH1 2 or H3.1 mutations were identified. K27M-H3.3 DIPGs showed
  specific copy number changes, including all gains amplifications of PDGFRA and MYC
  PVT1 loci. Notably, all long-term survivors were H3.3 wild type and this group of
  patients had better overall survival. K27M-H3.3 mutation defines clinically and
  biologically distinct subgroups and is prevalent in DIPG, which will impact future
  therapeutic trial design. K27M- and G34V-H3.3 have location-based incidence brainstem
  cortex and potentially play distinct roles in pediatric GBM pathogenesis. K27M-H3.3
  is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type
  for H3.3 show improved survival. Based on prognostic and therapeutic implications,
  our findings argue for H3.3-mutation testing at diagnosis, which should be rapidly
  integrated into the clinical decision-making algorithm, particularly in atypical
  DIPG.
