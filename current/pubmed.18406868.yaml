abstract: The chromosomal changes in eight familial BRCAx breast cancers i.e., negative
  for BRCA1 or BRCA2 were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH to investigate
  intratumor heterogeneity. This was the first step in a study of most frequent chromosomal
  aberrations in BRCAx familial breast cancers. Laser microdissection analysis of
  paraffin tissue samples was followed by whole-genome amplification. CGH was performed
  on DNA isolated from two to three different cell groups per case to detect any cytogenetic
  aberrations in important clones that might have been missed when analyzing DNA extracted
  from large numbers of cells. The results were compared, to evaluate the influence
  of tumor heterogeneity on CGH, and the heterogeneity was confirmed comparing CGH
  with fluorescence in situ hybridization results. Different chromosomal aberrations
  were detected between adjacent clones within the same section, which highlights
  the utility of microdissection in addressing the problem of heterogeneity in whole-genome
  studies. Some chromosomal regions were more frequently altered in the eight BRCAx
  tumors loss of 2q, 3p, 3q, 8p, 9p, and 15q and gains of 1p, 4p, 4q, 5p, 6q, 12q,
  and 19p were the most common. Further studies focusing on specific genes and sequences
  with more sensitive approaches, such as array-CGH, are warranted to confirm these
  findings.
