abstract: 'Sixty-four patients with adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma ATL 18 patients
  with indolent subtype and 46 with aggressive subtype associated with human T-lymphotropic
  virus type 1 HTLV-1 were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization CGH .
  The most frequent observations were gains at chromosomes 14q, 7q, and 3p and losses
  at chromosomes 6q and 13q. Chromosome imbalances, losses, and gains were more frequently
  observed in aggressive ATL than in indolent ATL, with significant differences between
  the 2 ATL subtypes at gains of 1q and 4q. An increased number of chromosomal imbalances
  was associated with a significantly shorter survival in all patients. A high number
  of chromosomal losses was associated with a poor prognosis in indolent ATL, whereas
  the presence of 7q was marginally associated with a good prognosis in aggressive
  ATL. Paired samples ie, samples obtained at different sites from 4 patients and
  sequential samples from 13 patients from 6 during both chronic disease and acute
  crisis and from 7 during both acute onset and relapse were examined by CGH and Southern
  blotting for HTLV-1. All but 2 paired samples showed differences on CGH assessment.
  Two chronic crisis samples showed distinct results regarding both CGH and HTLV-1
  integration sites, indicating clonal changes in ATL at crisis. In 11 patients, the
  finding of identical HTLV-1 sites and clonally related CGH results suggested a common
  origin of sequential samples. In contrast to chronic crisis samples, CGH results
  with all acute relapse sample pairs showed the presence of clonally related but
  not evolutional subclones at relapse, thereby suggesting marked chromosomal instability.
  In summary, clonal diversity is common during progression of ATL, and CGH alterations
  are associated with clinical course. Blood. 2001 97:3875-3881 '
