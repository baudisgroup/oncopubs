abstract: The proportion of never smoker non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC in Asia
  is about 30-40 . Despite the striking demographics and high prevalence of never
  smoker NSCLC, the exact causes still remain undetermined. Although several genome
  wide association GWA studies were conducted to find susceptibility loci for lung
  cancer in never smokers, no regions were replicated except for 5p15.33, suggesting
  locus heterogeneity and different environmental toxic effects. To identify genetic
  loci associated with susceptibility of lung cancer in never smokers, we performed
  a GWA analysis using the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. For discovery GWA set, we recruited
  446 never smoking Korean patients with NSCLC and 497 normal subjects. We tested
  association of SNPs with lung cancer susceptibility using the Cochran-Armitage trend
  test. For validation, 39 SNPs were selected from the top 50 SNPs and five additional
  SNPs were selected in the DAB1 gene region which showed significant associations
  in the GWA analysis. The validation SNPs were genotyped in an independent sample
  including 434 patients and 1,000 controls. Among the 44 validation SNPs, two SNPs
  rs11080466 and rs11663246 near the APCDD1, NAPG and FAM38B genes in the 18p11.22
  region were replicated. P value of rs11080466 was 1.08 10 -6 in the combined sets
  2.68 10 -5 in the discovery set and 2.60 10 -3 in the validation set and odds ratio
  was 0.68 0.58-0.79 . We observed similar association for rs11663246. Our result
  suggests the 18p11.22 region as a novel lung cancer susceptibility locus in never
  smokers.
