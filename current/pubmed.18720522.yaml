abstract: A study was undertaken to correlate telomere dysfunction and genomic instability
  with the histopathological grades and the estrogen and progesterone receptor status
  in breast cancer. Sixty-one archived breast tissues 38 cancer tissues and 23 paired
  normal tissues were used in the study. The breast tumor tissues showed significantly
  shorter telomeres 7.7 kb compared with the paired adjacent tissues 9.0 kb by Southern
  blot analysis. Moreover, telomere shortening was more significant in Grade III tumors
  than in the Grade II tumors P 0.05 . Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization
  on paraffin tissue sections revealed a similar trend in telomere shortening. Telomere
  attrition was associated with telomere dysfunction as revealed by the presence of
  significantly higher anaphase bridges in tumor cells which was tumor grade dependent.
  Furthermore, estrogen receptive negative tumors displayed higher anaphase and internuclear
  bridges. Selected samples from each grade showed greater genomic imbalances in the
  higher grades than the lower grade tumors as detected by array-comparative genomic
  hybridization. Telomerase activity was found to be higher in the higher grades Grade
  II and III compared with the lower grade Grade I . The average mRNA expression of
  TRF1 and POT1 was lower in the tumor tissues than in the normal tissues. Tankyrase
  1 mRNA expression showed a grade-dependent increase in tumor tissues and its expression
  was also high in estrogen and progesterone negative tumors. The data support the
  notion that telomere dysfunction might be of value as a marker of aggressiveness
  of the tumors in breast cancer patients.
