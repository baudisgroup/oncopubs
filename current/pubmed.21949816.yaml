abstract: Near-haploid chromosome numbers have been found in less than 1 of cytogenetically
  reported tumors, but seem to be more common in certain neoplasms including the malignant
  cartilage-producing tumor chondrosarcoma. By a literature survey of published karyotypes
  from chondrosarcomas we could confirm that loss of chromosomes resulting in hyperhaploid-hypodiploid
  cells is common and that these cells may polyploidize. Sixteen chondrosarcomas were
  investigated by single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array and the majority displayed
  SNP patterns indicative of a hyperhaploid-hypodiploid origin, with or without subsequent
  polyploidization. Except for chromosomes 5, 7, 19, 20 and 21, autosomal loss of
  heterozygosity was commonly found, resulting from chromosome loss and subsequent
  duplication of monosomic chromosomes giving rise to uniparental disomy. Additional
  gains, losses and rearrangements of genetic material, and even repeated rounds of
  polyploidization, may affect chondrosarcoma cells resulting in highly complex karyotypes.
  Loss of chromosomes and subsequent polyploidization was not restricted to a particular
  chondrosarcoma subtype and, although commonly found in chondrosarcoma, binucleated
  cells did not seem to be involved in these events.
