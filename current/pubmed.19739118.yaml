abstract: This study focused on a cell cycle regulatory gene, FBXW7, which ubiquitinates
  c-Myc and cyclin E and promotes exit from the cell cycle. We determined the expression
  level of FBXW7 in colorectal cancer CRC cases, correlated those values with clinicopathologic
  features, and characterized the molecular mechanism of reduced expression of FBXW7
  in CRC cells in vitro. FBXW7 mRNA and protein expression were evaluated in 93 CRC
  cases. Using CGH array, the copy number aberrations of the flanking region of FBXW7
  were evaluated in another 130 CRC specimens. In vitro analysis of FBXW7 gene silencing
  in CRC cells was conducted. FBXW7 mRNA expression was significantly lower in tumor
  tissues than the corresponding normal tissues. The low FBXW7 expression group showed
  a significantly poorer prognosis than patients in the high expression group. A concordant
  relationship was observed between the incidence of FBXW7 repression and the genetic
  alteration. The incidence of genetic alteration was associated with the stage of
  disease progression. In vitro, FBXW7-specific siRNA enhanced expression of c-MYC
  and cyclin E proteins and up-regulated cell proliferation. Genetic alterations in
  tumors led to the loss of FBXW7 expression and increased cell proliferation. FBXW7
  expression provides a prognostic factor for patients with CRC.
