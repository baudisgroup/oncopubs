abstract: Sezary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukaemic variant of cutaneous T-cell
  lymphoma. Recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been found in SS, but the whole
  genetic mutation spectrum is unknown. To better understand the molecular pathogenesis
  of SS, we performed exome sequencing, copy number variation (CNV) and gene expression
  analysis of primary SS cells. In our index patient with typical SS, we found novel
  somatic missense mutations in TBL1XR1, EPHA7 and SLFN12 genes in addition to larger
  chromosomal changes. The mutations are located in biologically relevant genes affecting
  apoptosis and T-cell maturation. They may play a role in the pathobiology of the
  disease, but no recurrent mutations were discovered in nine additional patients
  with SS studied. Thus, screening of larger patient cohorts is needed to confirm
  their prevalence and biological significance in SS.  ï¿½ 2014 John Wiley & Sons
