abstract: 'Screening for gene copy-number alterations CNAs has improved by applying
  genome-wide microarrays, where SNP arrays also allow analysis of loss of heterozygozity
  LOH . We here analyzed 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL samples using four different
  high-resolution platforms: BAC arrays 32K , oligonucleotide arrays 185K, Agilent
  , and two SNP arrays 250K, Affymetrix and 317K, Illumina . Cross-platform comparison
  revealed 29 concordantly detected CNAs, including known recurrent alterations, which
  confirmed that all platforms are powerful tools when screening for large aberrations.
  However, detection of 32 additional regions present in 2-3 platforms illustrated
  a discrepancy in detection of small CNAs, which often involved reported copy-number
  variations. LOH analysis using dChip revealed concordance of mainly large regions,
  but showed numerous, small nonoverlapping regions and LOH escaping detection. Evaluation
  of baseline variation and copy-number ratio response showed the best performance
  for the Agilent platform and confirmed the robustness of BAC arrays. Accordingly,
  these platforms demonstrated a higher degree of platform-specific CNAs. The SNP
  arrays displayed higher technical variation, although this was compensated by high
  density of elements. Affymetrix detected a higher degree of CNAs compared to Illumina,
  while the latter showed a lower noise level and higher detection rate in the LOH
  analysis. Large-scale studies of genomic aberrations are now feasible, but new tools
  for LOH analysis are requested.'
