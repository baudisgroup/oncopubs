abstract: Histologically it is nearly impossible to distinguish the dedifferentiated
  component of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma from undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
  of bone when the low-grade cartilaginous component is absent. Previous studies have
  revealed that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutations are present in
  a significant number of cartilaginous tumors including the majority of conventional
  chondrosarcoma and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. These mutations have not been
  studied in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas of bone. We sought to investigate
  whether an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation signature could be used as a clinically diagnostic
  marker for the distinction of dedifferentiated component of chondrosarcoma from
  undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of bone. Sixty-eight bone tumor cases, including
  31 conventional chondrosarcomas, 23 dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, and 14 undifferentiated
  pleomorphic sarcomas of bone, were collected for IDH1/2 mutation analysis either
  using the Qiagen IDH1/2 RGQ PCR Kit or using whole exome sequencing. IDH1/2 mutations
  were detected in 87% (20/23) of dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas and 30% (6/20)
  of conventional chondrosarcomas. No mutations were detected in the IDH1/2 codon
  132 or codon 172 among 14 UPS of bone. Identification of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations
  supports the diagnosis of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma rather than undifferentiated
  pleomorphic sarcoma of bone while also providing some insight into the pathogenesis
  of these two lesions.
