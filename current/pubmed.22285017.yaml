abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL is a clinically heterogeneous disease.
  The methods currently used for monitoring CLL and determining conditions for treatment
  are limited in their ability to predict disease progression, patient survival, and
  response to therapy. Although clonal diversity and the acquisition of new chromosomal
  abnormalities during the disease course clonal evolution have been associated with
  disease progression, their prognostic potential has been underappreciated because
  cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH studies have a restricted
  ability to detect genomic abnormalities and clonal evolution. We hypothesized that
  whole genome analysis using high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism SNP microarrays
  would be useful to detect diversity and infer clonal evolution to offer prognostic
  information. In this study, we used the Infinium Omni1 BeadChip Illumina, San Diego,
  CA array for the analysis of genetic variation and percent mosaicism in 25 non-selected
  CLL patients to explore the prognostic value of the assessment of clonal diversity
  in patients with CLL. We calculated the percentage of mosaicism for each abnormality
  by applying a mathematical algorithm to the genotype frequency data and by manual
  determination using the Simulated DNA Copy Number SiDCoN tool, which was developed
  from a computer model of mosaicism. At least one genetic abnormality was identified
  in each case, and the SNP data was 98 concordant with FISH results. Clonal diversity,
  defined as the presence of two or more genetic abnormalities with differing percentages
  of mosaicism, was observed in 12 patients 48 , and the diversity correlated with
  the disease stage. Clonal diversity was present in most cases of advanced disease
  Rai stages III and IV or those with previous treatment, whereas 9 of 13 patients
  without detected clonal diversity were asymptomatic or clinically stable. In conclusion,
  SNP microarray studies with simultaneous evaluation of genomic alterations and mosaic
  distribution of clones can be used to assess apparent clonal evolution via analysis
  of clonal diversity. Since clonal evolution in CLL is strongly correlated with disease
  progression, whole genome SNP microarray analysis provides a new comprehensive and
  reliable prognostic tool for CLL patients.
