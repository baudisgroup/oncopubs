abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal
  malignant tumors in Southeast Asia. Thirty-one cirrhotic HCC, 14 noncirrhotic HCC,
  and 13 metastastic HCC in the Korean population were investigated on microdissected
  tissues for chromosomal aberrations by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase
  chain reaction PCR comparative genomic hybridization. A number of prominent sites
  of genomic imbalances were observed. The gains of 1q, 6p, 7, 8q, 12q, 13q3-q32,
  16p, 17q, and 20q and the losses of 1p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 13q regions were observed
  with a similar high frequency in all types. Various chromosomal aberrations were
  observed preferentially to specific types. Gains of 4p15-pter, 10q24-qter, 18p11-pter,
  and 19p10-pter and a loss of 11q14-q22 were observed in the cirrhotic HCC, whereas
  losses of 14q21-q23 and 10q22-q23 were observed in noncirrhotic HCC. In metastatic
  HCC, gains of 3q25-qter and Xp21-pter and losses of 21q11-qter and Y were observed.
  The recurrent gains and losses of chromosomal regions identified in this study are
  consistent with several previous observations and provide possible candidate regions
  for the involvement of tumorigenesis and progressions of HCC.
