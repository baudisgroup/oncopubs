abstract: 'Gene-expression profiling has identified 3 major subgroups of diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma DLBCL : germinal center B-cell-like GCB , activated B-cell-like
  ABC , and primary mediastinal DLBCL PMBCL . Using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , we investigated the genetic alterations of 224 cases of untreated DLBCL 87
  GCB-DLBCL, 77 ABC-DLBCL, 19 PMBCL, and 41 unclassified DLBCL previously characterized
  by gene-expression profiling. The DLBCL subgroups differed significantly in the
  frequency of particular chromosomal aberrations. ABC-DLBCL had frequent trisomy
  3, gains of 3q and 18q21-q22, and losses of 6q21-q22, whereas GCB-DLBCL had frequent
  gains of 12q12, and PMBCL had gains of 9p21-pter and 2p14-p16. Parallel analysis
  of CGH alterations, locus-specific gene-expression profiles, and global gene-expression
  signatures revealed that DNA amplifications and gains had a substantial impact on
  the expression of genes in the involved chromosomal regions, and some genes were
  overexpressed in a DLBCL subgroup-specific fashion. Unexpectedly, specific chromosomal
  alterations were associated with significant changes in gene-expression signatures
  that reflect various aspects of lymphoma cell biology as well as the host response
  to the lymphoma. In addition, gains involving the chromosomal region 3p11-p12 provided
  prognostic information that was statistically independent of the previously defined
  gene-expression-based survival model, thereby improving its predictive power.'
