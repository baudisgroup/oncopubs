abstract: Ileal carcinoids are malignant neuroendocrine tumours of the small intestine.
  The aim of this study was to obtain a high-resolution genomic profile of ileal carcinoids
  in order to define genetic changes important for tumour initiation, progression
  and survival. Forty-three patients with ileal carcinoids were investigated by high-resolution
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization. The average number of copy number
  alterations CNAs per tumour was 7.1 range 1-22 , with losses being more common than
  gains ratio 1.4 . The most frequent CNA was loss of chromosome 18 74 . Other frequent
  CNAs were gain of chromosome 4, 5, 14 and 20, and loss of 11q22.1-q22.2, 11q22.3-q23.1
  and 11q23.3, and loss of 16q12.2-q22.1 and 16q23.2-qter. Two distinct patterns of
  CNAs were found the majority of tumours was characterized by loss of chromosome
  18 while a subgroup of tumours had intact chromosome 18, but gain of chromosome
  14. Survival analysis, using a series of Poisson regressions including recurrent
  CNAs, demonstrated that gain of chromosome 14 was a strong predictor of poor survival.
  In conclusion, high-resolution profiling demonstrated two separate patterns of CNAs
  in ileal carcinoids. The majority of tumours showed loss of chromosome 18, which
  most likely represents a primary event in the development and pathogenesis of tumours.
  A different genetic pathway is operative in a subgroup of tumours this is characterized
  by gain of chromosome 14 and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. Predictive
  fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of chromosome 14 status in patients
  with ileal carcinoids is suggested.
