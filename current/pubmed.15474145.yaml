abstract: Prostate cancer remains the most common male malignancy in Western countries,
  yet limited information exists regarding genetic changes and clinical correlations.
  The advent of comparative genomic hybridization microarray GM technology has recently
  allowed for precise screening of DNAs for genetic copy number changes this offers
  an advantage over previous techniques, including conventional cytogenetics. A problem
  with cytogenetic prostate cancer analysis has been the study of the appropriate
  cell types because this is a highly heterogeneous tumor. We have performed GM using
  the Spectral Genomics Inc. dye reversal platform on 20 primary prostate tumors.
  These tumor samples were from frozen tissue collected over the last 10 years and
  multiple clinical parameters, including follow-up were collected on these patients
  cytogenetic analysis was previously attempted on all patients. Eighty percent 16
  20 of specimens showed copy number changes, 65 of which were losses and 35 were
  gains of genetic material. The most common changes observed were loss of an interstitial
  region of 2q 8 cases, 40 , followed by loss of interstitial 6q 6 cases, 30 , loss
  at 8p and 13q 5 cases each, 25 , gain at 3p and loss at 5q, 16q, and Xq 4 cases
  each, 20 , and gain at 8p 3 cases, 15 . There was evidence of correlation of loss
  at 5q with a positive node status. Cytogenetic studies on these same patients only
  detected clonal changes in 40 8 20 specimens and did not detect the majority of
  abnormalities seen by the GM technique. We propose this technology for the evaluation
  of prostate and other heterogeneous cancers as a rapid and efficient way to detect
  genetic copy number changes.
