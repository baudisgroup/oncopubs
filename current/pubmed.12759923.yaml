abstract: 'We report the use of spectral karyotyping SKY and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to describe the numerous genomic imbalances characteristic of stage IV clear
  cell renal cell carcinoma CCRCC . SKY and CGH were performed on 10 cell lines established
  from nephrectomy specimens, and CGH on uncultured material from five of the primary
  renal tumors. The mutational status of VHL 3p25 and MET 7q31 , genes implicated
  in renal carcinogenesis, were determined for each case. Each case showed marked
  aneuploidy, with an average number of copy alterations of 14.6 -2.7 in the primary
  tumors and 19.3 -4.6 in the cell lines. Both whole-chromosome and chromosome-segment
  imbalances were noted by CGH: consistent losses or gains included 5q23-- amp gt
  ter 100 , -3p14-- amp gt ter 80 , and 7 70 . All VHL mutations and 83 of the genomic
  imbalances found in the primary tumors were also found in the cell lines derived
  from them. SKY showed many complex structural rearrangements that were undetected
  by conventional banding analysis in these solid tumors. All cases with VHL inactivation
  had 3p loss and 5q gain related primarily to unbalanced translocations between 3p
  and 5q. In contrast, gains of chromosome 7 resulted primarily from whole-chromosome
  gains and were not associated with mutations of MET. SKY and CGH demonstrated that
  genomic imbalances in advanced RCC were the result of either segregation errors
  i.e., whole chromosomal gains and losses 7.8 case or chromosomal rearrangements
  10.7 case , of which the majority were unbalanced translocations.'
