abstract: Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer a high risk of breast and ovarian
  cancer but the incomplete penetrance of these mutations suggests that other genetic
  and or environmental factors may modify this risk. We present a family where all
  affected members carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the index case had suffered
  from cancer twice in the last 27 years, whereas her monozygotic twin sister, also
  a carrier of the mutation, remained healthy. As copy number variants CNVs contribute
  to phenotypic diversity, a comparative genomic hybridization array CGH was performed
  to see whether the differences in the CNV profile were a modifier factor of the
  phenotype in our monozygotic twins. Our results show that differences in the CNVs
  profile were not the cause of the extremely variable penetrance observed in our
  MZ twin. The search for an explanation should not therefore be limited to genetic
  changes at the level of the DNA sequence.
