abstract: Breast cancer brain metastases remain a significant clinical problem. Chemotherapy
  is ineffective and a lack of treatment options result in poor patient outcomes.
  Targeted therapeutics have proven to be highly effective in primary breast cancer,
  but lack of molecular genomic characterization of metastatic brain tumors is hindering
  the development of new treatment regimens. Here we contribute to fill this void
  by reporting on gene copy number variation (CNV) in 10 breast cancer metastatic
  brain tumors, assayed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Results
  were compared to a list of cancer genes verified by others to influence cancer.
  Cancer gene aberrations were identified in all specimens and pathway-level analysis
  was applied to aggregate data, which identified stem cell pluripotency pathway enrichment
  and highlighted recurring, significant amplification of SOX2, PIK3CA, NTRK1, GNAS,
  CTNNB1, and FGFR1. For a subset of the metastatic brain tumor samples (n = 4) we
  compared patient-matched primary breast cancer specimens. The results of our CGH
  analysis and validation by alternative methods indicate that oncogenic signals driving
  growth of metastatic tumors exist in the original cancer. This report contributes
  support for more rapid development of new treatments of metastatic brain tumors,
  the use of genomic-based diagnostic tools and repurposed drug treatments.
