abstract: 'Metastases account for approximately 50 of the malignant tumors in the
  brain. In order to identify structural alterations that are associated with tumor
  dissemination into the central nervous system we used Comparative Genomic Hybridization
  CGH to investigate 42 brain metastases and 3 primary tumors of 40 patients. The
  metastases originated from lung cancer 14 cases , melanomas 7 , carcinomas of breast
  5 , colon 5 , kidney 5 , adrenal gland 1 and thyroid 1 . In addition, tumors of
  initially unknown primaries were assessed in 3 cases. The highest incidence of DNA
  gains were observed for the chromosomal regions 1q23, 8q24, 17q24-q25, 20q13 amp
  gt 80 of cases followed by the gain on 7p12 77 . DNA losses were slightly less frequent
  with 4q22, 4q26, 5q21, 9p21 being affected in at least 70 of the cases followed
  by deletions at 17p12, 4q32q34, 10q21, 10q23-q24 and 18q21-q22 in 67.5 of cases.
  Two unusual narrow regional peaks were observed for the gain on 17q24-q25 and loss
  on 17p12. The incidence at individual loci can be viewed at our CGH online tumor
  database at http: amba.charite.de cgh . The metastases of each tumor type showed
  a recurrent pattern of changes. In those cases with primary tumor and metastases
  available, the CGH pattern exhibited a high degree of conformity. In conclusion,
  our data suggests that specific genetic lesions are associated with tumor dissemination
  into the nervous system and that CGH analysis may be a useful supplementary tool
  for classification of metastases with unknown origin.'
