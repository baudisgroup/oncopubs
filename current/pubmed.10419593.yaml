abstract: Oesophageal adenocarcinomas arising in Barretts epithelium occasionally
  present as multiple lesions. This could be due to either a multifocal presentation
  of the same tumour, or different neoplasms arising simultaneously in a dysplastic
  Barretts oesophagus field cancerization . This is a report of the genetic analysis
  of multiple neoplastic sites in a Barretts oesophagus with an extensive area of
  dysplasia. In addition, the dysplastic Barretts epithelium was evaluated. For the
  genetic screening, comparative genomic hybridization CGH allowed evaluation of the
  whole genome of each specimen. Five cancerous regions were selected and subsequently
  dissected from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. The use of archival materials enabled
  a targeted collection of representative tumour locations. Multiple genetic aberrations
  were detected by CGH in all cancer sites. Losses on 3p, 4, 7q, 18q, and Y, as well
  as gains on 8q, 9q, 12p, 13q, 17q, 20p and X, were found in each specimen. In four
  out of the five lesions, simultaneous losses on 9p, 15q, and 16q, with concomitant
  gains on 5p, 7q, and 10p, were disclosed by CGH. Adjacent high-grade dysplastic
  Barretts mucosa shared the losses on 3p, 4, 7q, 9p, 18, and Y, as well as the gains
  on 5p, 7q, 13q, 17q, and X, thereby confirming its precursor status. Within this
  single and rare case of multifocal Barretts adenocarcinoma, a monoclonal genotype
  was present. This must have been caused by an extensive outgrowth of a single tumour.
