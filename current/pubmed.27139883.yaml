abstract: Intratumoral heterogeneity hampers the success of marker-based anticancer
  treatment because the targeted therapy may eliminate a specific subpopulation of
  tumor cells while leaving others unharmed. Accordingly, a rational strategy minimizing
  survival of the drug-resistant subpopulation is essential to achieve long-term therapeutic
  efficacy.Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the intratumoral
  heterogeneity of a pair of primary renal cell carcinoma and its lung metastasis.
  Activation of drug target pathways demonstrates considerable variability between
  the primary and metastatic sites, as well as among individual cancer cells within
  each site. Based on the prediction of multiple drug target pathway activation, we
  derive a combinatorial regimen co-targeting two mutually exclusive pathways for
  the metastatic cancer cells. This combinatorial strategy shows significant increase
  in the treatment efficacy over monotherapy in the experimental validation using
  patient-derived xenograft platforms in vitro and in vivo.Our findings demonstrate
  the investigational application of single-cell RNA-seq in the design of an anticancer
  regimen. The approach may overcome intratumoral heterogeneity which hampers the
  success of precision medicine.
