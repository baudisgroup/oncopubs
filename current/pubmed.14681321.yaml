abstract: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma SMZL is a rare non-Hodgkins lymphoma that
  recently has been recognized as an entity. The first goal of this study was to identify
  potential chromosomal aberrations in this entity by cytogenetic analysis and comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . The second goal was to assess the frequency of 7q31-32
  allelic imbalances in SMZL with primary involvement of the spleen and the typical
  immunophenotype IgM IgD dim and CD5-, CD10-, and CD23- . We applied CGH and cytogenetics
  to 13 cases of SMZL with primary splenic involvement. By CGH, we found DNA copy
  number changes in 11 of 13 cases. Overall chromosomal gains were more frequent than
  chromosomal losses. Gains were most frequently detected for chromosome X, chromosome
  3, and chromosome 18. Losses commonly involved chromosome 7 and chromosome 6.CGH
  and cytogenetic analysis showed a deletion in chromosome 7q31 in 4 cases. Loss of
  heterozygosity LOH analysis using three microsatellite markers located at 7q31 revealed
  LOH in 9 cases. Remarkably, 2 of the 4 cases that lacked a 7q31 deletion had an
  atypical immunophenotype because they were partially CD23 positive. The other 2
  cases were not informative. The findings indicate that SMZL with primary splenic
  presentation and the typical IgM , IgDdim, CD5-, CD10-, CD23- immunophenotype is
  characterized by the presence of deletions in chromosome 7q31-32.
