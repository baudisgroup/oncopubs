abstract: We have performed comparative genomic hybridization on 12 testicular germ
  cell tumor TGCT cell lines and one paraffin-embedded surgical specimen to identify
  and characterize genome-wide gains and losses of chromosomes in these specimens.
  All specimens demonstrated overrepresentation of 12p. Other significant chromosomal
  gains, apart from 12p, included the X chromosome and chromosome arms 1q and 20q.
  Chromosomal losses were observed for chromosomes 4 and 18 and chromosome arms 2q,
  9q, and 13q. Genomic differences were observed between an embryonal carcinoma component
  of a mixed tumor, 833K, and its cisplastin-resistant derivative line, 64CP, including
  losses of 6q23 approximately qter and 9p22 approximately q21. Five lines also demonstrated
  gain of 12p and additional 12p12 approximately p13 material. Similarly, two lines
  demonstrated gain of 12p and additional 12p11.2 approximately p12 material. The
  data supports the consistent gain of 12p in adult TGCT cell lines and additional
  regional amplification of 12p in some lines. This regional amplification has been
  observed in both primary tumor specimens and TGCT cell lines and may support a hypothesis
  that at least two different regions of 12p, one proximal and one distal, harbor
  genes important for the pathogenesis of testicular germ cell neoplasia.
