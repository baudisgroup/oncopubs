abstract: Systematic analyses of cancer genomes promise to unveil patterns of genetic
  alterations linked to the genesis and spread of human cancers. High-density single-nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP arrays enable detailed and genome-wide identification of both loss-of-heterozygosity
  events and copy-number alterations in cancer. Here, by integrating SNP array-based
  genetic maps with gene expression signatures derived from NCI60 cell lines, we identified
  the melanocyte master regulator MITF microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
  as the target of a novel melanoma amplification. We found that MITF amplification
  was more prevalent in metastatic disease and correlated with decreased overall patient
  survival. BRAF mutation and p16 inactivation accompanied MITF amplification in melanoma
  cell lines. Ectopic MITF expression in conjunction with the BRAF V600E mutant transformed
  primary human melanocytes, and thus MITF can function as a melanoma oncogene. Reduction
  of MITF activity sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting
  MITF in combination with BRAF or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors may offer a
  rational therapeutic avenue into melanoma, a highly chemotherapy-resistant neoplasm.
  Together, these data suggest that MITF represents a distinct class of lineage survival
  or lineage addiction oncogenes required for both tissue-specific cancer development
  and tumour progression.
