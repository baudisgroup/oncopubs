abstract: Polycythemia vera PV and essential thrombocytosis ET are clonal chronic
  myeloproliferative disorders originating from a multipotent stem cell. Bone marrow
  examinations reveal chromosomal abnormalities in 15-43 of PV patients and 5 of ET
  patients, but no specific recurring abnormality has been found to date. We aimed
  to find cytogenetic aberrations in PV and ET by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , a relatively new molecular cytogenetic technique. In this study, CGH analysis
  was performed on peripheral blood leukocytes of 12 PV patients and 8 ET patients.
  One patient 8.3 with PV had an abnormal karyotype with a deletion in 7q11.2 and
  one patient with ET 12.5 had a gain in 18p. Peripheral blood analysis by CGH revealed
  a low frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in PV and ET patients. However, using
  CGH we were able to detect two cytogenetic aberrations that were not reported previously
  in these disorders.
