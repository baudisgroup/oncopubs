abstract: "Carcinoma of the oral tongue (OTSCC) is the most common malignancy of the
  oral cavity, characterized by frequent recurrence and poor survival. The last three
  decades has witnessed a change in the OTSCC epidemiological profile, with increasing
  incidence in younger patients, females and never-smokers. Here, we sought to characterize
  the OTSCC genomic landscape and to determine factors that may delineate the genetic
  basis of this disease, inform prognosis and identify targets for therapeutic intervention.
  \ Seventy-eight cases were subjected to whole-exome (n창\x80\x89=창\x80\x8918) and
  targeted deep sequencing (n창\x80\x89=창\x80\x8960).  While the most common mutation
  was in TP53, the OTSCC genetic landscape differed from previously described cohorts
  of patients with head and neck tumors: OTSCCs demonstrated frequent mutations in
  DST and RNF213, while alterations in CDKN2A and NOTCH1 were significantly less frequent.
  Despite a lack of previously reported NOTCH1 mutations, integrated analysis showed
  enrichments of alterations affecting Notch signaling in OTSCC. Importantly, these
  Notch pathway alterations were prognostic on multivariate analyses. A high proportion
  of OTSCCs also presented with alterations in drug targetable and chromatin remodeling
  genes. Patients harboring mutations in actionable pathways were more likely to succumb
  from recurrent disease compared with those who did not, suggesting that the former
  should be considered for treatment with targeted compounds in future trials.  Our
  study defines the Asian OTSCC mutational landscape, highlighting the key role of
  Notch signaling in oral tongue tumorigenesis. We also observed somatic mutations
  in multiple therapeutically relevant genes, which may represent candidate drug targets
  in this highly lethal tumor type."
