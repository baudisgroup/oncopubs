abstract: DNA amplifications, leading to the overexpression of oncogenes, are a cardinal
  feature of lung cancer and directly contribute to its pathogenesis. To uncover such
  novel alterations, we performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  survey of 128 non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines and tumors. Prominent among
  our findings, we identified recurrent high-level amplification at cytoband 22q11.21
  in 3 of lung cancer specimens, with another 11 of specimens exhibiting low-level
  gain spanning that locus. The 22q11.21 amplicon core contained eight named genes,
  only four of which were overexpressed by transcript profiling when amplified. Among
  these, CRKL encodes an adapter protein functioning in signal transduction, best
  known as a substrate of the BCR-ABL kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia. RNA-interference-mediated
  knockdown of CRKL in lung cancer cell lines with but not without amplification led
  to significantly decreased cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, cell survival,
  and cell motility and invasion. In addition, overexpression of CRKL in immortalized
  human bronchial epithelial cells led to enhanced growth factor-independent cell
  growth. Our findings indicate that amplification and resultant overexpression of
  CRKL contribute to diverse oncogenic phenotypes in lung cancer, with implications
  for targeted therapy, and highlight a role of adapter proteins as primary genetic
  drivers of tumorigenesis.
