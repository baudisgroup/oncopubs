abstract: Chronic myelogenous leukemia CML results from the neoplastic transformation
  of a haematopoietic stem cell. The hallmark genetic abnormality of CML is a chimeric
  BCR ABL1 fusion gene resulting from the Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement t
  9 22 q34 q11 . Clinical and laboratory studies indicate that the BCR ABL1 fusion
  protein is essential for initiation, maintenance and progression of CML, yet the
  event s driving the transformation from chronic phase to blast phase are poorly
  understood.
