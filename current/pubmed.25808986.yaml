abstract: Chromosomal instability resulting in copy number alterations is a hallmark
  of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, few studies have attempted to characterize
  the chromosomal changes occurring in early-onset CRC in order to compare them with
  those taking place within the more extensively studied late-onset CRC subset. Our
  aim was to characterize the genomic profiles of these two groups of colorectal tumors
  and to compare them to each other. Array comparative genomic hybridization profiling
  of 146 colorectal tumors (60 early-onset and 86 late-onset) in combination with
  an unsupervised analysis was used to define common and specific copy number alterations.
  We found a number of important differences between the chromosomal instability profiles
  of each age subset. Thus, losses at 1p36, 1p12, 1q21, 9p13, 14q11, 16p13, and 16p12
  were significantly more frequent in younger patients, whereas gains at 7q11 and
  7q22 were more frequent in older patients. Moreover, the unsupervised analysis stratified
  the tumors into two clusters, each one of which was enriched in patients from one
  of the age subsets. Our findings confirm the existence of substantial differences
  between the chromosomal instability profiles of the two groups which are more important
  from a qualitative point of view. Further studies are needed to understand the clinicopathological
  implications of these dissimilarities. ï¿½ 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  ï¿½ 2015
