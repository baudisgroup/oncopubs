abstract: "The return of research results (RoR) remains a complex and well-debated
  issue. Despite the debate, actual data related to the experience of giving individual
  results back, and the impact these results may have on clinical care and health
  outcomes, is sorely lacking. Through the work of the Australian Pancreatic Cancer
  Genome Initiative (APGI) we: (1) delineate the pathway back to the patient where
  actionable research data were identified; and (2) report the clinical utilisation
  of individual results returned. Using this experience, we discuss barriers and opportunities
  associated with a comprehensive process of RoR in large-scale genomic research that
  may be useful for others developing their own policies.We performed whole-genome
  (nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x89184) and exome (nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x89208) sequencing of matched
  tumour-normal DNA pairs from 392 patients with sporadic pancreatic cancer (PC) as
  part of the APGI. We identified pathogenic germline mutations in candidate genes
  (nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x89130) with established predisposition to PC or medium-high penetrance
  genes with well-defined cancer associated syndromes or phenotypes. Variants from
  candidate genes were annotated and classified according to international guidelines.
  Variants were considered actionable if clinical utility was established, with regard
  to prevention, diagnosis, prognostication and/or therapy.A total of 48,904 germline
  variants were identified, with 2356 unique variants undergoing annotation and in
  silico classification. Twenty cases were deemed actionable and were returned via
  previously described RoR framework, representing an actionable finding rate of 5.1%.
  Overall, 1.78% of our cohort experienced clinical benefit from RoR.Returning research
  results within the context of large-scale genomics research is a labour-intensive,
  highly variable, complex operation. Results that warrant action are not infrequent,
  but the prevalence of those who experience a clinical difference as a result of
  returning individual results is currently low."
