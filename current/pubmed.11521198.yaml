abstract: Colorectal cancer has been described in terms of genetic instability selectively
  affecting either microsatellite sequences MIN or chromosome number and structure
  CIN . A subgroup with apparently stable, near-diploid chromosomes and stable microsatellites
  MACS also exists. These distinctions are important, partly because of their value
  in highlighting different pathways of carcinogenesis, and partly because of their
  direct relevance to prognosis. Study of early-onset cancer has often proved a fruitful
  resource for the identification of the nature and function of cancer susceptibility
  genes. In a study of colorectal cancer with stable microsatellite DNA, we describe
  22 early-onset tumours mean age 33 , compared with 16 late-onset tumours mean age
  68 . Both groups contained carcinomas with the MACS phenotype, characterized by
  near diploid DNA content, as defined by flow cytometry, and minimal chromosome arm
  deletion or amplification six or less events per genome , determined by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . Minimal chromosome imbalance correlated strongly with
  diploid DNA content P amp lt 0.001 . The proportion of MACS cancers was significantly
  greater in early-onset as compared to late-onset tumours 64 vs 13 , P 0.005 . Of
  the chromosome arm imbalances commonly observed in late-onset tumours, only 18q-
  was observed more than twice amongst the 14 early-onset MACS tumours. Seventy-nine
  per cent of these MACS tumours were located in the distal colon, and 69 were at
  advanced clinico-pathological stages with lymph node or distant metastasis . A positive
  family history of colorectal or other cancers was elicited in seven patients in
  the MACS early-onset group, and one additional patient in this group had a metachronous
  ovarian cancer. The results suggest that MACS cancer may have a genetic basis different
  from either MIN or CIN, and further studies of these cancers may lead to discovery
  of new mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and cancer susceptibility.
