abstract: The acquisition of drug-resistance is a major problem for cancer patients
  undergoing chemotherapy. To clarify genetic alterations in cancer cells that develop
  drug-resistance, comparative genomic hybridization CGH was applied to esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma cell lines SH-1V1, SH-1V2, SH-1V4 and SH-1V8 and chemoresistance-related
  genes in altered chromosomal regions were evaluated. These cell lines were derived
  from the parental SH-1 cell line, after multiple steps of selection by an increasing
  exposure to vindesine. SH-1V8 cells were strongly resistant to vindesine. DNA copy
  number at 16p which includes the MRP multidrug resistance related protein gene was
  markedly increased in all cell lines examined. Increased DNA copy numbers were found
  at the regions of 5q31-32, 10q11.1-23, and 14q32-qter in SH-1V8 cells that acquired
  resistance to other drugs as well. Both SH-1V4 and SH-1V8 showed increased DNA copy
  numbers at 7q11.1-22, 16q12.1-qter, 19p13.2-13.3, 19q11-13.2 and 20q13.1-qter. The
  chromosomal region of 7q11.1-22 including MDR-1 multidrug resistance-1 gene was
  highly amplified in SH-1V4 and SH-1V8. Amplification of the MRP region suggests
  the prerequisite of developing resistance to vindesine, and further amplification
  of MDR-1 may play a critical role in acquiring drug-resistance. Several unknown
  genes related to the induction of chemoresistance might be concealed in other altered
  chromosomal regions.
