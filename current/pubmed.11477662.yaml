abstract: Ependymomas are the third most common brain tumour in the paediatric population.
  Although cytogenetic and molecular analyses have pinpointed deletions of chromosomes
  6q, 17, and 22 in a subset of tumours, definitive patterns of genetic aberrations
  have not been determined. In the present study, we analysed 40 ependymomas from
  paediatric patients for genomic loss or gain using comparative genomic hybridisation
  CGH . Eighteen of the tumours 45 had no detectable regions of imbalance. In the
  remaining cases, the most common copy number aberrations were loss of 22 25 of tumours
  and gain of 1q 20 . Three regions of high copy number amplification were noted at
  1q24-31 three cases , 8q21-23 two cases , and 9p one case . Although there was no
  association with the loss or gain of any chromosome arm or with benign versus anaplastic
  histologic characteristics, the incidence of gain of 7q and 9p and loss of 17 and
  22 was significantly higher in recurrent versus primary tumours. This study has
  identified a number of chromosomal regions that may contain candidate genes involved
  in the development of different subgroups of ependymoma.
