abstract: We performed a genome wide screening for genomic alterations on a series
  of 19 sporadic primary central nervous system lymphomas PCNSL of the diffuse large
  B-cell type by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The tumors were additionally
  analyzed for amplification and rearrangement of the BCL2 gene at 18q21 as well as
  for mutation of the recently cloned BCL10 gene at 1p22. Eighteen tumors showed genomic
  imbalances on CGH analysis. On average, 2.1 losses and 4.7 gains were detected per
  tumor. The chromosome arm most frequently affected by losses of genomic material
  was 6q 47 with a commonly deleted region mapping to 6q21-q22. The most frequent
  gains involved chromosome arms 12q 63 , 18q and 22q 37 each , as well as 1q, 9q,
  11q, 12p, 16p and 17q 26 each . High-level amplifications were mapped to 9p23-p24
  1 tumor and to 18q21-q23 2 tumors . However, PCR-based analysis, Southern blot analysis
  and high-resolution matrix-CGH of the BCL2 gene revealed neither evidence for amplification
  nor for genetic rearrangement. Mutational analysis of BCL10 in 16 PCNSL identified
  four distinct sequence polymorphisms but no mutation. Taken together, our data do
  not support a role of BCL2 rearrangement amplification and BCL10 mutation in PCNSL
  but indicate a number of novel chromosomal regions that likely carry yet unknown
  tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes involved in the pathogenesis of these
  tumors.
