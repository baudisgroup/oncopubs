abstract: The current study investigated molecular cytogenetic characteristics of
  chronic myeloid leukemia CML using genome-wide, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays
  SNP-A capable of detecting cryptic submicroscopic genomic aberrations. Genome-Wide
  Human SNP 6.0 Array Affymetrix, CA, USA was performed in 118 patients having CML,
  chronic phase. Thirty-nine clonal aberrations CAs were identified 35 losses, two
  gains, two copy neutral loss of heterozygosity that were not detected by metaphase
  cytogenetics in 25 patients 21 . The 9q34 deletions were found in 10 of cases, while
  22q11.2 deletions were observed in 12 of cases. Seven patients 6 harbored both 5-ABL
  and 3-BCR deletions adjacent to the t 9 22 breakpoint. Copy number gains were identified
  at 8p and 9p, and losses at 2q, 7q, 8q, 9q, 11q, 13q, 16p, and 22q. When we compared
  the treatment outcome of imatinib therapy between patients with and without CAs
  identified by SNP-A, treatment failure and progression to advanced disease were
  not significantly different p amp gt 0.05 . In addition, according to the presence
  of deletions of 9q34 and or 22q11.2 identified by SNP-A, the treatment outcome did
  not show any significant differences p amp gt 0.05 . Our data suggests that SNP-A
  analysis is a useful tool for detection of clonal aberrations including deletions
  adjacent to the t 9 22 breakpoint in the CML cancer genome. However, clonal aberrations
  detected by SNP-A could not improve a prognostic stratification in CML patients
  with chronic phase.
