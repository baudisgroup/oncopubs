abstract: Using comparative genomic hybridisation, we investigated chromosomal imbalances
  in 28 cases of thymic epithelial neoplasms including type A, B2, B3, the A component
  of type AB and different subtypes of type C thymoma. To identify different patterns
  of chromosomal aberrations associated with the biological behaviour and the histological
  diversity of thymomas, a hierarchical cluster analysis of 65 cases was performed.
  The here-reported Comparative Genomic Hybridisation CGH data 28 cases of partly
  uninvestigated tumour subtypes were pooled with previously published data of chromosomal
  imbalances of 37 thymomas Zettl et al. Am J Pathol 2000 157:257-66 . The analysis
  of 278 chromosomal subbands yielded 2 main clusters. The first main cluster was
  characterised by gains of the chromosomal arm 1q, consisted only of type C and B3
  thymomas and was further subdivided into 2 subgroups. To the first subgroup only
  thymomas were attributed, which, in addition to gains of the chromosomal arm 1q,
  showed losses on 6q and 16q, whereas tumours belonging to the second subgroup exhibited
  no further recurrent chromosomal alterations. The second main cluster was formed
  by a heterogeneous group of thymoma types types A, AB, B2, B3 and C , showing no
  specific pattern of chromosomal imbalances. In 19 thymomas, no chromosomal imbalances
  could be detected 3 type B2 and 5 type A thymomas of our study as well as 11 type
  A thymomas investigated by Zettl et al., Am J Pathol 2000 157:257-66 . Chromosomal
  imbalances were more frequent in type C thymomas than in other subtypes. The distribution
  of tumour stages according to Masaoka p 0.003 and the World Health Organisation
  WHO classification p amp lt 0.0001 was significantly different in the clusters and
  subgroups obtained. The groups reflect the staging system and the WHO classification
  and show that type B3 and type C carcinomas have a strong relationship concerning
  their chromosomal imbalances. Furthermore, chromosomal imbalances detected in some
  type A thymomas might be responsible for the aggressive behaviour described in a
  few cases of this thymoma subtype.
