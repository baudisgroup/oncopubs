abstract: We report on genomic imbalances in 19 uterine and extrauterine carcinosarcomas
  and comparisons with findings in 7 endometrial adenocarcinomas using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . In the carcinosarcomas, the number of imbalances ranged
  from 2 to 27. Overrepresentations predominated over losses mean, 5.8 vs 4.3 and
  included gains or amplifications at 8q as the single most frequent change in 15
  of 19 carcinosarcomas, followed by overrepresentations at 3q 9 19 , 1q 7 19 , 6p
  7 19 , and 12p 7 19 . Losses were most common at 22q 9 19 , 16q 8 19 , 15q 7 19
  , 18q 7 19 , Xp 6 19 , and 9q 6 19 . Among 3 carcinosarcomas in which carcinomatous
  and sarcomatous elements could be analyzed separately, gains of 8q were identified
  in both components of one tumor and in the sarcomatous component of another tumor.
  Additional CGH analyses of 7 endometrial adenocarcinomas revealed simpler copy number
  changes, including recurrent gains at 8q 4 7 and 1q 4 7 , suggesting a central role
  of 8q gains in the pathogenesis of carcinosarcomas and endometrial adenocarcinomas.
