abstract: As subsets of pheochromocytomas (PCCs) lack a defined molecular etiology,
  we sought to characterize the mutational landscape of PCCs to identify novel gene
  candidates involved in disease development. A discovery cohort of 15 PCCs wild type
  for mutations in PCC susceptibility genes underwent whole-exome sequencing, and
  an additional 83 PCCs served as a verification cohort for targeted sequencing of
  candidate mutations. A low rate of nonsilent single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was
  detected (6.1/sample). Somatic HRAS and EPAS1 mutations were observed in one case
  each, whereas the remaining 13 cases did not exhibit variants in established PCC
  genes. SNVs aggregated in apoptosis-related pathways, and mutations in COSMIC genes
  not previously reported in PCCs included ZAN, MITF, WDTC1, and CAMTA1. Two somatic
  mutations and one constitutional variant in the well-established cancer gene lysine
  (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D, MLL2) were discovered in one sample each,
  prompting KMT2D screening using focused exome-sequencing in the verification cohort.
  An additional 11 PCCs displayed KMT2D variants, of which two were recurrent. In
  total, missense KMT2D variants were found in 14 (11 somatic, two constitutional,
  one undetermined) of 99 PCCs (14%). Five cases displayed somatic mutations in the
  functional FYR/SET domains of KMT2D, constituting 36% of all KMT2D-mutated PCCs.
  KMT2D expression was upregulated in PCCs compared to normal adrenals, and KMT2D
  overexpression positively affected cell migration in a PCC cell line. We conclude
  that KMT2D represents a recurrently mutated gene with potential implication for
  PCC development. ï¿½ 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  ï¿½ 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
