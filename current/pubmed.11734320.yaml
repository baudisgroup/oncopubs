abstract: 'Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is a very common and highly malignant tumor,
  associated mainly with chronic viral hepatitis, cirrhosis of any cause, aflatoxin
  exposure and ethanol consumption. The aim of this study was to map genomic aberrations
  in HCC by a recently developed technique: comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . We applied CGH on 17 liver specimens, of which seven were HCCs. The rest were
  benign liver tumors, cirrhotic and normal livers, and other liver malignancies.
  Our study included mainly large tumors mean size 10.5 cm unrelated to viral hepatitis
  or cirrhosis. Our CGH analysis detected genomic imbalances in 42 of HCCs. The common
  aberrations included DNA gains of 1q, 9p, and 8q and DNA losses of 17p, 13q, 9q,
  4q, and 11q. Also, we detected trisomies 8, 9, 18 and 21, which have not been reported
  previously. Gains and losses of DNA found in this study probably involve oncogenes
  and tumor suppressor genes that play a role in the puzzle of hepatocarcinogenesis.
  This study also suggests a possible link between the size of the tumor and the burden
  of genetic changes.'
