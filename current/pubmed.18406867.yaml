abstract: In an effort to identify novel genes implicated in breast carcinogenesis,
  a genomewide scan for loss of heterozygosity LOH and copy number changes in paired-DNA
  samples extracted from normal and tumor tissue of frozen sections from women undergoing
  surgery for invasive breast cancer was conducted. The Affymetrix 10K SNP array was
  used to examine genomewide LOH of chromosomal regions. The number of LOH events,
  number of informative loci, percent heterozygosity, and percent fractional allelic
  loss FAL were calculated. Although LOH events were detected in all samples, the
  proportion of LOH ranged from 0.1 to 57.2 . Elevated LOH events were detected in
  two samples, with a FAL of 57.2 and 56.2. Chromosomal regions exceeding a threshold
  value for a P-value curve based on multiple-testing adjusted permutation methods
  were identified as significant regions of shared LOH across samples. Regions with
  significant LOH included 2p25.3 2p21 2p15 approximately p16.1, 2q23.3 and, 16q12.1.
  Chromosomal region 1q32.1 was identified as a region with significant copy number
  amplification. Regions of LOH and copy number changes identified from this analysis
  may provide insights into the underlying processes of and genes involved in breast
  carcinogenesis. The present study demonstrates a feasible methodological approach
  for the assessment of LOH and copy number changes.
