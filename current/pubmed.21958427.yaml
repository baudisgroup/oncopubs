abstract: Inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene greatly increase the risk of developing
  breast cancer. Consistent with an important role for BRCA2 in error-free DNA repair,
  complex genomic changes are frequently observed in tumors derived from BRCA2 mutation
  carriers. Here, we explore the impact of DNA copy-number changes in BRCA2 tumors
  with respect to phenotype and clinical staging of the disease.
