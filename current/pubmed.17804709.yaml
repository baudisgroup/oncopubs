abstract: Cancer of the esophagus is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
  Esophageal carcinoma cell lines are useful models to study the biological and genetic
  alterations in these tumors. An important prerequisite of cell line research is
  the authenticity of the used cell lines because the mistaken identity of a cell
  line may lead to invalid conclusions. Estimates indicate that up to 36 of the cell
  lines are of a different origin or species than supposed. The TE series, established
  in late 1970s and early 1980s by Nishihira et al. in Japan, is one of the first
  esophageal cancer cell line series that was used throughout the world. Fourteen
  TE cell lines were derived from human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and one,
  TE-7, was derived from a primary esophageal adenocarcinoma. In numerous studies,
  this TE-7 cell line was used as a model for esophageal adenocarcinoma because it
  is one of the few esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines existing. We investigated
  the authenticity of the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line TE-7 by xenografting,
  short tandem repeat profiling, mutation analyses, and array-comparative genomic
  hybridization and showed that cell line TE-7 shared the same genotype as the esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma cell lines TE-2, TE-3, TE-12, and TE-13. In addition, for
  more than a decade, independent TE-7 cultures from Japan, United States, United
  Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands had the same genotype. Examination of the TE-7
  cell line xenograft revealed the histology of a squamous cell carcinoma. We conclude
  that the TE-7 cell line, used in several laboratories throughout the world, is not
  an adenocarcinoma, but a squamous cell carcinoma cell line. Furthermore, the cell
  lines TE-2, TE-3, TE-7, TE-12, and TE-13 should be regarded as one single squamous
  cell carcinoma cell line.
