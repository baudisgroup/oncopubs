abstract: The aim of this study was to elucidate cytogenetic changes in pancreatic
  cancers PCs and to examine their clinical implications. We screened for genetic
  alterations in 32 primary PCs including 4 cases with distant organ metastasis using
  comparative genomic hybridization coupled with tissue microdissection and degenerate
  oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR . The present study revealed
  frequent gains of chromosomes 13q and 15q and a loss of Xq in addition to a high
  prevalence of chromosomal imbalances. The average number of total genetic alterations
  and gains tended to be higher in N1 tumors TNM classification than in N0 tumors.
  The average number of amplifications was significantly higher in M1 tumors than
  in M0 tumors p 0.024 . Gain amplification of 20q was more frequently observed in
  M1 tumors than in M0 tumors p 0.016 , and this change was also detected in all of
  4 distant metastatic lesions. Losses of 6q, 8p, 9p, 17p, and 18q were recurrent
  in N0 and M0 tumors, and these alterations were also retained in N1 and M1 tumors.
  These observations suggest that these genetic losses contribute to the development
  of PCs and that increases in the DNA copy number confer an aggressive character
  on cancer cells. Especially, gain amplification of 20q was associated with the potential
  of distant organ metastasis of tumor cells.
