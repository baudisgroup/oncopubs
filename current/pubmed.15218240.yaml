abstract: We analyzed genetic changes in condylomas four cases , vulvar intraepithelial
  neoplasia I-III VIN I-III, eleven cases , and primary vulvar squamous cell carcinomas
  VSCC, ten cases by high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization HR-CGH and
  flowcytometry. All samples were also human papilloma virus HPV -genotyped. Gain
  of chromosome 1, the aberration most often seen in VIN III 67 , was not seen in
  HPV-positive or -negative VSCCs 0 . Both VIN III and VSCC frequently showed gain
  of 3q 56 and 70 , respectively . The VIN III samples often demonstrated gain of
  20q 56 and 20p 44 , and the VSCC samples gain of 8q 60 , loss of 3p 50 , and 8p
  40 . None of the four most frequent changes in the VSCC samples occurred exclusively
  in the HPV-positive or -negative samples. As expected, we did not find any cytogenetic
  changes in condylomas and nearly any changes in VIN I-II.
