abstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of
  the serum anti-p53 antibody in patients with uterine and ovarian cancer. Some of
  the ovarian patients were also evaluated for overexpression of p53 by immunohistochemistry
  and for cytogenetic alterations by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Serum
  anti-p53 antibodies were determined by an enzyme immunoassay kit. The antibody was
  detected in 8 30 27 of ovarian cancers, in 12 86 14 cancers of the uterine cervix,
  in 5 41 12 cancers of the uterine body, and 0 9 0 healthy women. The overall survival
  rate in patients with ovarian cancer was significantly worse in patients with anti-p53
  antibody positivity than that in patients with anti-p53-antibody-negative cancers
  using the log rank test p 0.017 . There was a significant correlation between the
  presence of anti-p53 antibody and tissue overexpression of p53 in ovarian cancers.
  CGH analysis showed that the aberrations in DNA sequence copy number in ovarian
  cancers were significantly increased in anti-p53-antibody-positive cases compared
  to antip53-antibody-negative cases including increased copy number on 20q and reduced
  copy number on 5q and 13q. Although the exact relationship between the presence
  of serum anti-p53 antibody specific humoral response and cytogenetic alterations
  is still unknown, these findings suggest that the measurement of serum anti-p53
  antibody may be useful for the assessment of genetic instability and tumor biological
  aggressiveness.
