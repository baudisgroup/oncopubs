abstract: 'In this study, we used single nucleotide polymorphism and comparative genomic
  hybridization array to study DNA copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity
  for 28 patients affected by S zary syndrome SS , a rare form of cutaneous T-cell
  lymphoma CTCL . Our data identified, further confirming previous studies, recurrent
  losses of 17p13.2-p11.2 and 10p12.1-q26.3 occurring in 71 and 68 of cases, respectively
  common gains were detected for 17p11.2-q25.3 64 and chromosome 8 8q 50 . Moreover,
  we identified novel genomic lesions recurring in amp gt 30 of tumors: loss of 9q13-q21.33
  and gain of 10p15.3-10p12.2. Individual chromosomal aberrations did not show a significant
  correlation with prognosis however, when more than three recurrent chromosomal alterations
  gain or loss were considered, a statistical association was observed using Kaplan-Meier
  survival analysis. Integrating mapping and transcriptional data, we were able to
  identify a total of 113 deregulated transcripts in aberrant chromosomal regions
  that included cancer-related genes such as members of the NF-kappaB pathway BAG4,
  BTRC, NKIRAS2, PSMD3, and TRAF2 that might explain its constitutive activation in
  CTCL. Matching this list of genes with those discriminating patients with different
  survival times, we identify several common candidates that might exert critical
  roles in SS, such as BUB3 and PIP5K1B. Altogether, our study confirms and maps more
  precisely the regions of gain and loss and, combined to transcriptional profiles,
  suggests a novel set of genes of potential interest in SS.'
