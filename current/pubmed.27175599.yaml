abstract: Mutation profiles and intratumoral heterogeneity are not well understood
  for benign gastric adenomas, some of which progress into malignant gastric adenocarcinomas.
  In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of three microsatellite stable
  (MSS) and two microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gastric adenomas with three
  regional tumor biopsies per case. We observed that the mutation abundance of benign
  gastric adenomas was comparable to those of gastric adenocarcinomas, suggesting
  that the mutational makeup for gastric carcinogenesis may already be achieved in
  benign adenomas. The extent of intratumoral heterogeneity was more substantial for
  MSS genomes in that only 1% - 14% of somatic mutations were common across the regional
  biopsies or 'public', while 50% - 94% of mutations were public in MSI-H gastric
  adenomas. We observed biallelic, loss-of-functional events of APC with truncating
  mutations and/or 5q losses for all cases, mostly as public events. All MSS gastric
  adenomas also harbored ARID2 truncating mutations, often as multiple, region-specific
  ones indicative of convergent evolution. Hotspot missense mutations on known cancer
  genes such as ERBB2 and KRAS were largely observed as region-specific aberrations.
  These findings suggest that biallelic functional APC inactivation initiates the
  gastric carcinogenesis and is followed by mutations of histone modifiers and then
  activation of known cancer-related genes. As the first exome-wide multi-region mutational
  profiling of gastric adenomas, our study provides clues on the chronological sequence
  of somatic mutations and their clonal architectures in early gastric carcinogenesis.
