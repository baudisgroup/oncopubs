abstract: 'To elucidate molecular features associated with disproportionate survival
  of glioblastoma (GB) patients, we conducted deep genomic comparative analysis of
  a cohort of patients receiving standard therapy (surgery plus concurrent radiation
  and temozolomide); "GB outliers" were identified: long-term survivor of 33 months
  (LTS; n = 8) versus short-term survivor of 7 months (STS; n = 10).We implemented
  exome, RNA, whole genome sequencing, and DNA methylation for collection of deep
  genomic data from STS and LTS GB patients.LTS GB showed frequent chromosomal gains
  in 4q12 (platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and KIT) and 12q14.1 (cyclin-dependent
  kinase 4), and deletion in 19q13.33 (BAX, branched chain amino-acid transaminase
  2, and cluster of differentiation 33). STS GB showed frequent deletion in 9p11.2
  (forkhead box D4-like 2 and aquaporin 7 pseudogene 3) and 22q11.21 (Hypermethylated
  In Cancer 2). LTS GB showed 2-fold more frequent copy number deletions compared
  with STS GB. Gene expression differences showed the STS cohort with altered transcriptional
  regulators: activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5a/b,
  nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB), and interferon-gamma (IFNG), and inhibition of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and estrogen
  receptor (ESR)1. Expression-based biological concepts prominent in the STS cohort
  include metabolic processes, anaphase-promoting complex degradation, and immune
  processes associated with major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation;
  the LTS cohort features genes related to development, morphogenesis, and the mammalian
  target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Whole genome methylation analyses showed
  that a methylation signature of 89 probes distinctly separates LTS from STS GB tumors.We
  posit that genomic instability is associated with longer survival of GB (possibly
  with vulnerability to standard therapy); conversely, genomic and epigenetic signatures
  may identify patients where up-front entry into alternative, targeted regimens would
  be a preferred, more efficacious management.'
