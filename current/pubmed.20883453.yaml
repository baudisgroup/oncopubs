abstract: In this study, we investigated the mechanism s of altered expression of
  protooncogene SKP2 in metastatic melanoma and its clinical relevance in patients
  with metastatic melanoma. The genomic status of SKP2 was assessed in cell lines
  by sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array, and genomic PCR. Copy number
  status was then evaluated for concordance with SKP2 mRNA and protein expression.
  SKP2 protein was further evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 93 human metastatic
  tissues. No mutations were identified in SKP2. Increased copy number at the SKP2
  locus was observed in 6 14 43 metastatic cell lines and in 9 22 41 human metastatic
  tissues which was associated with overexpression of SKP2 protein. Overexpression
  of SKP2 protein in human tissues was associated with worse survival in a multivariate
  model controlling for the site of metastasis. Copy number gain is a major contributing
  mechanism of SKP2 overexpression in metastatic melanoma. Results may have implications
  for the development of therapeutics that target SKP2.
