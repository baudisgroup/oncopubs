abstract: Esthesioneuroblastoma ENB are rare tumors originating from the olfactory
  epithelium of the superior nasal cavity. This lesion is morphologically closely
  related to Ewing sarcoma and other peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors pPNET
  . The affiliation of ENB to the pPNET family is still under discussion. Only very
  limited and contradictory cytogenetic data are available on ENB and only one patient
  has been analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , so far. In the present
  study, genomic imbalances of three ENB were analyzed by CGH to evaluate 1 a recurrent
  pattern of imbalances, and 2 its relation to the pPNET family. The CGH analysis
  of three ENB revealed multiple recurrent aberrations including DNA overrepresentations
  of chromosomal material of the entire chromosome 19, partial gains of the long arms
  of chromosomes 8, 15, and 22, and deletions of the entire long arm of chromosome
  4. Beside these common aberrations, several single gains and losses occurred, that
  is, gains on 6p, 10q, 1p, 9q, and 13q. We confirmed the former observation of amplified
  genetic material on chromosome 8 and found several new, currently not described
  recurrent genetic aberrations distinct from those described for pPNET. Our findings
  give evidence that ENB is not part of the pPNET family. We suggest that the combined
  gain of genetic material on 15q, 22q, and chromosome 8 might be indicative for ENB.
  To verify our findings and to define prognosis-related aberrations, a larger number
  of cases needs to be studied.
