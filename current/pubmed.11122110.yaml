abstract: Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , aberrations in DNA copy number
  were studied before and after transformation of follicular lymphoma to diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma in six patients 15 lymph node biopsies in total . The most common
  and also the most discrete and intense amplification occurring in four out of 15
  biopsies from three different patients was of 2p13-16. Using real-time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction RQ-PCR , REL amplification was found to be implicated
  at this locus. This technique also identified amplified REL in a further two biopsies,
  presumably below the detection level of CGH. REL amplification was quantified by
  comparing it, in most cases, with three endogenous reference genes, albumin, beta2-microglobulin
  and CD8alpha, that lie close to REL on 2p. There was no correlation apparent between
  2p13-16 amplification or REL amplification and transformation. This study shows
  the usefulness of coupling CGH, for detecting recurring abnormalities, with the
  real-time PCR technique for rapid gene dosage quantification and confirms that the
  REL gene is a potential candidate in the pathogenesis of a particular subset of
  follicular lymphomas.
