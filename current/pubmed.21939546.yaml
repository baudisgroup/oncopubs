abstract: Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are major contributors
  to hereditary breast ovarian cancer. Large rearrangements are less frequent in the
  BRCA2 gene than in BRCA1. We report, here, the first total deletion of exon 3 in
  the BRCA2 gene that was detected during screening of 2058 index cases from breast
  ovarian cancer families for BRCA2 large rearrangements. Deletion of exon 3, which
  is in phase, does not alter the reading frame. Low levels of alternative transcripts
  lacking exon 3 3 delta3 transcript have been reported in normal tissues, which raises
  the question whether deletion of exon 3 is pathogenic.
