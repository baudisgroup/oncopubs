abstract: '15q24 deletion syndrome is a recently-described chromosomal disorder, characterized
  by developmental delay, growth deficiency, distinct facial features, digital abnormalities,
  loose connective tissue, and genital malformations in males. To date, 19 patients
  have been reported. We report on a 13-year-old boy with this syndrome manifesting
  childhood myelodysplastic syndrome MDS . He had characteristic facial features,
  hypospadias, and mild developmental delay. He showed neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
  for several years. At age 13 years, bone marrow examination was performed, which
  showed a sign suggestive of childhood MDS: mild dysplasia in the myeloid, erythroid,
  and megakaryocytic cell lineages. Array comparative genomic hybridization array
  CGH revealed a de novo 3.4 Mb 15q24.1q24.3 deletion. Although MDS has not been described
  in patients with the syndrome, a boy was reported to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  ALL . The development of MDS and hematological malignancy in the syndrome might
  be caused by the haploinsufficiency of deleted 15q24 segment either alone or in
  combination with other genetic abnormalities in hematopoietic cells. Further hematological
  investigation is recommended to be beneficial if physical and hematological examination
  results are suggestive of hematopoietic disturbance in patients with the syndrome.'
