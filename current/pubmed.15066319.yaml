abstract: Although genomic DNA microarray array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH technique is a rapid and powerful diagnostic tool for the comprehensive analysis
  of detailed chromosomal alterations of DNA copy numbers, its accuracy has not been
  well demonstrated. To clarify the accuracy of this technique, we applied array CGH
  spotted with 283 specific genes to 11 clinical prostate cancers, and the results
  were compared with comparative genomic hybridization conventional CGH and loss of
  heterozygosity LOH analysis using microsatellite DNA markers. The overall rate of
  correspondence between array CGH and conventional CGH with respect to the loss of
  DNA sequences was 94.5 . When the results of both CGH techniques were compared with
  those of LOH analysis, the correspondence rate of array CGH was significantly higher
  than that of conventional CGH 93.4 vs. 72.2 , P amp lt 0.05 . In conclusion, the
  accuracy of array CGH was higher than that of conventional CGH in detecting losses
  of the DNA sequences. Array CGH is shown to be a promising tool for screening to
  identify unknown genes involved in tumorigenesis in prostate cancer.
