abstract: Chromosomal aberrations of 20 stage 4s neuroblastomas were analysed by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . In a subset of 13 20 tumours, telomerase activity was
  evaluated by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol TRAP . The CGH data were
  compared with the CGH results of ten stage 1 and 2 stage 1 2 and 22 stage 3 and
  4 stage 3 4 neuroblastomas. A total of 17 20 stage 4s neuroblastomas did not progress
  clinically, whereas tumour progression with lethal outcome occurred in 3 20 cases.
  The CGH data of clinically non-progressing stage 4s tumours revealed a high rate
  of whole-chromosome aberrations 73.4 with an overrepresentation of mainly chromosomes
  2, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 and an underrepresentation of mainly chromosomes 3, 4, 11,
  14. MYCN amplification or 1p deletion was observed in only 1 27 or 2 17 clinically
  non-progressing stage 4s tumours respectively, whereas all three progressive stage
  4s neuroblastomas showed MYCN amplification, 1p deletion and, in 2 3 cases, distal
  17q gains. Except for one case, telomerase activity was not observed in non-progressing
  stage 4s neuroblastomas. In contrast, 4s tumours with lethal outcome revealed elevated
  telomerase activity levels. Our data suggest that stage 4s neuroblastomas belong
  to two biologically different groups, one of which displays the genetic features
  of localized stage 1 2 tumours, whereas the other mimics advanced stage 3 4 neuroblastomas.
