abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH is a powerful tool to
  detect genomic imbalances in the human genome. The analysis of aCGH data sets has
  revealed the existence of a widespread technical artifact termed as waves, characterized
  by an undulating data profile along the chromosome. Here, we describe the development
  of a novel noise-reduction algorithm, waves aCGH correction algorithm WACA , based
  on GC content and fragment size correction. WACA efficiently removes the wave artifact,
  thereby greatly improving the accuracy of aCGH data analysis. We describe the application
  of WACA to both real and simulated aCGH data sets, and demonstrate that our algorithm,
  by systematically correcting for all known sources of bias, is a significant improvement
  on existing aCGH noise reduction algorithms. WACA and associated files are freely
  available as Supplementary Data.
