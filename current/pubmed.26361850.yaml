abstract: Leiomyosarcomas are malignant mesenchymal tumors that recapitulate smooth
  muscle cell differentiation. Tumors are characterized by a genetic heterogeneity
  with complex karyotypes without a tumor-specific genetic aberration. Their pathobiology
  is still poorly understood and no specific targeted treatment is currently available
  for these aggressive tumors. For six leiomyosarcomas, cells were cultured and analyzed
  by combined binary ratio labeling fluorescence in situ hybridization (COBRA-FISH)
  karyotyping. A t(6;14) was identified in two cases. FISH breakpoint mapping of case
  L1339 reveals a breakpoint at chromosome 6p21.31 close to HMGA1, and a small deletion
  was observed on the distal side of the gene. A small homozygous deletion was also
  found in the breakpoint region of chromosome 14q24.1 involving ACTN1. The second
  case revealed a der(6)t(6;14)(p21.1;q21.3), with a duplication adjacent to the breakpoint
  at chromosome 6. Confirmatory FISH revealed a second leiomyosarcoma with an aberration
  at 14q24.1. Alterations at this locus were found in 5% (2 of 39) of the leiomyosarcomas
  in this study. The other identified breakpoints appeared to be non-recurrent, because
  they were not detected in other leiomyosarcomas, uterine leiomyomas, undifferentiated
  spindle cell sarcomas, or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas.  Copyright ï¿½
