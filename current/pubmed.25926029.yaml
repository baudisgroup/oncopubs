abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common pediatric primary malignant bone tumor.
  As the prognosis for patients following standard treatment did not improve for almost
  three decades, functional preclinical models that closely reflect important clinical
  cancer characteristics are urgently needed to develop and evaluate new treatment
  strategies. The objective of this study was to establish an orthotopic xenotransplanted
  mouse model using patient-derived tumor tissue.  Fresh tumor tissue from an adolescent
  female patient with osteosarcoma after relapse was surgically xenografted into the
  right tibia of 6 immunodeficient BALB/c Nu/Nu mice as well as cultured into medium.
  Tumor growth was serially assessed by palpation and with magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI). In parallel, a primary cell line of the same tumor was established. Histology
  and high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) were used
  to investigate both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of different passages
  of human xenografts and the cell line compared to the tissue of origin.  A primary
  OS cell line and a primary patient-derived orthotopic xenotranplanted mouse model
  were established. MRI analyses and histopathology demonstrated an identical architecture
  in the primary tumor and in the xenografts. Array-CGH analyses of the cell line
  and all xenografts showed highly comparable patterns of genomic progression. So
  far, three further primary patient-derived orthotopic xenotranplanted mouse models
  could be established.  We report the first orthotopic OS mouse model generated by
  transplantation of tumor fragments directly harvested from the patient. This model
  represents the morphologic and genomic identity of the primary tumor and provides
  a preclinical platform to evaluate new treatment strategies in OS.
