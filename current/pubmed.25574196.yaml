abstract: 'Genetic alterations in the early stages of cancer have a close correlation
  with tumor initiation and potentially activate downstream pathways implicated in
  tumor progression; however, the method of initiation in sporadic neoplasias is largely
  unknown. In this study, whole-genome microarray-comparative genomic hybridization
  was performed to identify the early genetic alterations that define the prognosis
  of patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. The most striking
  finding was the high frequency of copy number losses and hemizygous deletions on
  chromosome 8p, which occurred in 94.7% (18/19) and 63.2% (12/19) of the cases, respectively,
  with a delineated minimal common region of 8p21.1-p23.3. More specifically, three
  loci of homozygous deletions at 8p23.1 were noted in 21.1% (4/19) of the cases.
  This region contains the following possible target genes, which have previously
  not been implicated to play a pathogenic role in stage I SCCs: MSRA, MFHAS1, CLDN23,
  DEFB106A, DEFB105A, LOC441316, FAM90A7P and LOC441318. These findings indicate that
  genetic alterations on chromosome 8p may be the first step in the initiation of
  genomic instability in early SCCs, and the newly identified genes in the 8p23.1
  chromosomal region might be of interest for the study of the pathophysiology of
  stage I SCC, as potential targets for therapeutic measures.'
