abstract: Melanomas on mucosal membranes, acral skin soles, palms, and nail bed ,
  and skin with chronic sun-induced damage have infrequent mutations in BRAF and NRAS,
  genes within the mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase pathway commonly mutated in
  melanomas on intermittently sun-exposed skin. This raises the question of whether
  other aberrations are occurring in the MAP kinase cascade in the melanoma types
  with infrequent mutations of BRAF and NRAS.
