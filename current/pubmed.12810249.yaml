abstract: Cytogenetic and molecular studies of radiation-induced meningiomas RIM are
  rare and controversial. While comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis identified
  monosomy 22 as the predominant change in RIM, occurring in frequencies comparable
  to those found in spontaneous meningioma SM , molecular genetic analysis shows infrequent
  loss of chromosome 22 DNA markers. We have performed CGH analysis of six additional
  cases of RIM and detected an unbalanced genome in five of 6 cases. Loss of 1p and
  7p was identified in the majority of RIM with an abnormal karyotype 4 5 cases ,
  whereas loss of 6q occurred in three of five cases. Only one of five RIM had monosomy
  for chromosome 22. Loss of 7p is not frequently reported in SM and yet it was detected
  in four of 5 RIM with an abnormal karyotype in our study. Molecular and cytogenetic
  studies of chromosome 7 copy number should be attempted on a larger number of RIM
  to further investigate the role of 7p loss in RIM.
