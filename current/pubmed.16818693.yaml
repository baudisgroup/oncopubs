abstract: The main procedure to confirm a suspected diagnosis of prostate cancer is
  histologic analysis of ultrasound-guided sextant prostate biopsies. As it is difficult
  to reliably assess tumor stage and grade in such minute samples, the clinical significance
  of some tumor foci remains unclear. Genetic markers that could augment pretreatment
  prognostic information would improve the clinical management of the disease.

  and were therefore estimated to have material for successful CGH analysis. The other
  samples were excluded from the database.
