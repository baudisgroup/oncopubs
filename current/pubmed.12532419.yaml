abstract: The coding region determinant binding protein CRD-BP was isolated by virtue
  of its high affinity to the c-myc mRNA coding region stability determinant and shown
  to shield this message from nucleolytic attack, prolonging its half-life. CRD-BP
  is normally expressed during fetal life but is also activated de novo in tumors.
  Considering that aberrant CRD-BP expression may represent an additional mechanism
  interfering with c-myc regulation, we screened 118 primary breast carcinomas for
  CRD-BP expression, 60 of which had also been analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Copy number gains encompassing 8q24, the chromosome band that contains the
  c-myc locus, were detected in 48.3 29 60 of tumors, whereas gains involving band
  17q21, which contains the CRD-BP locus, were observed in 18.3 11 60 of tumors. CRD-BP
  expression was detected in 58.5 69 118 of tumors, implying mechanisms of activation
  alternative to gene amplification. Altogether, some 75 of the tumors had alterations
  pertaining to c-myc since they either harbored 8q24 gains and or expressed CRD-BP.
  Significant associations were detected between CRD-BP expression and the absence
  of estrogen receptors p 0.005 and between the presence of 8q24 gains and an increased
  number of genomic changes as measured by CGH p 0.0017 . Tumors were divided into
  4 groups according to CRD-BP expression and 8q24 gains. The odds for tumors having
  both characteristics to be classified as poorly differentiated grade III vs. grade
  I and II were 19.6 times the corresponding odds for tumors neither expressing CRD-BP
  nor harboring 8q24 gains. For tumors either harboring 8q24 gains only or expressing
  CRD-BP alone, the corresponding odds were 6.4 and 3, respectively.
