abstract: Genomic DNA copy number aberrations are frequent in solid tumors, although
  the underlying causes of chromosomal instability in tumors remain obscure. Genes
  likely to have genomic instability phenotypes when mutated e.g. those involved in
  mitosis, replication, repair, and telomeres are rarely mutated in chromosomally
  unstable sporadic tumors, even though such mutations are associated with some heritable
  cancer prone syndromes.
