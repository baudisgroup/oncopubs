abstract: The first Swiss human embryonic stem cell hESC line, CH-ES1, has shown features
  of a malignant cell line. It originated from the only single blastomere that survived
  cryopreservation of an embryo, and it more closely resembles teratocarcinoma lines
  than other hESC lines with respect to its abnormal karyotype and its formation of
  invasive tumors when injected into SCID mice. The aim of this study was to characterize
  the molecular basis of the oncogenicity of CH-ES1 cells, we looked for abnormal
  chromosomal copy number by array Comparative Genomic Hybridization, aCGH and single
  nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs . To see how unique these changes were, we compared
  these results to data collected from the 2102Ep teratocarcinoma line and four hESC
  lines H1, HS293, HS401 and SIVF-02 which displayed normal G-banding result. We identified
  genomic gains and losses in CH-ES1, including gains in areas containing several
  oncogenes. These features are similar to those observed in teratocarcinomas, and
  this explains the high malignancy. The CH-ES1 line was trisomic for chromosomes
  1, 9, 12, 17, 19, 20 and X. Also the karyotypically based on G-banding normal hESC
  lines were also found to have several genomic changes that involved genes with known
  roles in cancer. The largest changes were found in the H1 line at passage number
  56, when large 5 Mb duplications in chromosomes 1q32.2 and 22q12.2 were detected,
  but the losses and gains were seen already at passage 22. These changes found in
  the other lines highlight the importance of assessing the acquisition of genetic
  changes by hESCs before their use in regenerative medicine applications. They also
  point to the possibility that the acquisition of genetic changes by ESCs in culture
  may be used to explore certain aspects of the mechanisms regulating oncogenesis.
