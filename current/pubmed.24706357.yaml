abstract: Molecular changes associated with the progression of glioblastoma after
  standard radiochemotherapy remain poorly understood. We compared genomic profiles
  of 27 paired primary and recurrent IDH1 2 wild-type glioblastomas by genome-wide
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization. By bioinformatic analysis, primary
  and recurrent tumor profiles were normalized and segmented, chromosomal gains and
  losses identified taking the tumor cell content into account, and difference profiles
  deduced. Seven of 27 26 pairs lacked DNA copy number differences between primary
  and recurrent tumors equal pairs . The recurrent tumors in 9 27 33 pairs contained
  all chromosomal imbalances of the primary tumors plus additional ones, suggesting
  a sequential acquisition of and or selection for aberrations during progression
  sequential pairs . In 11 27 41 pairs, the profiles of primary and recurrent tumors
  were divergent, i.e., the recurrent tumors contained additional aberrations but
  had lost others, suggesting a polyclonal composition of the primary tumors and considerable
  clonal evolution discrepant pairs . Losses on 9p21.3 harboring the CDKN2A B locus
  were significantly more common in primary tumors from sequential and discrepant
  nonequal pairs. Nonequal pairs showed ten regions of recurrent genomic differences
  between primary and recurrent tumors harboring 46 candidate genes associated with
  tumor recurrence. In particular, copy numbers of genes encoding apoptosis regulators
  were frequently changed at progression. In summary, approximately 25 of IDH1 2 wild-type
  glioblastoma pairs have stable genomic imbalances. In contrast, approximately 75
  of IDH1 2 wild-type glioblastomas undergo further genomic aberrations and alter
  their clonal composition upon recurrence impacting their genomic profile, a process
  possibly facilitated by 9p21.3 loss in the primary tumor. c 2014 Wiley Periodicals,
