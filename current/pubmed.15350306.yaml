abstract: The advancement of fluorescence in situ hybridization-based assays has permitted
  more refined delineation of chromosomal loci involved in complex chromosomal rearrangements
  CCRs and gene amplification. In this detailed molecular cytogenetic analysis, spectral
  karyotyping SKY , multicolor banding mBAND analysis, and microarray comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH were used to refine the analysis of chromosomes with amplifications
  and small intrachromosomal rearrangements such as inverted duplications and interstitial
  deletions present in the osteosarcoma cell line MG-63. SKY analysis has limited
  resolving power to delineate cryptic chromosomal rearrangements, so mBAND assays
  were performed for a subset of chromosomes i.e., 6, 8, 17, and 20 . Of the 10 clonal
  CCRs analyzed in detail with mBAND, 5 were found to have rearrangements between
  8q24 and either 6p23 approximately pter or 6p21, with multiple copies of this translocation
  inserted at various sites in the different chromosomes. In two CCRs, 6p21 and 8q24
  generated an alternating pattern of mBAND probe hybridization, indicating the presence
  of a large coamplified repeat unit within homogeneously staining regions. Microarray
  CGH analysis demonstrated focal high-level amplification of 8q23 approximately q24,
  6p22 approximately pter, and 6p21, in agreement with the pattern of chromosome subband
  gains identified with mBAND. Thus, sequential SKY, mBAND, and microarray CGH provided
  a comprehensive description of some of the intricate chromosomal aberrations present
  in the complex MG-63 karyotype and permitted reconstruction of the fine structure
  of the genomic rearrangements, thus providing some important mechanistic clues concerning
  the details of the amplification process in tumors.
