abstract: In hepatocellular carcinoma HCC , multifocal growth may be due to intrahepatic
  metastatic spread or to the multicentric origin of clonal neoplasms. Although this
  issue is of potential clinical and prognostic importance, reliable differentiation
  cannot be achieved using clinical or morphological criteria alone. In this study,
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to differentiate between metastatic
  spread and multicentric growth in two cases of HCC. In the first case, six carcinoma
  nodules were examined. The affected chromosomes and their pattern of aberrations
  were almost identical for all six nodules. In addition to aberrations of chromosomes
  1, 4, 9, and 13, further aberrations were observed for chromosomes 2, 5, 7, and
  17, which are less typical for HCC. These findings were seen as indicative of metastatic
  spread of the HCC. In the second case, 75 3 4 of the nodules showed comparable aberration
  patterns involving chromosomes 1, 4, 8, 13, and 17, together with a number of further
  aberrations also not frequently seen in HCC including chromosomes 5, 7, 10, 12,
  14, and 18. Chromosomes 4, 5, 8, 10, and 12 were also altered in the fourth nodule
  examined for this case, but they exhibited a unique aberration pattern. Additionally,
  gain of chromosome 15q was seen in only this fourth nodule. In the two cases examined,
  metastatic spread and multicentric origin of HCC could be differentiated by different
  patterns of karyotypic change. The CGH results were confirmed by fluorescence in
  situ hybridization FISH . In conclusion, CGH facilitates the differentiation of
  multicentric growth from metastatic spread in HCC and appears to be superior to
  techniques previously used to resolve this clinically important diagnostic problem.
