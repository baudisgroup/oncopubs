abstract: To search for new recurrent genetic aberrations in malignant fibrous histiocytoma
  MFH , a combination of conventional cytogenetic, comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , and Southern blot analyses was applied to a series of 34 tumors. Cytogenetic
  analysis revealed the presence of multiple structural and numerical aberrations,
  including marker chromosomes, telomeric associations, double minutes, and ring chromosomes.
  The most frequent genomic imbalances in this series of neoplasms as detected by
  CGH were gains of 1q21-q22 69 , 17q23-qter 41 , and 20q 66 , and losses of 9p21-pter
  55 , 10q 48 , 11q23-qter 55 , and 13q10-q31 55 . Southern blot analyses with p16
  INK4A CDKN2A 9p21 and RB1 13q14 probes provided clear indications for frequent deletions
  of these tumor suppressor genes, and as such, substantiated the CGH results. Additionally,
  examination of the TP53 and MDM2 genes showed frequent loss and amplification, respectively.
  These data indicate that genes involved in the RB1- and TP53-associated cell cycle
  regulatory pathways may play prominent roles in the development of human MFH.
