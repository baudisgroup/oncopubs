abstract: Pathogenesis and genetic abnormalities of ependymomas are not well known
  and differential diagnosis with choroid plexus tumors may be difficult when these
  tumors are located in the ventricles. We analyzed 16 samples of primary pediatric
  ependymomas and seven choroid plexus tumors for significant gains or losses of genomic
  DNA, using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Four ependymoma samples were
  obtained after surgery for relapse, including one patient whose tumor was analyzed
  at diagnosis and at first and second relapses. Three out of 16 ependymomas and none
  of the choroid plexus tumors appeared normal by CGH. In the remaining ependymomas,
  the number of regions with genomic imbalance was limited. The most frequent copy
  number abnormality in ependymomas was 22q loss. In one patient from whom multiple
  samples could be analyzed during tumor progression, no abnormality was present at
  diagnosis gain of chromosome 9 and loss of 6q were observed at first relapse and,
  at second relapse, additional genomic imbalances were loss of 3p, 10q, and chromosome
  15. In choroid plexus tumors, recurrent abnormalities were gains of chromosome 7
  and region 12q. The recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were clearly different between
  ependymomas and choroid plexus papillomas CPP . Recurrent loss of 22q suggests that
  this region harbors tumor suppressor genes important in the pathogenesis of ependymomas
  however, other pathogenic pathways may exist involving 6q and chromosome 10 losses
  or gain of 1q and chromosome 9. CPP can be distinguished from ependymoma on the
  basis of CGH abnormalities.
