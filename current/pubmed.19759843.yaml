abstract: Cancer of the ovary is bilateral in 25 . Cytogenetic analysis could determine
  whether the disease in bilateral cases is metastatic or two separately occurring
  primary tumors, but karyotypic information comparing the two cancerous ovaries is
  limited to a single report with 11 informative cases. We present a series of 32
  bilateral ovarian carcinoma cases, analyzed by karyotyping and high-resolution CGH.
  Our karyotypic findings showed that spreading to the contralateral ovary had occurred
  in bilateral ovarian cancer cases and that it was a late event in the clonal evolution
  of the tumors. This was confirmed by the large number of similar changes detected
  by HR-CGH in the different lesions from the same patient. The chromosomal bands
  most frequently involved in structural rearrangements were 19p13 n 12 and 19q13
  n 11 . The chromosomal bands most frequently gained by both tumorous ovaries were
  5p14 70 , 8q23-24 65 , 1q23-24 57 , and 12p12 48 , whereas the most frequently lost
  bands were 17p11 78 , 17p13 74 , 17p12 70 , 22q13 61 , 8p21 and 19q13 52 , and 8p22-23
  48 . This is the first time that 5p14 is seen gained at such a high frequency in
  cancer of the ovary possibly oncogene s involved in bilateral ovarian carcinogenesis
  or tumor progression may reside in this band.
