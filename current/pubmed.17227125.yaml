abstract: Previous chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization CGH studies of papillary
  thyroid carcinoma PTC have demonstrated a low prevalence of aberrations, with the
  majority of tumors showing no evidence of chromosomal instability. The technique
  of CGH can be optimized, however, using array CGH and laser capture microdissection
  to ensure pure cell populations for analysis.
