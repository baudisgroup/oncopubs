abstract: Neuroblastoma is the most common, pediatric, extra-cranial, malignant solid
  tumor. Despite multimodal therapeutic protocols, outcome for children with a high-risk
  clinical phenotype remains poor, with long-term survival still less than 40 . Hereby,
  we evaluated the potential of non-coding RNA expression to predict outcome in high-risk,
  stage 4 neuroblastoma.
