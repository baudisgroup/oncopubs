abstract: The occurrence of secondary chromosome changes is frequent in Ewing tumors,
  in particular trisomies for chromosomes 8 and 12, and unbalanced 1 16 translocations
  leading to gains of 1q and losses of 16q. The prognostic value of these secondary
  aberrations has not been statistically demonstrated. We report here a CGH analysis
  of a series of 43 primary tumors corresponding to 21 localized and 22 metastatic
  tumors. For five of them, a sufficient amount of DNA for the CGH analysis was available
  from the frozen samples. For 19 samples, a preliminary step of DOP-PCR amplification
  of the DNA was necessary. For the last 19 tumors, DNA was obtained after DOP-PCR
  amplification of small amount of DNA contaminating the RNA. As a whole, the main
  chromosome imbalances previously described, such as trisomies for 1q, 8, and 12,
  were observed. It is noteworthy that the mean number of imbalances was more frequent
  in localized versus metastatic tumors. Gain of 1q was more frequent in metastatic
  than in localized tumors. Nevertheless, these two results do not reach statistical
  significance. Conversely, a statistically significant excess of copy number of chromosome
  2 was observed in non-metastatic tumors, suggesting that this imbalance, which has
  never been previously reported, could be associated with more favorable tumor behavior.
