abstract: 'Allelic imbalance is a common feature of many malignancies. We have measured
  allelic imbalance in genomic DNA from the breast cancer cell lines T47D, MDA-MB-231,
  two antiestrogen sensitive (MCF7N and MCF7L) and two resistant MCF7 cell lines (MMU2
  and LCC9) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) oligonucleotide microarrays.
  DNA from MCF7(L) and MMU2 cells was also analysed by comparative genome hybridisation
  (CGH) to compare with SNP microarray data. Proteins previously determined to be
  involved in disease progression were quantified by Western blot and compared to
  array data. The SNP and CGH array both detected cytogenetic abnormalities commonly
  found in breast cancer: amplification of chromosomes 11q13-14.1, 17q and 20q containing
  cyclin D1, BCAS1 and 3 (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence) and AIB1 (Amplified in
  Breast cancer) genes; losses at 6q, 9p and X chromosomes, which included ERalpha
  (Estrogen Receptor alpha) and p16 ( INK4A ) genes. However the SNP chip array data
  additionally identified regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) followed by duplication
  of the remaining allele-uniparental disomy (UPD). Good concordance between SNP arrays
  and CGH analyses was observed, however there was poor correlation between gene copy
  number and protein levels between the cell lines. There were reductions in ERalpha,
  cyclin D1 and p27 protein levels whilst p21 protein levels were elevated in antiestrogen
  resistant MCF7 cell lines. Although protein levels varied there was no difference
  in gene copy number. This study shows SNP and CGH array analysis are powerful tools
  for analysis of allelic imbalance in breast cancer. However, the antiestrogen resistant
  phenotype was likely to be due to changes in gene expression and protein degradation
  rather than in altered gene copy number.'
