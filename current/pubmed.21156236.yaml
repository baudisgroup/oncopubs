abstract: In a study population of 45 patients who were previously enrolled in an
  imatinib dose escalation trial, genome-wide screening for regions of genetic gains
  and losses was performed using array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . Early
  molecular response EMR , defined as amp gt 50 reduction in the ratio of BCR-ABL1
  to ABL1 within 6 months after dose escalation, was a major endpoint for analysis.
  After aCGH analysis, copy number change of four genes was investigated in 52 patients
  as a validation. Copy number gain in 16p11.2 was more frequently observed in patients
  with EMR than in patients who failed to achieve EMR P 0.034 . A tendency for increased
  copy number in 22q11.23 in patients without EMR and for decreased copy number in
  17q12 in patients with EMR was observed P 0.072 and P 0.070, respectively . For
  GSTT1, in 22q11.23, copy number gain was observed in patients without EMR P 0.035
  . GSTT1 copy number gain was related to short time to treatment failure TTFx in
  patients without BCR-ABL1 mutations P 0.007 . In multivariate analysis, GSTT1 copy
  number gain was an independent predictive factor for short TTFx P 0.020 . We conclude
  that chromosome regions 16p11.2, 22q11.23, and 17q12 are potential locations related
  to response in imatinib dose escalation therapy for CML. GSTT1 copy number gain
  is a genetic change affecting outcome in this setting.
