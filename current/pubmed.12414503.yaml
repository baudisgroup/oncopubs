abstract: Several lines of evidence suggest that follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers
  represent a continuum of disease that progresses from the highly curable well-differentiated
  thyroid cancers to the universally fatal anaplastic cancers. However, the genetic
  mechanisms underlying thyroid cancer progression remain ill defined. We compared
  the molecular-cytogenetic profiles derived from comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis of major histological variants of thyroid cancer to define genetic
  variables associated with progression. Overall, a sequential increase in chromosomal
  complexity was observed from well-differentiated papillary thyroid cancer to poorly
  differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas, both in terms of the presence of CGH detectable
  abnormalities P 0.003 and the median number of abnormalities per case P amp lt 0.001
  . The presence of multiple abnormalities common to all thyroid cancer variants,
  including gains of 5p15, 5q11-13, 19p, and 19q and loss of 8p, suggests that these
  tumors are derived from a common genetic pathway. Gains of 1p34-36, 6p21, 9q34,
  17q25, and 20q and losses of 1p11-p31, 2q32-33, 4q11-13, 6q21, and 13q21-31 may
  represent secondary events in progression, as they were only detected in poorly
  differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas. Finally, recurrent gains at 3p13-14 and
  11q13, and loss of 5q11-31 were unique to anaplastic carcinomas, suggesting they
  may be markers for anaplastic transformation. Our data suggests that the development
  of chromosomal instability underlies the progression to more aggressive phenotypes
  of thyroid cancer and sheds light on the possible genomic aberrations that may be
  selected for during this process.
