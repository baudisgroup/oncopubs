abstract: We analysed 150 carcinomas of the respiratory tract and their metastases
  by Comparative Genomic Hybridization CGH , a screening method for the detection
  of chromosomal imbalances in solid tumors. Small cell lung carcinomas SCLC and non-small
  cell lung carcinomas NSCLC revealed characteristic patterns of chromosomal alterations
  with overlapping and specific lesions in both tumor groups. SCLC were defined by
  a pattern of deletions on chromosomes 3p, 4q, 5q, 10q, 13q and 17p along with overrepresentations
  of chromosomes 3q and 5p. In contrast, NSCLC carried frequently deletions on chromosomes
  1p, 3p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 13q, 18q and 21q along with overrepresentations of chromosomes
  5p and 11q13. The deletions of the chromosomal band 2q36-q37 together with amplifications
  of chromosome 3q were statistically significant lesions of squamous cell carcinomas
  SCC whereas adenocarcinomas were characterized in particular by the overrepresentation
  of chromosome 1q23 and the deletion on chromosome 9q22. The comparison of primary
  and metastatic tumors revealed that the deletion of chromosome 10q was a statistically
  significant marker of tumor progression and metastatic phenotype in SCC and SCLC.
  In conclusion, the data indicate that tumor histotypes and phenotypes are associated
  with patterns of chromosomal alterations which give important additional information
  for the classification of human lung carcinomas.
