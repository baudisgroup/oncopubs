abstract: Myeloproliferative neoplasms MPN include polycythemia vera PV , essential
  thrombocythemia ET , and primary myelofibrosis PMF . These disorders may undergo
  phenotypic shifts, and may specifically evolve into secondary myelofibrosis MF or
  acute myeloid leukemia AML . We studied genomic changes associated with these transformations
  in 29 patients who had serial samples collected in different phases of disease.
  Genomic DNA from granulocytes, i.e., the myeloproliferative genome, was processed
  and hybridized to genome-wide human SNP 6.0 arrays. Most patients in chronic phase
  had chromosomal regions with uniparental disomy UPD and or copy number changes.
  Disease progression to secondary MF or AML was associated with the acquisition of
  additional chromosomal aberrations in granulocytes P 0.002 . A close relationship
  was observed between aberrations of chromosome 9p UPD and or gain and progression
  from PV to post-PV MF P 0.002 . The acquisition of one or more aberrations involving
  chromosome 5, 7, or 17p was specifically associated with progression to AML OR 5.9,
  95 CI 1.2-27.7, P 0.006 , and significantly affected overall survival HR 18, 95
  CI 1.9-164, P 0.01 . These observations indicate that disease progression from chronic-phase
  MPN to secondary MF or AML is associated with specific chromosomal aberrations that
  can be detected by means of high-resolution SNP array analysis of granulocyte DNA.
