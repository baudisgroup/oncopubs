abstract: 'Purpose: Little is known about the molecular signatures associated with
  specific metastatic sites in breast cancer. Using comprehensive multi-omic molecular
  profiling, we assessed whether alterations or activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
  is associated with specific sites of breast cancer metastasis. <p>Experimental Design:
  NGS-based whole exome sequencing was coupled with Reverse Phase Protein Microarray
  (RPPA) functional signaling network analysis to explore the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis in
  32 pretreated breast cancer metastases. RPPA-based signaling data were further validated
  in an independent cohort of 154 metastatic lesions from breast cancer and 101 un-matched
  primary breast tumors. The proportion of cases with PI3K-AKT-mTOR genomic alterations
  or signaling network activation were compared between hepatic and non-hepatic lesions.</p>
  <p>Results:PIK3CA mutation and activation of AKT (S473) and p70S6K (T389) were detected
  more frequently among liver metastases than non-hepatic lesions (p<0.01, p=0.056,
  and p=0.053 respectively). However, PIK3CA mutations alone were insufficient in
  predicting protein activation (p=0.32 and p=0.19 for activated AKT and p70S6K respectively).
  RPPA analysis of an independent cohort of 154 tumors confirmed the relationship
  between pathway activation and hepatic metastasis (AKT (S473), mTOR (S2448), and
  4EBP1 (S65); p<0.01, p=0.02, and p=0.01 respectively). Similar results were also
  seen between liver metastases and primary breast tumors (AKT (S473) p<0.01, mTOR
  (S2448) p<0.01, 4EBP1 (S65) p=0.01). This signature was lost when primary tumors
  were compared to all metastatic sites combined.</p> <p>Conclusions: Breast cancer
  patients with liver metastasis may represent a molecularly homogenized cohort with
  increased incidence of PIK3CA mutations and activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
  network.'
