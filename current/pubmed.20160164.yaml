abstract: PAX5 is the main target of somatic mutations in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia
  B-ALL . We analyzed 153 adult and child B-ALL harboring karyotypic abnormalities
  at chromosome 9p, to determine the frequency and the nature of PAX5 alterations.
  We found PAX5 internal rearrangements in 21 of the cases. To isolate fusion partners,
  we used classic and innovative techniques rolling circle amplification-rapid amplification
  of cDNA ends and single nucleotide polymorphism-comparative genomic hybridization
  arrays. Recurrent and novel fusion partners were identified, including NCoR1, DACH2,
  GOLGA6, and TAOK1 genes showing the high variability of the partners. We noted that
  half the fusion genes can give rise to truncated PAX5 proteins. Furthermore, malignant
  cells carrying PAX5 fusion genes displayed a simple karyotype. These data strongly
  suggest that PAX5 fusion genes are early players in leukemogenesis. In addition,
  PAX5 deletion was observed in 60 of B-ALL with 9p alterations. Contrary to cases
  with PAX5 fusions, deletions were associated with complex karyotypes and common
  recurrent translocations. This supports the hypothesis of the secondary nature of
  the deletion. Our data shed more light on the high variability of PAX5 alterations
  in B-ALL. Therefore, it is probable that gene fusions occur early, whereas deletions
  should be regarded as a late secondary event.
