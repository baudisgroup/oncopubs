abstract: Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant paediatric brain tumour.
  The activation of the Wnt beta-catenin pathway occurs in 10-15 of medulloblastomas
  and has been recently described as a marker for favourable patient outcome. We report
  a series of 72 paediatric medulloblastomas evaluated for beta-catenin protein expression,
  CTNNB1 mutations, and comparative genomic hybridization. Gene expression profiles
  were also available in a subset of 40 cases. Immunostaining of beta-catenin showed
  extensive nuclear staining amp gt 50 of the tumour cells in six cases and focal
  nuclear staining amp lt 10 of cells in three cases. The other cases either exhibited
  a signal strictly limited to the cytoplasm 58 cases or were negative five cases
  . CTNNB1 mutations were detected in all beta-catenin extensively nucleopositive
  cases. The expression profiles of these cases documented strong activation of the
  Wnt beta-catenin pathway. Remarkably, five out of these six tumours showed a complete
  loss of chromosome 6. In contrast, cases with focal nuclear beta-catenin staining,
  as well as tumours with negative or cytoplasmic staining, never demonstrated CTNNB1
  mutation, Wnt beta-catenin pathway activation or chromosome 6 loss. Patients with
  extensive nuclear staining were significantly older at diagnosis and were in continuous
  complete remission after a mean follow-up of 75.7 months range 27.5-121.2 months
  from diagnosis. All three patients with focal nuclear staining of beta-catenin died
  within 36 months from diagnosis. Altogether, these data confirm and extend previous
  observations that CTNNB1-mutated tumours represent a distinct molecular subgroup
  of medulloblastomas with favourable outcome, indicating that therapy de-escalation
  should be considered. International consensus on the definition criteria of this
  distinct medulloblastoma subgroup should be achieved.
