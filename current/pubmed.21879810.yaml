abstract: Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a neoplasm of precursor B- or T-lymphocytes,
  and primary skin involvement is uncommon. The aim of the study was to review all
  reported primary cutaneous (PC)-LBLs and to examine three new cases to better characterize
  this neoplasm. Two of our patients showed a pre-B phenotype (PC-B-LBL) and one a
  never-reported pre-T phenotype (PC-T-LBL). The patient with PC-T-LBL showed an aggressive
  course, while those with PC-B-LBL showed a complete remission (CR) after polychemotherapy.
  Cytogenetic analysis and gene expression profiling (GEP) were performed on one case
  of PC-B-LBL and on that of PC-T-LBL. A specimen of PC-B-LBL and two specimens (early
  and late stage) of PC-T-LBL were investigated by microarray-based comparative genomic
  hybridization (CGH). All specimens revealed trisomy of chromosome 4. PC-T-LBL showed
  a gain of 1p36.33-p22.1 in the early stage and multiple chromosome gains/losses
  in the late stage. Our data suggest that trisomy 4 could be detected early in LBL
  and gain of 1p36.33-p22.1 could be an interesting marker in PC-T-LBL. LBL is an
  aggressive disease but, only in B-LBL, the cutaneous presentation seems to be a
  favorable prognostic factor and polychemotherapy is the best therapeutic approach.
  We suggest that PC-LBL should be included as a provisional clinicopathologic entity
  in future cutaneous lymphoma classification.
