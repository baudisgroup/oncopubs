abstract: 'We describe a case of leukemic mantle cell lymphoma MCL with complex karyotype
  and amplification of the CCND1 IGH fusion gene. Testing for the presence of t 11
  14 , the hallmark of MCL, revealed multiple copies of the fusion signals. We therefore
  conducted extensive molecular cytogenetic studies to delineate the nature and consequences
  of such an abnormality. We localized the amplification to the der 14 t 11 14 and
  to a der 2 chromosome in a form of interspersed chromosome 11 and 14 material. This
  resulted in high expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and the protein expressed independently
  of the cell cycle phase. CGH analysis revealed that the overrepresentation on chromosome
  11 included chromosomal band 11q23 in addition to the CCND1 locus at 11q13. The
  band 11q23 harbors the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM gene recently proposed
  to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCL with high incidence of deletions in this
  locus. Using YAC 801e11, containing the ATM gene, we demonstrated several hybridization
  signals, suggesting that this region also formed part of the amplicon. This case
  also showed TP53 gene abnormalities: protein expression, monoallelic deletion, and
  a mutation in exon 5. The clinical course was aggressive, and the patient died within
  6 months of presentation. This is to our knowledge the first description of amplification
  of the CCND1 IGH fusion gene in a human neoplasm, which may have played a role in
  the fulminating course of the disease in this patient.'
