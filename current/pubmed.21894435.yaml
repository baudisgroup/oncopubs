abstract: "We analyzed 10 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands
  by             array-based comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) using DNA chips
  spotted             with 4,030 bacterial artificial chromosome clones. After the
  data smoothing procedure             was applied, a total of 88 DNA copy number
  aberrations (DCNAs) were detected.             The frequent (â\x89¥30%) DCNAs were
  loss of 6q23-27 and 8p23, and gains of 6p, 6q23,             8p23 and 22q13. High-level
  gains were detected on 12q15, including MDM2 in two             cases. These two
  cases showed an immunohistochemically high-level (>50%) expression             of
  MDM2 and a low-level expression of p53 (<20%). Furthermore, the total number             of
  DCNAs was significantly greater in ACCs with loss of 6q compared to other ACCs,
  \            and in ACCs without the loss of 8p23 compared to other ACCs, respectively.
  Although             limitations exist, a-CGH detected several candidate chromosomal
  imbalances associated             with accumulation of DCNAs in ACCs."
