abstract: Apart from single reported aberrant karyotypes, genetic alterations in thymic
  epithelial neoplasms have not been investigated so far. In this study, 12 World
  Health Organization classification type A thymomas medullary thymomas , 16 type
  B3 thymomas well-differentiated thymic carcinomas , and nine type C thymomas, all
  of them primary thymic squamous cell carcinomas, were analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization. With the exception of one
  single case, type A thymomas did not reveal chromosomal gains or losses in comparative
  genomic hybridization. In contrast, all type B3 thymomas showed chromosomal imbalances,
  with gain of 1q, loss of chromosome 6, and loss of 13q occurring in 11 69 , six
  38 , and five 31 of 16 cases, respectively. In primary thymic squamous cell carcinoma,
  the most frequent chromosomal losses were observed for 16q six of nine cases, 67
  , 6 4 of 9, 44 , and 3p and 17p three of nine each, 33 , whereas recurrent gains
  of chromosomal material were gains of 1q 5 of 9, 56 , 17q, and 18 three of nine
  each, 33 . This study shows that the distinct histological thymoma types A and B3
  exhibit distinct genetic phenotypes, whereas type B3 thymoma and primary thymic
  squamous cell carcinoma partially share genetic aberrations. In addition to the
  possible tumorigenic role, the deletion in type B3 thymoma of chromosome 6, harboring
  the HLA locus, might play a role in the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic autoimmunity
  characteristic of thymoma.
