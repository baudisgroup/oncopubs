abstract: High-resolution comparative genomic hybridization HR-CGH analysis was performed
  on DNA purified from laser-capture microdissected carcinoma in situ CIS cells from
  nine cases of CIS, either from tissue without any invasive tumor or from testicular
  parenchyma adjacent to seminoma, nonseminoma, or a combined germ cell tumor. Before
  CGH analysis, DNA was amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR DOP-PCR
  and directly labeled with a mixture of FITC-dUTP and FITC-dCTP. CGH analysis revealed
  extra chromosome arm 12p material in six out of seven cases with CIS adjacent to
  overt tumors, but only a diminutive gain of 12q was noted in one of the two cases
  of CIS without invasive elements. In addition, gains of parts of chromosome 8 3
  7 and losses of chromosome 5 2 7 were demonstrated in CIS adjacent to invasive tumors.
  Gains of parts of chromosome 7 were found in CIS adjacent to seminoma 4 4 , whereas
  relative gains of chromosome 15 were identified in some cases of CIS adjacent to
  seminoma and in isolated CIS in comparison to CIS adjacent to nonseminoma. Our data
  seem to indicate that extra 12p material is not present in the amp quot dormant
  amp quot CIS cell before development of an invasive tumor. The gain of extra chromosome
  12 material may not be an early event in the neoplastic transformation, but is most
  likely associated with a more malignant progression of the CIS cell.
