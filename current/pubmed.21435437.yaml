abstract: Colorectal carcinomas CRC might be organized hierarchically and contain
  a subpopulation of tumorigenic, putative cancer stem cells that are CD133 positive.
  We studied the biological and genetic characteristics of such cells in CRC cell
  lines and primary tumors. Three CRC cell lines were sorted in CD133 positive and
  negative fractions. The respective genetic aberration profiles were studied using
  array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and expression profiling. Tumorigenicity
  for each cellular population was tested by injection into nude mice. Additionally,
  we compared CD133 and CD133- cells of 12 primary colorectal tumors using laser capture
  microdissection and aCGH. Three of five CRC cell lines displayed both CD133 and
  CD133- cells, but tumorigenicity of these subfractions did not differ significantly
  and aCGH revealed essentially identical genomic imbalances. However, 96 genes were
  differentially expressed between the two populations. Array comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis after laser capture microdissection of CD133 and CD133- areas
  in primary colorectal tumors revealed genetic differences in 7 of 12 cases. The
  use of cell lines for studying genomic alterations that define cancer stem cell
  characteristics, therefore, seems questionable. In contrast, CD133 cells in primary
  cancer samples showed a unique genomic aberration profile. In conclusion, our data
  suggest that CD133 positivity defines a genetically distinct cellular compartment
  in primary CRC, which potentially includes tumor initiating cells.
