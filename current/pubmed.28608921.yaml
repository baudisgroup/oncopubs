abstract: "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal cancers
  due to a high frequency of metastasis. However, little is known about the genomic
  landscape of metastatic ESCC. To identify the genetic alterations that underlie
  ESCC metastasis, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 41 primary tumors
  and 15 lymph nodes (LNs) with metastatic ESCC. Eleven cases included matched primary
  tumors, synchronous LN metastases and non-neoplastic mucosa. Approximately 50-76%
  of the mutations identified in primary tumors appeared in the synchronous LN metastases.
  Metastatic ESCC harbor frequent mutations of TP53, KMT2D, ZNF750, and IRF5. Importantly,
  ZNF750 was recurrently mutated in metastatic ESCC. Combined analysis from current
  and previous genomic ESCC studies indicated more frequent ZNF750 mutation occurred
  in diagnosed cases with LN metastasis than those without metastasis (14% vs. 3.4%,
  nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x89629, pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x891.78â\x80\x89Ã\x97â\x80\x8910-5) ).
  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data further showed that ZNF750 genetic alterations
  were associated with early disease relapse. Previous ESCC studies demonstrated that
  ZNF750 knockdown strongly promotes proliferation, migration and invasion. Collectively,
  these results suggest a role for ZNF750 as a metastasis suppressor. TP53 is highly
  mutated in ESCC and missense mutations are associated with poor overall survival,
  independent of pathological stage, suggesting these missense mutations have important
  functional impact for tumor progression, and are, thus, likely to be gain-of-function
  (GOF) mutations. Additionally, mutations of epigenetic regulators, including KMT2D,
  TET2 and KAT2A, and chromosomal 6p22 and 11q23 deletions of histone variants, important
  for nucleosome assembly, were detected in 80% of LN metastases. Our study highlights
  the important role of critical genetic events including ZNF750 mutations, TP53 putative
  GOF mutations and nucleosome disorganization caused by genetic lesions seen with
  ESCC metastasis."
