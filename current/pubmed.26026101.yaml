abstract: Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms.
  The exact genetic alterations underlying the pathophysiology of PEComas are largely
  unknown, although it has been shown that activation of the Mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role. Herein we describe the successful
  treatment of a patient with metastatic PEComa with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus
  and a comprehensive analysis to identify mechanisms for response.  Immunohistochemistry,
  array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and genetic analyses were performed.  Immunohistochemistry
  confirmed constitutive activation of mTOR. aCGH revealed a hyperdiploid karyotype
  affecting large regions of the genome. Next-generation sequencing did not reveal
  any tumor-specific mutations in mTOR-related genes.  Our results show the complexity
  of determining causal genetic alterations that can predict responsiveness to mTOR
  inhibition, even for a tumor with a complete remission to this specific treatment.  Copyrightï¿½
