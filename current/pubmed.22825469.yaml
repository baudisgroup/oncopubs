abstract: The molecular pathology of thymic epithelial tumors TETs is largely unknown.
  Using array comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we evaluated 59 TETs and identified
  recurrent patterns of copy number CN aberrations in different histotypes. GISTIC
  algorithm revealed the presence of 126 significant peaks of CN aberration, which
  included 13 cancer-related genes. Among these peaks, CN gain of BCL2 and CN loss
  of CDKN2A B were the only genes in the respective regions of CN aberration and were
  associated with poor outcome. TET cell lines were sensitive to siRNA knockdown of
  the anti-apoptotic molecules BCL2 and MCL1. Gx15-070, a pan-BCL2 inhibitor, induced
  autophagy-dependent necroptosis in TET cells via a mechanism involving mTOR pathways,
  and inhibited TET xenograft growth. ABT263, an inhibitor of BCL2 BCL-XL BCL-W, reduced
  proliferation in TET cells when administered in combination with sorafenib, a tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor able to downregulate MCL1. Immunohistochemistry on 132 TETs demonstrated
  that CN loss of CDKN2A correlated with lack of expression of its related protein
  p16 INK4 and identified tumors with poor prognosis. The molecular markers BCL2 and
  CDKN2A may be of potential value in diagnosis and prognosis of TETs. Our study provides
  the first preclinical evidence that deregulated anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins
  may represent suitable targets for TET treatment.
