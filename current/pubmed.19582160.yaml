abstract: Breast cancer cell lines have been used widely to investigate breast cancer
  pathobiology and new therapies. Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease,
  and it is important to understand how well and which cell lines best model that
  diversity. In particular, microarray studies have identified molecular subtypes-luminal
  A, luminal B, ERBB2-associated, basal-like and normal-like-with characteristic gene-expression
  patterns and underlying DNA copy number alterations CNAs . Here, we studied a collection
  of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation
  to breast cancer subtypes.
