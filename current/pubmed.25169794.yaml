abstract: Cell lines have been developed for modeling cancer and cancer progression.
  The molecular background of these cell lines is often unknown to those using them
  to model disease behaviors. As molecular alterations are the ultimate drivers of
  cell phenotypes, having an understanding of the molecular make-up of these systems
  is critical for understanding the disease biology modeled.Six immortalized normal,
  one immortalized dysplasia, one self-immortalized dysplasia, and two primary normal
  cell lines derived from oral tissues were analyzed for DNA copy number changes and
  changes in both mRNA and miRNA expression using SMRT-v.2 genome-wide tiling comparative
  genomic hybridization arrays, Agilent Whole Genome 4x44k expression arrays, and
  Exiqon V2.M-RT-PCR microRNA Human panels.DNA copy number alterations were detected
  in both normal and dysplastic immortalized cell lines-as well as in the single non-immortalized
  dysplastic cell line. These lines were found to have changes in expression of genes
  related to cell cycle control as well as alterations in miRNAs that are deregulated
  in clinical oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Immortal lines-whether normal
  or dysplastic-had increased disruption in expression relative to primary lines.
  All data are available as a public resource.Molecular profiling experiments have
  identified DNA, mRNA, and miRNA alterations for a panel of normal and dysplastic
  oral tissue cell lines. These data are a valuable resource to those modeling diseases
  of the oral mucosa, and give insight into the selection of model cell lines and
  the interpretation of data from those lines.
