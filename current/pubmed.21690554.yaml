abstract: Oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization CGH and gene-expression profiling
  of natural killer NK -cell neoplasms were used in an effort to delineate the molecular
  pathogenesis involved. Oligo-array CGH identified two 6q21 regions that were most
  frequently deleted 14 of 39 or 36 . One of these regions included POPDC3, PREP,
  PRDM1, ATG5, and AIM1, whereas the other included LACE1 and FOXO3. All genes located
  in these regions, except for POPDC3 and AIM1, were down-regulated in neoplastic
  samples, as determined by gene-expression analysis, and were therefore considered
  to be candidate tumor-suppressor genes. A20 and HACE1, the well-known tumor-suppressor
  genes located on 6q21-23, were included as candidate genes because they also demonstrated
  frequent genomic deletions and down-regulated expression. The Tet-Off NK cell line
  NKL was subsequently established for functional analyses. Seven candidate genes
  were transduced into Tet-Off NKL and forced re-expression was induced. Re-expression
  of FOXO3 and PRDM1 suppressed NKL proliferation, but this was not the case after
  re-expression of the other genes. This effect was confirmed using another NK cell
  line, SNK10. Furthermore, genomic analyses detected nonsense mutations of PRDM1
  that led to functional inactivation in one cell line and one clinical sample. PRDM1
  and FOXO3 are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NK-cell
  neoplasms.
