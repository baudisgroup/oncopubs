abstract: Microarray technologies provide high-resolution maps of chromosome imbalances
  and epigenomic aberrations in the cancer cell genome. Such assays are often sensitive
  to sample DNA integrity, voiding the utility of many archival pathology specimens
  and necessitating the special handling of prospective clinical specimens. We have
  identified the remarkable preservation of higher-molecular weight DNA in archival
  fine-needle aspiration cytopathology specimens from patients greater than 10 years
  of age. We further demonstrate the outstanding technical performance of 57 fine-needle
  aspiration cytopathology samples for aberration detection on high-resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization array, DNA methylation, and single nucleotide polymorphism
  genotyping platforms. Forty-four of 46 malignant aspirates in this study manifested
  unequivocal genomic aberrations. Importantly, matched Papanicolaou and Diff-Quik
  fine-needle aspiration cytopathology samples showed critical differences in DNA
  preservation and DNA integrity. Overall, this study identifies a largely untapped
  reserve of human pathology specimens for molecular profiling studies, with ramifications
  for the prospective collection of clinical biospecimens.
