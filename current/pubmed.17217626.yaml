abstract: The progression of organ-confined prostate cancer to metastatic cancer is
  inevitably fatal. Consequently, identification of structural changes in the genome
  and associated transcriptional responses that drive this progression is critical
  to understanding the disease process and the development of biomarkers and therapeutic
  targets. In this study, whole genome copy number changes in genomes of hormone-na
  ve lymph node metastases were profiled using array comparative genomic hybridization,
  and matched primaries were included for a subset. Matched primaries and lymph node
  metastases showed very similar copy number profiles that are distinct from primary
  tumors that fail to metastasize.
