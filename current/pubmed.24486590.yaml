abstract: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is associated with multiple
  somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs). We evaluated SCNAs to identify predictors
  of poor survival in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with platinum-based
  chemotherapy.We obtained overall survival (OS) and array DNA copy-number data from
  patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma in two cohorts. Associations between
  recurrent SCNAs and OS were determined by a Cox proportional hazard model adjusting
  for performance status and visceral disease. mRNA expression was evaluated for potential
  candidate genes by NanoString nCounter to identify transcripts from the region that
  are associated with copy-number gain. In addition, expression data from an independent
  cohort were used to identify candidate genes.Multiple areas of recurrent significant
  gains and losses were identified. Gain of 1q23.3 was independently associated with
  a shortened OS in both cohorts [adjusted HR, 2.96; 95% confidence interval (CI),
  1.35-6.48; P = 0.01 and adjusted HR, 5.03; 95% CI, 1.43-17.73; P < 0.001]. The F11R,
  PFDN2, PPOX, USP21, and DEDD genes, all located on 1q23.3, were closely associated
  with poor outcome.1q23.3 copy-number gain displayed association with poor survival
  in two cohorts of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The identification of the target
  of this copy-number gain is ongoing, and exploration of this finding in other disease
  states may be useful for the early identification of patients with poor-risk urothelial
  carcinoma. Prospective validation of the survival association is necessary to demonstrate
  clinical relevance.
