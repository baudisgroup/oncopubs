abstract: Although BRAF and MEK inhibitors have proven clinical benefits in melanoma,
  most patients develop resistance. We report a de novo MEK2-Q60P mutation and BRAF
  gain in a melanoma from a patient who progressed on the MEK inhibitor trametinib
  and did not respond to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. We also identified the same
  MEK2-Q60P mutation along with BRAF amplification in a xenograft tumor derived from
  a second melanoma patient resistant to the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib.
  Melanoma cells chronically exposed to trametinib acquired concurrent MEK2-Q60P mutation
  and BRAF-V600E amplification, which conferred resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors.
  The resistant cells had sustained MAPK activation and persistent phosphorylation
  of S6K. A triple combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
  GSK2126458 led to sustained tumor growth inhibition. Hence, concurrent genetic events
  that sustain MAPK signaling can underlie resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors,
  requiring novel therapeutic strategies to overcome it.
