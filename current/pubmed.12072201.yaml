abstract: Adenocarcinomas arising around the gastro-esophageal junction GEJ are highly
  malignant, and their incidence has risen rapidly in the last decades. Cell lines
  are the basic in vitro system for functional and therapeutic studies in GEJ tumors,
  but only a small number of cell lines are currently available, and none of them
  has been fully karyotyped. We analyzed 5 GEJ tumor cell lines using a combination
  of 24-color fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and genomic microarrays. Using CGH we demonstrated that these cell lines present
  imbalances similar to those we had previously observed in primary GEJ tumors, namely
  gains on 1q, 7q, 8q, 17q, 19q, 20, and X, and losses on 3p, 4, 5q, 9p, 18q, and
  21. Multicolor FISH karyotyping revealed multiple structural rearrangements involving
  chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 17, 18, and 22. Rearrangements of chromosome 8
  involved 10 different chromosomes, while rearrangements of chromosome 17 involved
  5. Different rearrangements resulted in imbalances of similar chromosome regions,
  suggesting that similar genomic imbalances are constitutively important but are
  achieved through different pathways. The use of a commercially available genomic
  array excluded TOP2A 17q , and MYBL2, PTPT1, CSE1L, and ZNF217 20q as candidate
  genes for frequently amplified areas on these chromosomes, and contributed to refining
  the limits of chromosome regions involved in genomic imbalances.
