abstract: INTRODUCTION:Arsenic exposure is a significant cause of lung cancer in North
  America and worldwide. Arsenic-related tumors are structurally indistinguishable
  from those induced by other carcinogens. Because carcinogens, like tobacco, induce
  distinctive mutational signatures, we sought to characterize the mutational signature
  of an arsenic-related lung tumor from a never smoker with the use of whole-genome
  sequencing.METHODS:Tumor and lung tissues were obtained from a never smoker with
  lung squamous cell carcinoma LUSC , without familiar history of lung cancer and
  chronically exposed to high levels of arsenic-contaminated drinking water. The Illumina
  HiSeq-2000 platform was used to sequence each genome at approximately 30-fold haploid
  coverage. The mutational signature was compared with those observed in previously
  characterized lung tumors.RESULTS:The arsenic-related tumor exhibited alterations
  common in LUSC, such as the increased number of copies at 3q26 SOX2 locus . However,
  the arsenic-related genome not only harbored a lower number of point mutations,
  but also had a remarkably high fraction of T gt G A gt C mutations and low fraction
  of C gt A G gt T transversions, which is uncharacteristic of LUSCs. Furthermore,
  at the gene level, we identified a rare G gt C mutation in TP53, which is uncommon
  in lung tumors in general lt 0.2 but has been observed in other arsenic-related
  malignancies.CONCLUSIONS:We generated the first whole-genome sequence of an LUSC
  from a never-smoker patient chronically exposed to arsenic, and identified a distinct
  mutational spectrum associated with arsenic exposure, providing novel evidence supporting
  the hypothesis that arsenic-induced lung tumors arise through molecular mechanisms
  that differ from those of the common lung cancer.
