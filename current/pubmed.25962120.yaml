abstract: Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination
  therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations
  in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting
  purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL)
  cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment,
  and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional
  analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving
  reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition
  of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol
  effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight
  the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway
  in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment
  of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.
