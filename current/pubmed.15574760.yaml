abstract: In this study, we performed high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
  with an array of 4153 bacterial artificial chromosome clones to assess copy number
  changes in 44 archival breast cancers. The tumors were flow sorted to exclude non-tumor
  DNA and increase our ability to detect gene copy number changes. In these tumors,
  losses were more frequent than gains, and gains in 1q and loss in 16q were the most
  frequent alterations. We compared gene copy number changes in the tumors based on
  histologic subtype and estrogen receptor ER status, i.e., ER-negative infiltrating
  ductal carcinoma, ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and ER-positive infiltrating
  lobular carcinoma. We observed a consistent association between loss in regions
  of 5q and ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma, as well as more frequent loss
  in 4p16, 8p23, 8p21, 10q25, and 17p11.2 in ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma
  compared with ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma adjusted P values amp lt
  or 0.05 . We also observed high-level amplifications in ER-negative infiltrating
  ductal carcinoma in regions of 8q24 and 17q12 encompassing the c-myc and c-erbB-2
  genes and apparent homozygous deletions in 3p21, 5q33, 8p23, 8p21, 9q34, 16q24,
  and 19q13. ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma showed a higher frequency of
  gain in 16p13 and loss in 16q21 than ER-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
  Correlation analysis highlighted regions of change commonly seen together in ER-negative
  infiltrating ductal carcinoma. ER-positive infiltrating lobular carcinoma differed
  from ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the frequency of gain in 1q and
  loss in 11q and showed high-level amplifications in 1q32, 8p23, 11q13, and 11q14.
  These results indicate that array comparative genomic hybridization can identify
  significant differences in the genomic alterations between subtypes of breast cancer.
