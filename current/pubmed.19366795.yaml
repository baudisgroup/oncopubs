abstract: Several phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K catalytic subunit inhibitors are
  currently in clinical trial. We therefore sought to examine relationships between
  pharmacologic inhibition and somatic mutations in PI3K catalytic subunits in estrogen
  receptor ER -positive breast cancer, in which these mutations are particularly common.
  RNA interference RNAi was used to determine the effect of selective inhibition of
  PI3K catalytic subunits, p110alpha and p110beta, in ER breast cancer cells harboring
  either mutation PIK3CA or gene amplification PIK3CB . p110alpha RNAi inhibited growth
  and promoted apoptosis in all tested ER breast cancer cells under estrogen deprived-conditions,
  whereas p110beta RNAi only affected cells harboring PIK3CB amplification. Moreover,
  dual p110alpha p110beta inhibition potentiated these effects. In addition, treatment
  with the clinical-grade PI3K catalytic subunit inhibitor BEZ235 also promoted apoptosis
  in ER breast cancer cells. Importantly, estradiol suppressed apoptosis induced by
  both gene knockdowns and BEZ235 treatment. Our results suggest that PI3K inhibitors
  should target both p110alpha and p110beta catalytic subunits, whether wild-type
  or mutant, and be combined with endocrine therapy for maximal efficacy when treating
  ER breast cancer.
