abstract: Homozygous deletions HD provide an important resource for identifying the
  location of candidate tumor suppressor genes. To identify the tumor suppressor gene
  in oral cancer, we employed high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  -array analysis. We identified a homozygous loss of FAT 4q35 , a new member of the
  human cadherin superfamily, from genome-wide screening of copy number alterations
  in one primary oral cancer. This result was evaluated by genomic polymerase chain
  reaction in 13 oral cancer cell lines and 20 primary oral cancers and Southern blot
  in the cell lines. We found frequent exonic HD of FAT in the cell lines 3 13, 23
  and in primary oral cancers 16 20, 80 . FAT expression was absent in these cell
  lines. Homozygous deletion hot spots were observed in exon 1 9 20, 45 and exon 4
  7 20, 35 . Moreover, loss of gene expression was identified in other types of squamous
  cell carcinoma. The methylation status of the FAT CpG island in squamous cell carcinomas
  correlated negatively with its expression. Our results identify mutations in FAT
  as an important factor in the development of oral cancer and indicate the importance
  of FATs function in some squamous cell carcinomas.
