abstract: Neck lymphatic metastasis represents the single most important clinical
  prognostic factor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC , but underlying genetic mechanisms
  remain ill defined. In this study 23 samples of primary tumor PT and 9 of neck lymph
  node metastasis NLNM obtained from NPC patients were analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH coupled with tissue microdissection and degenerate oligonucleotide
  primer-polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR . A similar pattern of chromosomal abnormalities
  was seen in PT and NLNM, the common aberrations were gains on 5p, 12p, 12q and 18p
  and deletions on 1p, 3p, 9q, 14q, 17p and 16q. However, NLNMs, but not PTs, also
  exhibited frequent losses on 9p, 16p, 17q, 20q, 21p, 21q and 22q and gains on 8q
  and 8p. The most frequent unique aberration in NLNMs was loss on 16p, observed in
  100 9 9 NLNMs tested, as well as loss of 20q, observed in 77.8 of tumors tested.
  For the first time, we report that a gain on 8p and a loss at 20q is common to NLNMs.
  The analysis furthermore suggests that specific alterations, e.g. losses of 9p,
  16p, 7q, 20q, 21p, 21q, 22q and gains on 8q and 8p are associated with NLNM of NPC,
  and that these alterations may be involved in the onset and or progression of a
  metastatic phenotype.
