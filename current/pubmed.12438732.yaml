abstract: Supernumerary ring chromosomes and or giant marker chromosomes are often
  seen in soft-tissue tumors of low-grade or borderline malignancy, such as well-differentiated
  liposarcomas or atypical lipomas. Classic cytogenetic banding techniques have proved
  insufficient to identify the genomic composition and structure of such rings and
  markers, but fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH studies have shown that they
  consist mainly of amplified material from chromosome 12, more specifically from
  bands 12q13-- amp gt q15. We have used the new FISH-based screening techniques comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and multicolor-FISH M-FISH in combination with G-banding
  and analysis by chromosome- and locus-specific fluorescent in situ probes to examine
  in detail the karyotypic characteristics of 22 lipomatous tumors, most of them classified
  histologically as well-differentiated liposarcomas, selected because they had been
  shown to harbor rings and or marker chromosomes. M-FISH, in contrast to G- banding,
  was found to be informative with regard to the chromosomal origin of the rings and
  other markers present, whereas CGH and hybridizations with locus-specific probes
  helped identify which subchromosomal regions were involved. We found that chromosome
  bands 12q15-- amp gt q21 were always gained, with 12q15-- amp gt q21 being amplified
  i.e., a green-to-red ratio amp gt 2 by CGH in 14 of 22 tumors. In three tumors,
  two distinct but close amplicons in 12q could be identified, corresponding to bands
  12q13-- amp gt q15 and 12q21. The genomic segment 1q21-- amp gt q23 was gained in
  12 cases, reaching the level of amplification in seven. Bands 6q24 and 7p15, whose
  pathogenetic involvement in liposarcomas has not been reported previously, were
  gained in three cases each. In addition, the rings and giant markers often contained
  interspersed sequences from several other chromosomes that did not give an equally
  clear impression of being nonrandomly involved.
