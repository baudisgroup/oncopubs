abstract: To account for the accumulation of genomic alterations required for tumor
  progression, it has been suggested that the genomes of cancer cells are unstable
  and that this instability results from defective mutators the amp quot mutator phenotype
  amp quot theory . To examine the hypothesis that abnormal cell-cycle regulators
  act as the mutators contributing to genomic instability, the present study, based
  on primary tumor tissues from 71 patients with breast cancer, was performed to determine
  whether there was an association between aberrant expression of cell-cycle regulators
  cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, RB1, p21, and p27 and chromosomal instability. Comparative
  genomic hybridization was used to measure chromosomal changes, reflecting genomic
  instability in individual tumors, whereas immunohistochemistry was used to detect
  aberrant expression of cell-cycle regulators. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was found
  to be significantly correlated with increased chromosomal instability defined as
  harboring more than 7 chromosomal changes , with 63 of tumors overexpressing and
  27 of tumors not overexpressing, with cyclin D1 showing chromosomal instability
  P amp lt 0.05 . Interestingly, this relationship was independent of cell outgrowth
  as detected by the proliferation marker Ki-67 and was particularly significant in
  tumors not expressing p27 or in tumors with detectable RB1. These results suggest
  that cyclin D1 plays an alternative role in the regulation of genomic stability.
