abstract: Clinical correlative studies have linked 1p36 deletions with worse prognosis
  in follicular lymphoma FL . In this study, we sought to identify the critical gene
  s in this region that is responsible for conferring inferior prognosis. BAC array
  technology applied to 141 FL specimens detected a minimum region of deletion MRD
  of 97 kb within 1p36.32 in 20 of these cases. Frequent single-nucleotide polymorphism-detected
  copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity was also found in this region. Analysis of promoter
  CpGs in the MRD did not reveal differential patterns of DNA methylation in samples
  that differed in 1p36 status. Exon sequencing of MRD genes identified somatic alterations
  in the TNFRSF14 gene in 3 of 11 selected cases with matching normal DNA. An expanded
  cohort consisting of 251 specimens identified 46 cases 18.3 with nonsynonymous mutations
  affecting TNFRSF14. Overall survival OS and disease-specific survival DSS were associated
  with the presence of TNFRSF14 mutation in patients whose overall treatment included
  rituximab. We further showed that inferior OS and DSS were most pronounced in patients
  whose lymphomas contained both TNFRSF14 mutations and 1p36 deletions after adjustment
  for the International Prognostic Index hazard ratios of 3.65 95 confidence interval,
  1.35-9.878, P 0.011 and 3.19 95 confidence interval, 1.06-9.57, P 0.039 , respectively
  . Our findings identify TNFRSF14 as a candidate gene associated with a subset of
  FL, based on frequent occurrence of acquired mutations and their correlation with
  inferior clinical outcomes.
