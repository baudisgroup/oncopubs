abstract: Soft tissue sarcomas are a diverse set of fatal human tumors where few agents
  have demonstrable clinical efficacy, with the standard therapeutic combination of
  doxorubicin and ifosfamide showing only a 25 to 30 response rate in large multi-institutional
  trials. Although liposarcomas are the most common histologic form of adult soft
  tissue sarcomas, research in this area is severely hampered by the lack of experimentally
  tractable in vitro model systems. To this end, here we describe a novel in vitro
  model for human pleomorphic liposarcoma. The cell line LS2 is derived from a pleomorphic
  liposarcoma that uses the alternative lengthening of telomeres ALT mechanism of
  telomere maintenance, which may be important in modulating the response of this
  tumor type to DNA-damaging agents. We present detailed baseline molecular and genomic
  data, including genome-wide copy number and transcriptome profiles, for this model
  compared with its parental tumor and a panel of liposarcomas covering multiple histologies.
  The model has retained essentially all of the detectable alterations in copy number
  that are seen in the parental tumor, and shows molecular karyotypic and expression
  profiles consistent with pleomorphic liposarcomas. We also show the utility of this
  model, together with two additional human liposarcoma cell lines, to investigate
  the relationship between topoisomerase 2A expression and the sensitivity of ALT-positive
  liposarcomas to doxorubicin. This model, together with its associated baseline data,
  provides a powerful new tool to develop treatments for this clinically poorly tractable
  tumor and to investigate the contribution that ALT makes to modulating sensitivity
  to doxorubicin.
