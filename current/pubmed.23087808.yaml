abstract: "More than 50% of myeloma cases have normal karyotypes under conventional
  cytogenetic analysis due to low mitotic activity and content of plasma cells in
  the bone marrow. We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based translocation detection
  assay to detect BCL1/JH t(11;14) (q13;q32) in 105 myeloma patients, and randomly
  selected 8 translocation positive samples for array comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) analysis. Our findings revealed 14.3% of myeloma samples were positive for
  BCL1/JH t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation (n=15 of 105). We found no significant
  correlation between this translocation with age (P=0.420), gender (P=0.317), ethnicity
  (P=0.066) or new/relapsed status of multiple myeloma (P=0.412) at 95% confidence
  interval level by √è\x87(2)test. In addition, aCGH results showed genomic imbalances
  in all samples analyzed. Frequent chromosomal gains were identified at regions 1q,
  2q, 3p, 3q, 4p, 4q, 5q, 7q, 9q, 11q, 13q, 15q, 21q, 22q and Xq, while chromosomal
  losses were detected at 4q and 14q. Copy number variations at genetic loci that
  contain NAMPT, IVNS1ABP and STK17B genes are new findings that have not previously
  been reported in myeloma patients. Besides fluorescence in situ hybridization, PCR
  is another rapid, sensitive and simple technique that can be used for detecting
  BCL1/JH t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in multiple myeloma patients. Genes located
  in the chromosomal aberration regions in our study, such as NAMPT, IVNS1ABP, IRF2BP2,
  PICALM, STAT1, STK17B, FBXL5, ACSL1, LAMP2, SAMSN1 and ATP8B4 might be potential
  prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in the treatment and management of multiple
  myeloma patients positive for BCL1/JH t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation."
