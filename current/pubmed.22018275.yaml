abstract: 'Among patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML , the rare group of complex
  aberrant karyotypes characterized by high hyperdiploidy HH is a subset with poor
  prognosis. Because of their rarity, few conventional cytogenetic studies have specifically
  addressed these patients. To identify DNA copy number aberrations at the submicroscopic
  level, we applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to samples
  from 19 AML patients with complex karyotypes characterized by HH  49 chromosomes
  . We found a total of 155 imbalances average: 8.2 per patient , and a high proportion
  of these imbalances involved whole chromosomes n 75 . The chromosomes most commonly
  gained were chromosomes 8 58 , 21 42 , and 19 32 . We identified 80 segmental genomic
  aberrations, and losses n 47 were more frequent than gains n 33 . We identified
  common deleted regions at 5q, 15q, 18p, and 19p. The tumor suppressor gene L3MBTL4
  and zinc finger proteins reside within 18p and 19p, respectively. The aCGH analysis
  added new information to the karyotypic interpretations in 16 of the 19 HH AML cases
  84 , leading to a significantly higher detection rate of abnormalities.'
