abstract: In a previous study that used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to analyze
  43 ductal breast carcinomas selected for hyperdiploidy, we proposed the existence
  of two distinct pathways of chromosomal evolution. In the present study, in which
  we reassessed our cytogenetic findings on 158 ductal breast carcinomas selected
  for having a modal number of chromosomes of fewer than 60, we confirmed the existence
  of two subtypes of tumors. Along with the great majority of tumors 142 of 158 that
  evolved through structural rearrangements with no or very few whole-chromosome gains,
  we found that a minor subset 16 of 158 evolved through progressive gains of whole
  chromosomes with no or only a few associated rearrangements. In this article, we
  describe the karyotypes of these 16 tumors together with data from CGH, which was
  performed for 10 of them. Chromosomes 5, 7, 8, and 20 were the most frequently gained.
  Our findings support the evidence of a new pathway of chromosomal evolution in a
  small subset of ductal breast carcinomas characterized by numerical chromosome aberrations.
