abstract: Soft tissue sarcoma STS diagnostics and prognostics are challenging, particularly
  in highly malignant and pleomorphic subtypes such as undifferentiated pleomorphic
  sarcoma UPS and leiomyosarcoma LMS . We applied 32K BAC arrays and gene expression
  profiling to 18 extremity soft tissue LMS and 31 extremity soft tissue UPS with
  the aim of identifying molecular subtype signatures and genomic prognostic markers.
  Both the gains losses and gene expression signatures revealed striking similarities
  between UPS and LMS, which were indistinguishable using unsupervised hierarchical
  cluster analysis and significance analysis for microarrays. Gene expression analysis
  revealed just nine genes, among them tropomyosin beta, which were differentially
  expressed. Loss of 4q31 encompassing the SMAD1 locus , loss of 18q22, and tumor
  necrosis were identified as independent predictors of metastasis in multivariate
  stepwise Cox regression analysis. Combined analysis applying loss of 4q31 and 18q22
  and the presence of necrosis improved the area under receiver operating characteristic
  curve for metastasis prediction from 0.64 to 0.86. The extensive genetic similarities
  between extremity soft tissue UPS and LMS suggest a shared lineage of these STS
  subtypes and the new and independent genetic prognosticators identified hold promise
  for refined prognostic determination in high-grade, genetically complex STS.
