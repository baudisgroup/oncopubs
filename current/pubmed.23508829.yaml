abstract: Near haploidy 23-29 chromosomes is a numerical cytogenetic aberration in
  childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL associated with particularly poor outcome.
  In contrast, high hyperdiploidy 51-67 chromosomes has a favorable prognosis. Correct
  classification and appropriate risk stratification of near haploidy is frequently
  hampered by the presence of apparently high hyperdiploid clones that arise by endoreduplication
  of the original near haploid clone. We evaluated next-generation-sequencing NGS
  to distinguish between quot high hyperdiploid quot leukemic clones of near haploid
  and true high hyperdiploid origin. Five high hyperdiploid ALL cases and the quot
  high hyperdiploid quot cell line MHH-CALL-2, derived from a near haploid clone,
  were tested for uniparental isodisomy. NGS showed that all disomic chromosomes of
  MHH-CALL-2, but none of the patients, were of uniparental origin, thus reliably
  discriminating these subtypes. Whole-exome- and whole-genome-sequencing of MHH-CALL-2
  revealed homozygous non-synonymous coding mutations predicted to be deleterious
  for the protein function of 63 genes, among them known cancer-associated genes,
  such as FANCA, NF1, TCF7L2, CARD11, EP400, histone demethylases, and transferases
  KDM6B, KDM1A, PRDM11 . Only eight of these were also, but heterozygously, mutated
  in the high hyperdiploid patients. Structural variations in MHH-CALL-2 include a
  homozygous deletion MTAP CDKN2A CDKN2B ANRIL , a homozygous inversion NCKAP5 , and
  an unbalanced translocation FAM189A1 . Together, the sequence variations provide
  MHH-CALL-2 with capabilities typically acquired during cancer development, e.g.,
  loss of cell cycle control, enhanced proliferation, lack of DNA repair, cell death
  evasion, and disturbance of epigenetic gene regulation. Poorer prognosis of near
  haploid ALL most likely results from full penetrance of a large array of detrimental
  homozygous mutations
