abstract: To search for disease-related copy number variations CNVs in families with
  a high frequency of germ cell tumours GCT , we analysed 16 individuals from four
  families by array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and applied an integrative
  systems biology algorithm that prioritizes risk-associated genes among loci targeted
  by CNVs. The top-ranked candidate, RLN1, encoding a Relaxin-H1 peptide, although
  only detected in one of the families, was selected for further investigations. Validation
  of the CNV at the RLN1 locus was performed as an association study using qPCR with
  106 sporadic testicular GCT patients and 200 healthy controls. Observed CNV frequencies
  of 1.9 among cases and 1.5 amongst controls were not significantly different and
  this was further confirmed by CNV data extracted from a genome-wide analysis of
  189 cases and 380 controls, where similar frequencies of 2.2 were observed in both
  groups p 1 . Immunohistochemistry for Relaxin-H1 RLN1 , Relaxin-H2 RLN2 and their
  cognate receptor, RXFP1, detected one, and in some cases both, of the relaxins in
  Leydig cells, Sertoli cells and a subset of neoplastic germ cells, whereas the receptor
  was present in Leydig cells and spermatids. Collectively, the findings show that
  a heterozygous loss at the RLN1 locus is not a genetic factor mediating high population-wide
  risk for testicular germ cell tumour, but do not exclude a contribution of this
  aberration in some cases of cancer. The preliminary expression data suggest a possible
  role of the relaxin peptides in spermatogenesis and warrant further studies.
