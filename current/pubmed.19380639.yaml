abstract: Proliferation and survival of Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg HRS cells, the
  malignant cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma cHL , are dependent on constitutive
  activation of nuclear factor kappaB NF-kappaB . NF-kappaB activation through various
  stimuli is negatively regulated by the zinc finger protein A20. To determine whether
  A20 contributes to the pathogenesis of cHL, we sequenced TNFAIP3, encoding A20,
  in HL cell lines and laser-microdissected HRS cells from cHL biopsies. We detected
  somatic mutations in 16 out of 36 cHLs 44 , including missense mutations in 2 out
  of 16 Epstein-Barr virus-positive EBV  cHLs and a missense mutation, nonsense mutations,
  and frameshift-causing insertions or deletions in 14 out of 20 EBV - cHLs. In most
  mutated cases, both TNFAIP3 alleles were inactivated, including frequent chromosomal
  deletions of TNFAIP3. Reconstitution of wild-type TNFAIP3 in A20-deficient cHL cell
  lines revealed a significant decrease in transcripts of selected NF-kappaB target
  genes and caused cytotoxicity. Extending the mutation analysis to primary mediastinal
  B cell lymphoma PMBL , another lymphoma with constitutive NF-kappaB activity, revealed
  destructive mutations in 5 out of 14 PMBLs 36 . This report identifies TNFAIP3 A20
  , a key regulator of NF-kappaB activity, as a novel tumor suppressor gene in cHL
  and PMBL. The significantly higher frequency of TNFAIP3 mutations in EBV - than
  EBV cHL suggests complementing functions of TNFAIP3 inactivation and EBV infection
  in cHL pathogenesis.
