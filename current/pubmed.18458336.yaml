abstract: We present here a genome-wide map of abnormalities found in diagnostic samples
  from 45 adults and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . A 500K SNP
  array analysis uncovered frequent genetic abnormalities, with cryptic deletions
  constituting half of the detected changes, implying that microdeletions are a characteristic
  feature of this malignancy. Importantly, the pattern of deletions resembled that
  recently reported in pediatric ALL, suggesting that adult, adolescent, and childhood
  cases may be more similar on the genetic level than previously thought. Thus, 70
  of the cases displayed deletion of one or more of the CDKN2A, PAX5, IKZF1, ETV6,
  RB1, and EBF1 genes. Furthermore, several genes not previously implicated in the
  pathogenesis of ALL were identified as possible recurrent targets of deletion. In
  total, the SNP array analysis identified 367 genetic abnormalities not corresponding
  to known copy number polymorphisms, with all but two cases 96 displaying at least
  one cryptic change. The resolution level of this SNP array study is the highest
  used to date to investigate a malignant hematologic disorder. Our findings provide
  insights into the leukemogenic process and may be clinically important in adult
  and adolescent ALL. Most importantly, we report that microdeletions of key genes
  appear to be a common, characteristic feature of ALL that is shared among different
  clinical, morphological, and cytogenetic subgroups.
