abstract: Osteosarcoma is a rare but highly malignant cancer of the bone. As a consequence,
  the number of established cell lines used for experimental in vitro and in vivo
  osteosarcoma research is limited and the value of these cell lines relies on their
  stability during culture. Here we investigated the stability in gene expression
  by microarray analysis and array genomic hybridization of three low metastatic cell
  lines and derivatives thereof with increased metastatic potential using cells of
  different passages.  The osteosarcoma cell lines showed altered gene expression
  during in vitro culture, and it was more pronounced in two metastatic cell lines
  compared to the respective parental cells. Chromosomal instability contributed in
  part to the altered gene expression in SAOS and LM5 cells with low and high metastatic
  potential. To identify metastasis-relevant genes in a background of passage-dependent
  altered gene expression, genes involved in "Pathways in cancer" that were consistently
  regulated under all passage comparisons were evaluated. Genes belonging to "Hedgehog
  signaling pathway" and "Wnt signaling pathway" were significantly up-regulated,
  and IHH, WNT10B and TCF7 were found up-regulated in all three metastatic compared
  to the parental cell lines.  Considerable instability during culture in terms of
  gene expression and chromosomal aberrations was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines.
  The use of cells from different passages and a search for genes consistently regulated
  in early and late passages allows the analysis of metastasis-relevant genes despite
  the observed instability in gene expression in osteosarcoma cell lines during culture.
