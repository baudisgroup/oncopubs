abstract: Primary cutaneous CD30 anaplastic large cell lymphoma C-ALCL represents
  a distinct clinical subtype of CD30 anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The etiology
  and underlying molecular pathogenesis of C-ALCL remain unclear. This study aimed
  to investigate genetic changes in C-ALCL. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  analysis of 23 DNA samples from 15 C-ALCL cases identified chromosome imbalances
  CI in 10 samples from eight cases 43 . The mean number of CI per sample was 2.09
  - 3.86, with gains 2.00 - 3.85 more common than losses 0.09 - 0.29 . The most frequent
  CI were gains of 1 1p and 5 50 and 6, 7, 8 8p, and 19 38 . Microarray-based CGH
  analysis of six DNA samples from five cases with CI revealed genomic imbalances
  GI in all of the cases studied. This included oncogene copy number gains of FGFR1
  8p11 in three cases, and NRAS 1p13.2 , MYCN 2p24.1 , RAF1 3p25 , CTSB 8p22 , FES
  15q26.1 , and CBFA2 21q22.3 in two cases. Real-time PCR analysis of nine DNA samples
  from eight cases with CI and GI detected amplifications of CTSB and RAF1 in seven
  cases 88 , REL 2p13p12 and JUNB 19p13.2 in six cases 75 , and MYCN and YES1 18p11.3
  in four cases 50 . Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections from six cases
  demonstrated expression of JUNB protein in five cases and BCL2 in three cases. These
  results reveal a consistent pattern of genetic alterations in C-ALCL and provide
  the molecular basis for further investigation of this disease.
