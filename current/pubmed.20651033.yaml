abstract: To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind esophageal adenocarcinoma
  EAC tumorigenesis, we used high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to
  profile chromosomal aberrations at each of the four sequential progression stages,
  Barretts metaplasia BM , low-grade dysplasia LGD , high-grade dysplasia HGD , and
  EAC, in 101 patients. We observed a significant trend toward increasing loss of
  chromosomes with higher progression stage. For BM, LGD, HGD, and EAC, respectively,
  the average numbers of chromosome arms with loss per sample were 0.30, 3.21, 7.70,
  and 11.90 P for trend 4.82 x 10 -7 , and the mean percentages of single nucleotide
  polymorphisms with allele loss were 0.1 , 1.8 , 6.6 , and 17.2 P for trend 2.64
  x 10 -6 . In LGD, loss of 3p14.2 68.4 and 16q23.1 47.4 was limited to narrow regions
  within the FHIT 3p14.2 and WWOX 16q23.1 genes, whereas loss of 9p21 68.4 occurred
  in larger regions. A significant increase in the loss of other chromosomal regions
  was seen in HGD and EAC. Loss of 17p 47.6 was one of the most frequent events in
  EAC. Many recurrent small regions of chromosomal loss disrupted single genes, including
  FHIT, WWOX, RUNX1, KIF26B, MGC48628, PDE4D, C20orf133, GMDS, DMD, and PARK2, most
  of which are common fragile site regions in the human genome. However, RUNX1 at
  21q22 seemed to be a potential tumor suppressor gene in EAC. Amplifications were
  less frequent than losses and mostly occurred in EAC. 8q24 containing Myc and 8p23.1
  containing CTSB were the two most frequently amplified regions. In addition, a significant
  trend toward increasing amplification was associated with higher progression stage.
