abstract: We screened 18 specimens of Barrett adenocarcinoma for genetic alterations
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH to analyze DNA copy number changes.
  The most common gains were at 20q 56 and 17q 39 . High-level amplifications were
  observed in the same chromosomes. The most common losses were in chromosomes 4 22
  and 5 22 . Other recurrent changes were gains of chromosomes 8, 10q, and 13. We
  compared the copy number changes in Barrett adenocarcinoma and those previously
  reported in the intestinal type of stomach carcinoma. The similarities we found
  suggest a common molecular pathogenesis, whereas dissimilarities seen between Barrett
  adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are in keeping with a well-known
  different etiology.
