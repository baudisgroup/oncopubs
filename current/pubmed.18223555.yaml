abstract: Genetic changes in the tumorigenesis of sporadic pheochromocytomas are poorly
  understood, and there are no good markers to discriminate benign from malignant
  pheochromocytomas. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene and aberrations in this gene are
  frequently found in many tumor types. The role of p53 in pheochromocytoma tumorigenesis
  is unclear, with some studies suggesting that p53 mutations can be used to discriminate
  benign from malignant pheochromocytomas while other studies do not find such an
  association. Because most of these investigations were hampered by small series
  of tumors and the use of varying methods, we have performed a comprehensive analysis
  of p53 aberrations in a large series of pheochromocytomas. Comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis of 31 benign and 20 malignant tumors showed loss of the p53 locus at chromosome
  17p13.1 in 23 51 45 cases, and most of these results were confirmed by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. Forty-three tumors, including the malignant tumors and the
  tumors with loss of the p53 locus, were analyzed for p53 mutations in exons 5-8,
  but none were found. Furthermore, p53 immunohistochemistry on 35 cases revealed
  strong nuclear p53 expression in only two pheochromocytoma metastases, all other
  tumors being negative. We conclude that, although there is frequent loss of the
  p53 locus on 17p, the p53 gene does not appear to play a major role in pheochromocytoma
  tumorigenesis.
