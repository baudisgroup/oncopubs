abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC is one of the most common cancers in Malaysia,
  mainly occurring among the Chinese population. To detect common genetic alterations
  in NPC, we screened seven cases of NPC using the comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH technique. Before proceeding to the CGH technique, the tumors were first confirmed
  to consist of 75 tumor cells or more. In brief, the technique consists of binding
  tumor DNA with normal DNA and human Cot-1 DNA, which is then hybridized to normal
  metaphase spreads. The slides were then counterstained with 4,6 diamino-2-phenylindole
  DAPI II for detection. Analyses were performed using CGH software Cytovision . We
  found genetic alterations in all seven NPC samples. The common chromosomal gains
  57 , four cases were found on chromosome arms 1q, 4p, 5, 7q, 11, 14p, 15q, 18p,
  and 21p, and common chromosomal losses 43 , three cases were found on chromosome
  arm 16p. Our results showed chromosomal alterations in all seven NPC cases in the
  Malaysian population. This result provides the platform for further investigations
  to locate tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes at specific chromosomal regions in
  Malaysian NPC patients.
