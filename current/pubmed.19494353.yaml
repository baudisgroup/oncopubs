abstract: The molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression and relapse in
  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL are poorly understood. We used single
  nucleotide polymorphism array analysis to analyze paired diagnostic and relapsed
  T-ALL samples to identify recurrent genetic alterations in T-ALL. This analysis
  showed that diagnosis and relapsed cases have common genetic alterations, but also
  that relapsed samples frequently lose chromosomal markers present at diagnosis,
  suggesting that relapsed T-ALL emerges from an ancestral clone different from the
  major leukemic population at diagnosis. In addition, we identified deletions and
  associated mutations in the WT1 tumor suppressor gene in 2 of 9 samples. Subsequent
  analysis showed WT1 mutations in 28 of 211 13.2 of pediatric and 10 of 85 11.7 of
  adult T-ALL cases. WT1 mutations present in T-ALL are predominantly heterozygous
  frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminal zinc finger domains
  of this transcription factor. WT1 mutations are most prominently found in T-ALL
  cases with aberrant rearrangements of the oncogenic TLX1, TLX3, and HOXA transcription
  factor oncogenes. Survival analysis demonstrated that WT1 mutations do not confer
  adverse prognosis in pediatric and adult T-ALL. Overall, these results identify
  the presence of WT1 mutations as a recurrent genetic alteration in T-ALL.
