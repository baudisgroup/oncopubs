abstract: 'Intratumoral regional variations in the copy number of chromosomal material
  were analyzed to demonstrate the time sequence of chromosomal changes in progression
  of individual squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. We applied combined DNA
  ploidy and comparative genomic hybridization CGH analyses to multiple DNA samples
  extracted from microdissected, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, and amplified
  and labeled according to degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction.
  We examined two cases: one with a deep invasive tumor and the other with a superficial
  spreading tumor. We found that each sample had unique aberrations in addition to
  the ones common to all or some of the samples in a tumor. Based on previous studies
  Okada et al., Cancer Genet Cytogenet 2000 118:99-107 , we classified significant
  shifts of the green to red G R ratio into small and large ones, which were within
  and beyond the range of 0.65 to 1.35, respectively. Most of the large-shift aberrations
  were found to be common to all or some of the samples in each case. These were thought
  to represent earlier events in the DNA-diploid stage, while small shifts may possibly
  reflect one-copy changes after tetraploidization or chromosomal instability. Based
  on the breakpoints and on the absolute copy numbers of altered chromosomal parts
  inferred from DNA ploidy and the shift size of the G R ratio, we reconstructed the
  sequence of accumulation and divergence of chromosomal alterations as a dendrogram
  in each case. This method of temporal analysis may enable us to extract important
  early events from numerous aberrations screened by CGH in individual tumors.'
