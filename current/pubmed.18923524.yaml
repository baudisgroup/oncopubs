abstract: Neuroblastoma in advanced stages is one of the most intractable paediatric
  cancers, even with recent therapeutic advances. Neuroblastoma harbours a variety
  of genetic changes, including a high frequency of MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity
  at 1p36 and 11q, and gain of genetic material from 17q, all of which have been implicated
  in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. However, the scarcity of reliable molecular
  targets has hampered the development of effective therapeutic agents targeting neuroblastoma.
  Here we show that the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK , originally identified as
  a fusion kinase in a subtype of non-Hodgkins lymphoma NPM-ALK and more recently
  in adenocarcinoma of lung EML4-ALK , is also a frequent target of genetic alteration
  in advanced neuroblastoma. According to our genome-wide scans of genetic lesions
  in 215 primary neuroblastoma samples using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism
  genotyping microarrays, the ALK locus, centromeric to the MYCN locus, was identified
  as a recurrent target of copy number gain and gene amplification. Furthermore, DNA
  sequencing of ALK revealed eight novel missense mutations in 13 out of 215 6.1 fresh
  tumours and 8 out of 24 33 neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. All but one mutation
  in the primary samples 12 out of 13 were found in stages 3-4 of the disease and
  were harboured in the kinase domain. The mutated kinases were autophosphorylated
  and displayed increased kinase activity compared with the wild-type kinase. They
  were able to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts as shown by their colony formation ability
  in soft agar and their capacity to form tumours in nude mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate
  that downregulation of ALK through RNA interference suppresses proliferation of
  neuroblastoma cells harbouring mutated ALK. We anticipate that our findings will
  provide new insights into the pathogenesis of advanced neuroblastoma and that ALK-specific
  kinase inhibitors might improve its clinical outcome.
