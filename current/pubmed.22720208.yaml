abstract: 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL cells express the receptor for Epstein-Barr
  virus EBV and can be infected in vitro. Infected cells do not express the growth-promoting
  set of EBV-encoded genes and therefore they do not yield LCLs, in most experiments.
  With exceptional clones, lines were obtained however. We describe a new line, HG3,
  established by in vitro EBV-infection from an IGHV1-2 unmutated CLL patient clone.
  All cells expressed EBNA-2 and LMP-1, the EBV-encoded genes pivotal for transformation.
  The karyotype, FISH cytogenetics and SNP-array profile of the line and the patients
  ex vivo clone showed biallelic 13q14 deletions with genomic loss of DLEU7, miR15a
  miR16-1, the two micro-RNAs that are deleted in 50 of CLL cases. Further features
  of CLL cells were: expression of CD5 CD20 CD27 CD43 and release of IgM natural antibodies
  reacting with oxLDL-like epitopes on apoptotic cells cf. stereotyped subset-1 .
  Comparison with two LCLs established from normal B cells showed 32 genes expressed
  at higher levels amp gt 2-fold . Among these were LHX2 and LILRA. These genes may
  play a role in the development of the disease. LHX2 expression was shown in self-renewing
  multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, and LILRA4 codes for a receptor for bone marrow
  stromal cell antigen-2 that contributes to B cell development. Twenty-four genes
  were expressed at lower levels, among these PARD3 that is essential for asymmetric
  cell division. These genes may contribute to establish precursors of CLL clones
  by regulation of cellular phenotype in the hematopoietic compartment. Expression
  of CD5 CD20 CD27 CD43 and spontaneous production of natural antibodies may identify
  the CLL cell as a self-renewing B1 lymphocyte.'
