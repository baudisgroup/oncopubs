abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a powerful new technique for the
  molecular cytogenetic analysis of cancer. In this method, at first the cancer DNA
  and normal DNA are labeled with biotin and digoxigenin, respectively, and then the
  labeled DNAs are applied onto normal lymphocyte metaphase preparations in hybridization.
  After hybridization, they are stained with FITC and rhodamine, respectively, so
  chromosomal gains and losses in cancer are thus detected by using a green:red ratio.
  In this study, we analyzed the abnormal chromosomes in nine cases with human primary
  colon cancer. A gain in chromosomes 11p, 12q, 16p, 20p, and 20q were observed, while
  a loss of 18q and 22q were discovered. CGH may thus provide us with important information
  for analyzing the genes in colon cancer.
