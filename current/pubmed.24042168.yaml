abstract: 'Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm BPDCN is a rare and aggressive
  hematologic malignancy. Simple and complex recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities have
  been reported, which demonstrate predominantly genomic losses, of which deletions
  of 5q are the most frequent aberrations in BPDCN with or without cutaneous manifestation
  however, the gene responsible for the disease remains unknown. Using microarray-based
  molecular characterization, a recent study on several cases of BPDCN with the 5q
  deletion identified a large, common deleted region CDR of 29 Mb that contains several
  possible candidate genes. We report on a 67-year-old female patient who presented
  with leukemic BPDCN without skin involvement and had a deletion of 5q and a t 6
  8 p21 q24 . By oligo-array-comparative genome hybridization a-CGH method, the genomic
  coordinations of the 5q deletion demonstrated unique breakpoints reported for the
  first time. Through mapping with those published cases using the same a-CGH method,
  the CDR was reduced from 29 Mb to 6 Mb, which excluded the previous candidate genes
  and highlighted an excellent biological gene: the HINT1 gene. Moreover, a molecular
  cytogenetic characterization of the translocation t 6 8 was performed in search
  for a novel gene fusion that could be associated with tumor progression.'
