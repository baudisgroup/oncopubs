abstract: The aims of this study were to perform a whole-exome sequencing analysis
  of a breast cylindroma and to investigate the role of molecular analyses in the
  differentiation between breast cylindroma, a benign tumor that displays MYB expression
  and CYLD gene mutations, and its main differential diagnosis, the breast solid-basaloid
  adenoid cystic carcinoma, a malignant tumor that is characterized by the presence
  of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene and MYB overexpression.  A 66-year old female underwent
  quadrantectomy after an irregular dense shadow was discovered in the right breast
  at the screening mammogram. Histologically, the tumor displayed features suggestive
  of a solid-basaloid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma with a differential diagnosis
  of cylindroma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcription PCR, immunohistochemistry
  and whole-exome sequencing revealed absence of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene, low levels
  of MYB protein expression and a clonal somatic CYLD splice site mutation associated
  with loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele.  The results of the histologic,
  immunohistochemical and molecular analyses were consistent with a diagnosis of breast
  cylindroma, providing a proof-of-principle that the integration of histopathologic
  and molecular approaches can help differentiate between a low-malignant potential
  and a benign breast tumor of triple-negative phenotype. This article is protected
