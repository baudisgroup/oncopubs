abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is intensively used for the treatment of
  primary breast cancer. In our previous studies, we reported that clinical tumor
  response to NAC is associated with the change of multidrug resistance (MDR) gene
  expression in tumors after chemotherapy. In this study we performed a combined analysis
  of MDR gene locus deletions in tumor DNA, MDR gene expression and clinical response
  to NAC in 73 BC patients. Copy number variations (CNVs) in biopsy specimens were
  tested using high-density microarray platform CytoScanTM HD Array (Affymetrix, USA).
  75%-100% persons having deletions of MDR gene loci demonstrated the down-regulation
  of MDR gene expression. Expression of MDR genes was 2-8 times lower in patients
  with deletion than in patients having no deletion only in post-NAC tumors samples
  but not in tumor tissue before chemotherapy. All patients with deletions of ABCB1
  ABCB 3 ABCC5 gene loci - 7q21.1, 6p21.32, 3q27 correspondingly, and most patients
  having deletions in ABCC1 (16p13.1), ABCC2 (10q24), ABCG1 (21q22.3), ABCG2 (4q22.1),
  responded favorably to NAC. The analysis of all CNVs, including both amplification
  and deletion showed that the frequency of 13q14.2 deletion was 85% among patients
  bearing tumor with the deletion at least in one MDR gene locus versus 9% in patients
  with no deletions. Differences in the frequency of 13q14.2 deletions between the
  two groups were statistically significant (p = 2.03 ï¿½10-11, Fisher test, Bonferroni-adjusted
  p = 1.73 ï¿½ 10-8). In conclusion, our study for the first time demonstrates that
  deletion MDR gene loci can be used as predictive marker for tumor response to NAC.
