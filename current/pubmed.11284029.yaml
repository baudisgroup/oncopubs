abstract: Deletions of 3p25, gains of chromosomes 7 and 10, and isochromosome 17q
  are known cytogenetic aberrations in sporadic renal cell carcinoma RCC . In addition,
  a majority of RCCs have loss of heterozygosity LOH of the Von Hippel-Lindau VHL
  gene located at chromosome band 3p25. Patients who inherit a germline mutation of
  the VHL gene can develop multifocal RCCs and other solid tumors, including malignancies
  of the pancreas, adrenal medulla, and brain. VHL tumors follow the two-hit model
  of tumorigenesis, as LOH of VHL, a classic tumor suppressor gene, is the critical
  event in the development of the neoplastic phenotype. In an attempt to define the
  cytogenetic aberrations from early tumors to late RCC further, we applied spectral
  karyotyping SKY to 23 renal tumors harvested from 6 unrelated VHL patients undergoing
  surgery. Cysts and low-grade solid lesions were near-diploid and contained 1-2 reciprocal
  translocations, dicentric chromosomes, and or isochromosomes. A variety of sole
  numerical aberrations included gains of chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 21, and
  the X chromosome, although no tumors had sole numerical losses. Three patients shared
  a breakpoint at 2p21-22, and three others shared a dicentric chromosome 9 or an
  isochromosome 9q. In contrast to the near-diploidy of the low-grade lesions, a high-grade
  lesion and its nodal metastasis were markedly aneuploid, revealed loss of VHL by
  fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , and contained recurrent unbalanced translocations
  and losses of chromosome arms 2q, 3p, 4q, 9p, 14q, and 19p as demonstrated by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . By combining SKY, CGH, and FISH of multiple tumors from
  the same VHL kidney, we have begun to identify chromosomal aberrations in the earliest
  stages of VHL-related renal cell tumors. Our current findings illustrate the cytogenetic
  heterogeneity of different VHL lesions from the same kidney, which supports the
  multiclonal origins of hereditary RCCs. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
