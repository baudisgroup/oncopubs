abstract: We here report on a case of a blastic tumor, recently described to belong
  to a new entity sharing phenotypic similarities with blood derived plasmocytoid
  dendritic cells and formerly regarded as belonging to the group of natural killer
  cell lymphomas. Besides immunophenotypic characteristics such as the absence of
  T- cell markers and almost complete absence of markers of the myeloid lineage, these
  tumors express CD4, CD56 and CD123, the receptor for interleukin-3. Moreover, using
  the comparative genomic hybridisation technique, CGH, we demonstrate a gain of chromosome
  7q, 22 and a loss of chromosome 3p and 13q. Since this type of hematologic disorder
  often shows its primary manifestation in the skin and often runs a rapidly fatal
  course, it is important to distinguish this from other types of primary cutaneous
  lymphomas.
