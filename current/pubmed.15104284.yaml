abstract: 'Pleuropulmonary blastoma PPB is a rare, aggressive dysontogenetic tumor
  of childhood. We report the comparative genomic hybridization CGH study performed
  on a case of PPB in a 3-year-old-boy. The tumor was characterized by several chromosomal
  imbalances. Gains observed affected regions: 1q12-q23, 3q23-qter, 8pter-q24.1, 9p13-q21,
  17p12-p11, 17q11-q22, 17q23-q25, 19pter-p11, and 19q11-q13.3. Whole chromosome gains
  were detected at 2 and 7. Loss of genetic material was found at regions: 6q13-qter,
  10pter-p13, 10q22-qter, and 20p13. To our knowledge, there have been no CGH reports
  on PPB, but it is interesting to note that 1 the alterations found confirm previous
  cytogenetic reports describing gains of chromosomes 2 and 8 as recurrent abnormalities
  in this type of tumor, suggesting that a gene or genes of putative relevance in
  PPB pathogenesis are mapped at 8p11-p12, and 2 the CGH profile of this case is very
  similar to those observed in embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, in which gains of 2 or
  2q, 7 or 7q, and 8 or 8p and loss of 10q22-qter are consistently found. This finding
  supports the hypothesis that PPB may be tumorigenetically related with embryonal
  rhabdomyosarcoma.'
