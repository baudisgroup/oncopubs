abstract: High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas NECs of the uterine corpus and ovary
  are very rare tumors, and whenever diagnosed, they are usually associated with epithelial
  carcinoma. Because of their rarity, the molecular characteristics of these tumors
  are still unknown. To shed some light, we studied the genetic abnormalities of each
  of the 2 components, NEC and adenocarcinoma, in 4 cases arising in the ovary and
  the uterine corpus using array-comparative genomic hybridization. Both components
  of all 4 cases showed almost similar genetic abnormalities. Genetic alterations
  exclusively seen in adenocarcinomas included losses of 2p21.1, 10q, 12q, 9p23, gains
  on 2p, 3p, 3q, 4p, 5q, 6q, 10p, 15q, and amplification of 6q22.31. However, the
  NEC component showed numerous additional genetic abnormalities in comparison with
  the adenocarcinomas including gain on 6p25.3-p21.2 and 19q12 and losses on 6q24.2-q27,
  19q13.11-13.2, and 19q13.31-13.41, where numerous genes involved in the pathogenesis
  of epithelial ovarian carcinoma have been previously identified. Our data indicate
  that NEC and adenocarcinomas are, in most part, genetically similar tumors and might
  indeed have a common origin. However, the NEC components exhibited more genetic
  abnormalities in comparison with the adenocarcinoma, suggesting that when the NEC
  clones become more dedifferentiated, they acquire additional genetic abnormalities.
  Because of the limited cases analyzed, a larger study is still needed to confirm
  our observation.
