abstract: Human uterine leiomyomas ULM are characterized by dysregulation of a large
  number of genes and non-coding regulatory microRNAs. In order to identify microRNA::mRNA
  associations relevant to ULM pathogenesis, we examined global correlation patterns
  between the altered microRNA expression and the predicted target genes in ULMs and
  matched myometria.
