abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and malignant type of glioma,
  is characterized by a poor prognosis and the lack of an effective treatment, which
  are due to a small sub-population of cells with stem-like properties, termed glioma
  stem cells (GSCs). The term "multiforme" describes the histological features of
  this tumor, that is, the cellular and morphological heterogeneity. At the molecular
  level multiple layers of alterations may reflect this heterogeneity providing together
  the driving force for tumor initiation and development. In order to decipher the
  common "signature" of the ancestral GSC population, we examined six already characterized
  GSC lines evaluating their cytogenomic and epigenomic profiles through a multilevel
  approach (conventional cytogenetic, FISH, aCGH, MeDIP-Chip and functional bioinformatic
  analysis). We found several canonical cytogenetic alterations associated with GBM
  and a common minimal deleted region (MDR) at 1p36.31, including CAMTA1 gene, a putative
  tumor suppressor gene, specific for the GSC population. Therefore, on one hand our
  data confirm a role of driver mutations for copy number alterations (CNAs) included
  in the GBM genomic-signature (gain of chromosome 7- EGFR gene, loss of chromosome
  13- RB1 gene, loss of chromosome 10-PTEN gene); on the other, it is not obvious
  that the new identified CNAs are passenger mutations, as they may be necessary for
  tumor progression specific for the individual patient. Through our approach, we
  were able to demonstrate that not only individual genes into a pathway can be perturbed
  through multiple mechanisms and at different levels, but also that different combinations
  of perturbed genes can incapacitate functional modules within a cellular networks.
  Therefore, beyond the differences that can create apparent heterogeneity of alterations
  among GSC lines, there's a sort of selective force acting on them in order to converge
  towards the impairment of cell development and differentiation processes. This new
  overview could have a huge importance in therapy.
