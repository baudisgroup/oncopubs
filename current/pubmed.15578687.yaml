abstract: Previous low-resolution studies of chromosome 22 in ovarian carcinoma have
  suggested its involvement in the development of the disease. We report a high-resolution
  analysis of DNA copy number and gene expression of 22q in 18 ovarian carcinomas
  using a 22q-specific genomic microarray. We identified aberrations in 67 of the
  studied tumors, which displayed 3 distinct gene copy number profiles. The majority
  of the cases 11 of 18 demonstrated heterozygous terminal deletions of various sizes,
  the smallest of which was 3.5 Mb. The second profile, detected in 3 tumors, revealed
  the coexistence of heterozygous deletions and different patterns of low-copy-number
  gain that involved the proximal half of 22q. The latter finding has not been reported
  previously in ovarian carcinoma. One case displayed a continuous deletion encompassing
  the entire 22q, consistent with monosomy 22. Furthermore, we compared the results
  with the available data on these tumors by using cDNA microarrays to define the
  degree of correlation between abnormalities at the DNA level and variation in mRNA
  expression. By a comparison with the expression data, we were able to identify 21
  deleted genes showing low mRNA levels and 12 amplified genes displaying elevated
  gene expression, several of which play roles in cell cycle control and the induction
  of apoptosis. Our results indicated significant correlation between DNA copy number
  aberrations and variation in mRNA expression. We also identified several regions
  and candidate genes on 22q that should be studied further to determine their role
  in the development of ovarian cancer.
