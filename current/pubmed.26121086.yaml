abstract: Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system
  that is often lethal when relapse occurs. We here used whole-exome sequencing, mRNA
  expression profiling, array CGH and DNA methylation analysis to characterize 16
  paired samples at diagnosis and relapse from individuals with neuroblastoma. The
  mutational burden significantly increased in relapsing tumors, accompanied by altered
  mutational signatures and reduced subclonal heterogeneity. Global allele frequencies
  at relapse indicated clonal mutation selection during disease progression. Promoter
  methylation patterns were consistent over disease course and were patient specific.
  Recurrent alterations at relapse included mutations in the putative CHD5 neuroblastoma
  tumor suppressor, chromosome 9p losses, DOCK8 mutations, inactivating mutations
  in PTPN14 and a relapse-specific activity pattern for the PTPN14 target YAP. Recurrent
  new mutations in HRAS, KRAS and genes mediating cell-cell interaction in 13 of 16
  relapse tumors indicate disturbances in signaling pathways mediating mesenchymal
  transition. Our data shed light on genetic alteration frequency, identity and evolution
  in neuroblastoma.
