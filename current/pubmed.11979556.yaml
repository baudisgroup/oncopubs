abstract: 'For a better understanding of genetic alterations in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma HNSCC , we applied comparative genomic hybridization CGH in the analysis
  of 75 HNSCCs, comprised of 18 pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas PSCCs , 23 laryngeal
  squamous cell carcinomas LSCCs , and 34 oral squamous cell carcinomas OSCCs . The
  three subgroups of HNSCC showed significant differences in genetic alteration patterns.
  Overall, PSCC and LSCC had more copy number aberrations CNAs per tumor than did
  OSCC. Apparent differing patterns of high-level amplification were also observed.
  The smallest recurrent chromosomal regions of high-level amplification amp gt or
  15 of cases were 7q22, 8q24.1, and 11q12-13 in PSCC and 3q26.1-29 in OSCC. According
  to single frequency and combined frequencies of CNAs, we concluded that the most
  important chromosomal events for progression of head and neck cancer were 3q, 5p,
  8q, and -3p for all subgroups of HNSCC additionally, 7q, 17q, -9p, and -13q for
  PSCC 7p, 9q, 11q12-13, 14q, and 17q for LSCC and 1p and 11q12-13 for OSCC. To identify
  further important genetic alterations and the relationships among the alterations,
  we constructed oncogenetic tree models for tumor progression of HNSCC from CGH data
  using branching and distance-based tree models. The tree models predicted that:
  1 3q21-29 was the most important early chromosomal event, and -3p, which occurred
  after 3q21-29, was also an important chromosomal event for all subsites of HNSCC
  2 8q is the second most important early chromosomal event 3 there may be at least
  three subgroups of HNSCC: one characterized by -3p, -9p, 7p, and -13q another by
  5p, 9qter, and 17p and the other by 8q and 18p. These results suggest that different
  chromosomal aberrations may play a role in the initiation and or progression of
  different subgroups of HNSCC.'
