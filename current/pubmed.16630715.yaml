abstract: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma MFH of bone is a rare, highly malignant tumour.
  As very little is known about its genetic alterations, 26 bone MFHs were analysed
  by comparative genomic hybridisation CGH . Twenty-three tumours 89 had DNA sequence
  copy number changes mean, 7.2 changes per sample . Gains were more frequent than
  losses gains:losses 2.5:1 . Minimal common regions for the most frequent gains were
  8q21.3-qter 35 , 9q32-qter 35 , 7q22-q31 35 , 1q21-q23 31 , 7p12-pter 31 , 7cen-q11.2
  31 and 15q21 31 . Minimal common regions for the most frequent losses were 13q21-q22
  42 and 18q12-q22 27 . High-level amplifications were detected in 8 out of the 26
  tumours 31 . The only recurrent amplifications, 1q21-q23 and 8q21.2-q22, were present
  in two samples 8 . As copy number increase at 8q24 the locus of C-MYC was frequent,
  the expression of C-MYC was studied by immunohistochemistry. Increased levels of
  c-myc protein were detected in 7 out of 21 tumours studied 33 . 81 of the samples
  studied both by CGH and immunohistochemistry showed concordant results. Furthermore,
  the findings of the present study were compared to previous publications on osteosarcoma,
  soft tissue MFH and fibrosarcoma of bone. Clear differences were detected in CGH
  aberration patterns, further supporting the concept of bone MFH as an individual
  bone tumour entity. Finally, the findings of the present study reflect well the
  high malignancy and aggressive nature of bone MFH.
