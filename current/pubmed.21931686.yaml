abstract: Desmoid tumours also called deep or aggressive fibromatoses are potentially
  life-threatening fibromatous lesions. Hereditary desmoid tumours arise in individuals
  affected by either familial adenomatous polyposis FAP or hereditary desmoid disease
  HDD carrying germline mutations in APC. Most sporadic desmoids carry somatic mutations
  in CTNNB1. Previous studies identified losses on 5q and 6q, and gains on 8q and
  20q as recurrent genetic changes in desmoids. However, virtually all genetic changes
  were derived from sporadic tumours. To investigate the somatic alterations in FAP-associated
  desmoids and to compare them with changes occurring in sporadic tumours, we analysed
  17 FAP-associated and 38 sporadic desmoids by array comparative genomic hybridisation
  and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. Overall, the desmoids displayed
  only a limited number of genetic changes, occurring in 44 of cases. Recurrent gains
  at 8q 7 and 20q 5 were almost exclusively found in sporadic tumours. Recurrent losses
  were observed for a 700 kb region at 5q22.2, comprising the APC gene 11 , a 2 Mb
  region at 6p21.2-p21.1 15 , and a relatively large region at 6q15-q23.3 20 . The
  FAP-associated desmoids displayed a significantly higher frequency of copy number
  abnormalities 59 than the sporadic tumours 37 . As predicted by the APC germline
  mutations among these patients, a high percentage 29 of FAP-associated desmoids
  showed loss of the APC region at 5q22.2, which was infrequently 3 seen among sporadic
  tumours. Our data suggest that loss of region 6q15-q16.2 is an important event in
  FAP-associated as well as sporadic desmoids, most likely of relevance for desmoid
  tumour progression.
