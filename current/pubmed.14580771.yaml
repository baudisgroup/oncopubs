abstract: 'It is widely believed that most human tumors, including esophageal squamous
  cell carcinoma ESCC , arise through multistep genetic and cytogenetic alterations.
  The time sequence of these alterations, however, is still unknown. The present study
  was designed to differentiate common early changes from uncommon later ones with
  combined comparative genomic hybridization CGH and ploidy analyses in multiple or
  single samples of 12 ESCCs. We first demonstrated that the mean copy numbers of
  chromosomes 3 and 11, determined directly by fluorescence in situ hybridization,
  showed linear correlation with the mean copy numbers calculated from the G R ratio
  of CGH and DNA ploidy R 2 0.714, P amp lt 0.0001 . On this basis, we estimated the
  absolute copy numbers of chromosomal parts by applying the ploidy-dependent threshold
  criteria to the G R ratio data after the criteria were corrected by the percentage
  of tumor cells in each sample. One-copy changes in the DNA-diploid stage may give
  large shifts of the G R ratio, even after tetraploidization, whereas those after
  tetraploidization undergo small shift. Using the tumors with multiple samples, it
  was actually demonstrated that most of the gains common to the samples in individual
  tumors showed the large shifts. Though early changes varied from tumor to tumor
  in the nine informative cases, it was found that gains of 3q 5 7: number of cases
  with large-shift 3q total number of cases with 3q , 8q 3 4 , 11q13 4 5 , and 14q
  3 4 were early events, while losses of 3p 2 8 , 5q 1 5 , 13q 1 5 , and 21q 1 5 ,
  and gains of 1p 1 4 and Xq 1 4 were later events in progression of individual tumors.'
