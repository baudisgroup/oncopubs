abstract: 'S zary syndrome SS is a rare form of erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
  with hematological involvement and a poor prognosis. At present little is known
  about the molecular pathogenesis of this malignancy. To address this issue, we analyzed
  28 SS cases through the use of molecular cytogenetic techniques. Conventional cytogenetic
  analysis showed 12 of 28 cases with clonal chromosome abnormalities 43 . Seven cases
  had aberrations affecting chromosomes 1 and 17 five demonstrated rearrangement of
  chromosomes 10 and 14 four presented with an abnormality of 6q. Multiplex-fluorescence
  in situ hybridization M-FISH revealed complex karyotypes in 6 of 17 cases 35 , and
  recurrent der 1 t 1 10 p2 q2 and der 14 t 14 15 q q translocations were each identified
  in two cases, and confirmed by dual-color FISH. There was an overall difference
  in the incidence of clonal abnormalities detected by G-banded karyotyping and M-FISH.
  In addition, comparative genomic hybridization studies revealed chromosome imbalances
  CIs in 9 of 20 cases 45 , with a mean DNA copy number change per sample of 1.95
  - 2.74, and losses mean: 1.25 - 1.77 more frequent than gains mean: 0.7 - 1.26 .
  The most common CIs noted were loss of 1p, followed by losses of 10 10q, 17p, and
  19, and gains of 17q and 18. Furthermore, in conjunction with this study a systematic
  literature review was conducted, which showed a high frequency and consistent pattern
  of chromosome changes in SS. These findings suggest that chromosomal instability
  is common in SS, although there are specific chromosomal abnormalities that appear
  to be characteristic, and the identification of two different recurrent chromosome
  translocations provides the basis for further studies.'
