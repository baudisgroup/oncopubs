abstract: Rhabdoid tumors represent an independent entity among embryonal neoplasms.
  These tumors affect the kidney RTK, rhabdoid tumor of kidney and central nervous
  system AT RT, atypical teratoid, rhabdoid tumor , but may also be found in peripheral
  soft tissue. Unifying features include immunohistochemical characteristics and inactivation
  of the putative tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 hSNF5 INI1 in chromosome 22q11.2.
  Several familial cases have been published and summarized under the term rhabdoid
  tumor predisposition syndrome. In all of the published familial cases, inactivation
  of SMARCB1 was detected in tumor tissues.
