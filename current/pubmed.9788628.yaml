abstract: Lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS and atypical lobular hyperplasia ALH of the
  breast are cytologically similar breast lesions that reportedly carry different
  relative risks of subsequent development of invasive carcinoma. They are frequently
  multifocal and bilateral. We have identified the chromosomal copy number changes
  in 31 LCIS and 14 ALH lesions from 28 cases and also the 7 invasive carcinomas that
  subsequently developed in 6 of these cases. This was achieved by comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis of microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material.
  There was no significant difference between the aberrations found in the unilateral
  versus the bilateral cases of LCIS. Loss of material from 16p, 16q, 17p, and 22q
  and also gain of material from 6q were found at a similar high frequency in LCIS
  and ALH. Loss of these genomic regions may indicate the locations of genes that
  predispose to the development of the lesions, and the results are consistent with
  LCIS and ALH representing the same genetic stage of development. Comparison of the
  comparative genomic hybridization results from LCIS ALH with those from ductal carcinoma
  in situ and invasive cancer showed some similarities at the chromosomal level, but
  it also showed significant differences, including gain of 1q and 8q and evidence
  for genomic amplification, which were not found in LCIS ALH. A genetic model is
  postulated for the possible relationships between noninvasive lobular lesions and
  invasive breast carcinoma, delineating potential roles for specific chromosome copy
  number changes.
