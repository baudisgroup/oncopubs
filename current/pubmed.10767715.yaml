abstract: Despite the continuous progress in molecular methodology, the genetic events
  involved in the initiation and progression of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
  remain largely unknown. In this study, 33 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were
  screened for genomic alterations by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . To date,
  most CGH studies of pancreatic cancer have been based on cell lines. To emphasize
  genetic imbalances that are involved in the in vivo development and progression
  of pancreatic carcinoma only fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded tumour samples were
  analysed in the present study. Twenty-two tumours 67 showed genomic alterations
  involving up to three 12 or more 55 chromosomal regions. The number and nature of
  the genetic imbalances did not, however, correlate with tumour stage or grade. Chromosome
  18 was preferentially altered in the tumours analysed. Frequent chromosomal losses
  were found at 18q, 10q, 8p, and 13q. Commonly gained regions were located on 8q
  and 3q. Moreover, high copy number amplifications of the chromosomal regions 5p,
  8q22-ter, 12p12-cen, 19q12-13.2, and 20q were identified. These data provide evidence
  for the occurrence of characteristic genomic alterations which are of biological
  relevance for the genesis of pancreatic cancer. The identified altered chromosomal
  regions may harbour tumour genes which involved in the multistep process of pancreatic
  carcinogenesis.
