abstract: Cytogenetic evaluation is a key component of the diagnosis and prognosis
  of chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . We performed oligonucleotide-based comparative
  genomic hybridization microarray analysis on 34 samples with CLL and known abnormal
  karyotypes previously determined by cytogenetics and or fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH .
