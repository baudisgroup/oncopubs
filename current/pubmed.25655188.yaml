abstract: BackgroundHuman epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) overexpression
  and gene amplification are currently established by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. This study investigates
  whether high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays can provide additional
  diagnostic power to assess HER2 gene status.MethodsDNA from 65 breast tumor samples
  previously diagnosed by HER2 IHC and FISH analysis were blinded and examined for
  HER2 copy number variation employing SNP array analysis.ResultsSNP array analysis
  identified 24 (37%) samples with selective amplification or imbalance of the HER2
  region in the q-arm of chromosome 17. In contrast, only 15 (23%) tumors were found
  to have HER2 amplification by IHC and FISH analysis. In total, there was a discrepancy
  in 19 (29%) samples between SNP array and IHC/FISH analysis. In 12 of these cases,
  the discrepancy towards FISH could be attributed to concomitant amplification or
  deletion of the centromeric region, which harbors the FISH reference probe sequence.
  In 3 tumors, repeated IHC/FISH analysis revealed that the original IHC/FISH analysis
  had failed to indicate the correct HER2 expression level. Finally, the SNP array
  analysis revealed that more than two thirds of the samples exhibited polyploidy
  that was unrecognized by conventional FISH.ConclusionsCollectively, the data show
  that determination of HER2 copy number variations by SNP array-based genomic segmentation
  analysis is an effective supplement to IHC/FISH HER2 analysis that, by providing
  additional diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, may elect more women for targeted
  treatment with HER2 inhibitors.
