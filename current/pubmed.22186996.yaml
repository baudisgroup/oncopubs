abstract: To assess the frequency of TP53 alterations and their correlation with other
  genetic changes and outcome in acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype CK-AML
  , we performed integrative analysis using TP53 mutational screening and array-based
  genomic profiling in 234 CK-AMLs. TP53 mutations were found in 141 of 234 60 and
  TP53 losses were identified in 94 of 234 40 CK-AMLs in total, 164 of 234 70 cases
  had TP53 alterations. TP53-altered CK-AML were characterized by a higher degree
  of genomic complexity aberrations per case, 14.30 vs 6.16 P lt .0001 and by a higher
  frequency of specific copy number alterations, such as -5 5q-, -7 7q-, -16 16q-,
  -18 18q-, 1 1p, and 11 11q amp11q13 approximately 25 among CK-AMLs, TP53-altered
  more frequently exhibited a monosomal karyotype MK . Patients with TP53 alterations
  were older and had significantly lower complete remission rates, inferior event-free,
  relapse-free, and overall survival. In multivariable analysis for overall survival,
  TP53 alterations, white blood cell counts, and age were the only significant factors.
  In conclusion, TP53 is the most frequently known altered gene in CK-AML. TP53 alterations
  are associated with older age, genomic complexity, specific DNA copy number alterations,
  MK, and dismal outcome. In multivariable analysis, TP53 alteration is the most important
  prognostic factor in CK-AML, outweighing all other variables, including the MK category.
