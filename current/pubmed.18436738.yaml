abstract: 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL has a variable clinical course. Presence
  of specific genomic aberrations has been shown to impact survival outcomes and can
  help categorize CLL into clinically distinct subtypes. We studied 178 CLL patients
  enrolled in a prospective study at the University of Michigan, of whom 139 and 39
  were previously untreated and previously treated, respectively. We obtained unbiased,
  high-density, genome-wide measurements of subchromosomal copy number changes in
  highly purified DNA from sorted CD19 cells and buccal cells using the Affymetrix
  50kXbaI SNP array platform Santa Clara, CA . Genomic complexity scores were derived
  and correlated with the surrogate clinical end points time to first therapy TTFT
  and time to subsequent therapy TTST : measures of disease aggressiveness and or
  therapy efficaciousness. In univariate analysis, progressively increasing complexity
  scores in previously untreated CLL patients identified patients with short TTFT
  at high significance levels. Similarly, TTST was significantly shorter in pretreated
  patients with high as opposed to low genomic complexity. In multivariate analysis,
  genomic complexity emerged as an independent risk factor for short TTFT and TTST.
  Finally, algorithmic subchromosomal complexity determination was developed, facilitating
  automation and future routine clinical application of CLL whole-genome analysis.'
