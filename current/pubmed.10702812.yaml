abstract: We have previously reported on a complex chromosome rearrangement der 17
  in a B-cell line, BRG A, established from an AIDS patient with Burkitts lymphoma
  BL . The aim of the present study was the definition of der 17 composition and the
  identification of complete or partial chromosome gains and losses in two cell clones
  BRG A and BRG M derived from this patient.
