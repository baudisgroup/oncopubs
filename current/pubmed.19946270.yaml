abstract: Mutation of the gene PARK2, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the
  most common cause of early-onset Parkinsons disease. In a search for multisite tumor
  suppressors, we identified PARK2 as a frequently targeted gene on chromosome 6q25.2-q27
  in cancer. Here we describe inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic
  deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies. The PARK2 mutations in cancer occur in
  the same domains, and sometimes at the same residues, as the germline mutations
  causing familial Parkinsons disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive
  effects of the PARK2 protein. PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2s E3 ligase
  activity, compromising its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E and resulting in mitotic
  instability. These data strongly point to PARK2 as a tumor suppressor on 6q25.2-q27.
  Thus, PARK2, a gene that causes neuronal dysfunction when mutated in the germline,
  may instead contribute to oncogenesis when altered in non-neuronal somatic cells.
