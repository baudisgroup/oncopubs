abstract: 'Cervical cancer CC cells exhibit complex karyotypic alterations, which
  is consistent with deregulation of numerous critical genes in its formation and
  progression. To characterize this karyotypic complexity at the molecular level,
  we used cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to analyze 29 CC cases
  and identified a number of over represented and deleted genes. The aCGH analysis
  revealed at least 17 recurrent amplicons and six common regions of deletions. These
  regions contain several known tumor-associated genes, such as those involved in
  transcription, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, ion-transport, drug metabolism,
  and immune response. Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH approach
  we demonstrated the presence of high-level amplifications at the 8q24.3, 11q22.2,
  and 20q13 regions in CC cell lines. To identify amplification-associated genes that
  correspond to focal amplicons, we examined one or more genes in each of the 17 amplicons
  by Affymetrix U133A expression arrays and semiquantitative reverse-transcription
  PCR RT-PCR in 31 CC tumors. This analysis exhibited frequent and robust upregulated
  expression in CC relative to normal cervix for genes EPHB2 1p36 , CDCA8 1p34.3 ,
  AIM2 1q22-23 , RFC4, MUC4, and HRASLS 3q27-29 , SKP2 5p12-13 , CENTD3 5q31.3 , PTK2,
  RECQL4 8q24 , MMP1 and MMP13 11q22.2 , AKT1 14q32.3 , ABCC3 17q21-22 , SMARCA4 19p13.3
  LIG1 19q13.3 , UBE2C 20q13.1 , SMC1L1 Xp11 , KIF4A Xq12 , TMSNB Xq22 , and CSAG2
  Xq28 . Thus, the gene dosage and expression profiles generated here have enabled
  the identification of focal amplicons characteristic for the CC genome and facilitated
  the validation of relevant genes in these amplicons. These data, thus, form an important
  step toward the identification of biologically relevant genes in CC pathogenesis.
