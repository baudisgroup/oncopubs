abstract: Deletion of ATM detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH in chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia predicts short treatment free survival and poor outcome following
  alkylator purine analogue therapy. We describe five cases, with a diminished ATM
  FISH signal, investigated by TP53 mutation dysfunction studies and single nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP array. The diminished signal represented loss of the ATM gene,
  which could have been missed were the cases not further investigated. These rare
  cases highlight the need for careful consideration of the choice of probe and interpretation
  of unusual signal patterns in FISH screening. We define a new minimal region of
  deletion at 11q22.3.
