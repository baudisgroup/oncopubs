abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC is characterised pathologically by
  a marked desmoplastic stromal reaction that significantly reduces the sensitivity
  and specificity of cytogenetic analysis. To identify genetic alterations that reflect
  the characteristics of the tumour in vivo, we screened a total of 23 microdissected
  PDAC tissue samples using array-based comparative genomic hybridisation array CGH
  with 1 Mb resolution. Highly stringent statistical analysis enabled us to define
  the regions of nonrandom genomic changes. We detected a total of 41 contiguous regions
  amp gt 3.0 Mb of copy number changes, such as a genetic gain at 7p22.2-p15.1 26.0
  Mb and losses at 17p13.3-p11.2 13.6 Mb , 18q21.2-q22.1 12.0 Mb , 18q22.3-q23 7.1
  Mb and 18q12.3-q21.2 6.9 Mb . To validate our array CGH results, fluorescence in
  situ hybridisation was performed using four probes from those regions, showing that
  these genetic alterations were observed in 37-68 of a separate sample set of 19
  PDAC cases. In particular, deletion of the SEC11L3 gene 18q21.32 was detected at
  a very high frequency 13 out of 19 cases 68 and in situ RNA hybridisation for this
  gene demonstrated a significant correlation between deletion and expression levels.
  It was further confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR that SEC11L3 mRNA was downregulated
  in 16 out of 16 PDAC tissues 100 . In conclusion, the combination of tissue microdissection
  and array CGH provided a valid data set that represents in vivo genetic changes
  in PDAC. Our results raise the possibility that the SEC11L3 gene may play a role
  as a tumour suppressor in this disease.
