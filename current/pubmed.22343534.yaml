abstract: To gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  DLBCL , we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor
  samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent
  mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including
  MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for
  which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes
  include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show
  that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2 IgH rearrangements as a
  result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point
  mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine
  deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of
  enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that
  are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of
  the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function
  mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally
  relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely
  drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view
  of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic
  strategies for the disease.
