abstract: Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor with a high incidence and a
  low survival rate. In order to identify genetic alterations associated with this
  tumor, we screened 23 gastric adenocarcinomas for recurrent chromosomal imbalances
  by using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The most common gains of chromosomal
  material were found on chromosome arms 20q 10 cases , 16p 7 cases , and 1q 4 cases
  and on chromosome 11 4 cases . Losses were observed on chromosome arms 4q, 5q, 9p,
  and 21q 3 cases each . Four tumors exhibited high-level amplifications localized
  on chromosome regions 2p23-p24, 7q31-q32, 8p21-p22, 10q25-q26, 11q13, 17q11-q21,
  and 20q. Based on the position of these amplifications, candidate onco genes were
  selected and subsequently tested by Southern blot analysis of the respective tumors.
  Of the seven tested candidates, MYCN, MET, WNT2, and ERBB2 were found to participate
  in the amplicons of the respective tumor samples. Of these four presumably activated
  oncogenes, two, MYCN and WNT2, were previously not assumed to play a pathogenic
  role in stomach cancer. Among the other regions of imbalance, gain of 20q seems
  particularly interesting, because it is found in almost half of the analyzed cases
  and is highly amplified. Our data allowed us to narrow the relevant region down
  to the commonly gained bands 20q12-q13.1. This and other imbalanced regions provide
  a basis for searching new putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved
  in the development or progression of gastric adenocarcinoma.
