abstract: 'Until now, few data on additional chromosomal aberrations in t 11 14 -positive
  mantle cell lymphomas MCLs have been published. We analyzed 39 t 11 14 -positive
  MCLs by either comparative genomic hybridization CGH n 8 , fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH with a set of DNA probes detecting the most frequent aberrations
  in B-cell neoplasms n 12 , or both techniques n 19 . The t 11 14 was present in
  all cases. In 37 of 39 cases, chromosomal imbalances were found. In 27 cases, complex
  karyotypes, i.e., amp gt 3 aberrations, were identified. The most frequent aberrations
  were losses of 13q14-21 or 13q32-34 27 cases , 9p21 16 cases , and 11q22-23 12 cases
  and gains of 3q26-29 19 cases , 8q22-24 11 cases , and 18q21-22 9 cases . In 26
  of cases 7 of 27 analyzed by CGH, a total of 10 high-level DNA amplifications were
  identified. Although in comparison with B-cell chronic lymphopcytic leukemia B-CLL
  MCL is characterized by a much higher complexity of chromosomal aberrations, there
  are striking similarities: 13q14 deletions were identified in more than 50 of both
  MCL and B-CLL cases. In contrast, in our CGH database containing 293 B-cell lymphomas,
  this aberration was found in only 11 of other nodal lymphomas. Even more strikingly,
  11q deletions, which are present in 20 -30 of MCL and B-CLL, were found very rarely
  in other nodal B-cell lymphomas CGH: 1 of 208 cases FISH: 1 of 69 cases . These
  data show that MCL is characterized by specific secondary aberrations and that there
  may be similarities in the pathogenesis of MCL and B-CLL. Genes Chromosomes Cancer
