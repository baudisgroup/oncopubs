abstract: Approximately 70 of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphomas
  can be successfully treated with H. pylori eradication. The translocation t 11 18
  q21 q21 characteristic of MALT lymphoma is recognized as a marker for H. pylori
  independency, but this marker is found in only a half of the MALT lymphomas resistant
  to H. pylori eradication. Detailed analyses of the genomic features of eradication
  resistant as well as responsive groups are important for understanding their molecular
  basis. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH for
  29 gastric MALT lymphomas treated with H. pylori eradication. These comprised ten
  cases of t 11 18 positive MALT, nine cases of t 11 18 negative MALT with H. pylori
  dependency, and ten cases of t 11 18 negative MALT with H. pylori independency.
  Array-CGH analysis demonstrated that no significant genetic alterations were found
  in t 11 18 positive MALT lymphomas, but numerous genomic alterations were detected
  in t 11 18 negative MALT lymphomas. Many of these alterations were similar to those
  found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with trisomy 3 being the most recurrent alteration.
  Within the t 11 18 negative MALT lymphoma without large cell components group, genomic
  imbalances occurred more frequently in the H. pylori independent than in the H.
  pylori dependent group P 0.02 . Genomic imbalances are associated with H. pylori
  independency in t 11 18 negative gastric MALT lymphomas. They may thus play an important
  role in the development of H. pylori independency.
