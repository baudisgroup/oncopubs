abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is an incurable B cell lymphoma and accounts for
  6 of all non-Hodgkins lymphomas. On the genetic level, MCL is characterized by the
  hallmark translocation t 11 14 that is present in most cases with few exceptions.
  Both gene expression and comparative genomic hybridization CGH data vary considerably
  between patients with implications for their prognosis.
