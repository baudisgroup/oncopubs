abstract: Different subtypes of neuroblastoma NB carry associated genetic aberrations
  that predict their clinical course. Whole chromosome gains are usually associated
  with early clinical stages and good prognosis, while 1p deletion, 17q gain and MYCN
  amplification MNA are related to advanced stages and poor prognosis. High-risk neuroblastomas
  NB-HR include NB in children aged more than 1 year old, either stage 4 or any stages
  showing MNA except stage 1. The prognosis of NB-HR patients remains poor, despite
  aggressive therapy. Only MNA confers poor prognosis. Between January 2000 and February
  2005, tumoral specimens from 60 patients with NB-HR were sent to the Spanish Reference
  Center for NB biological studies. In all cases, MYCN together with 1p36 status was
  analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH was performed in 24 cases. Using FISH we detected 31 MNA cases including 29
  with 1p36 deletion there were 21 cases without MYCN amplification MNNA but 7 of
  these had 1p36 deletion 8 cases showed MYCN gain MNG but 6 of these had 1p36 deletion.
  CGH showed other chromosomal alterations. Of 11 MNA cases, none had 11q loss and
  all of them showed 17q gain or 17 disomy. Of the 7 MNNA cases, there were 4 with
  11q loss including 2 with 3p loss and all presented 17q gain or 17 disomy. The 6
  MNG cases included 4 cases with 11q loss and 5 cases with 17q gain or 17 disomy.
  Genomic profiling by CGH in NB-HR confirms the interaction among genetic alterations,
  the prognostic significance of which should be evaluated to establish new treatment
  criteria.
