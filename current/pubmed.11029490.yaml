abstract: In order to optimize the management of patients with renal cell carcinoma
  RCC it is important to define the genetic risk for metastatic disease. In this study
  we performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH on metastatic tumors aiming at
  the identification of genetic alterations associated with metastatic disease. We
  analyzed 46 renal tumors along with their metastases, and 15 non-metastatic renal
  tumors. Tumors were classified pathologically according to the Heidelberg classification
  of RCC, and staged according to the TNM-system. Standard CGH was performed using
  microdissected archival tissues and DOP-PCR. The average numbers of chromosomal
  aberrations per tumor were 3.0, 2.1 and 3.9 in patients without metastasis, in patients
  who developed metastases after a two-year latency period late onset of metastatic
  disease and in patients who developed metastases within two years after therapy
  of the primary tumor early onset of metastatic disease . CGH revealed chromosomal
  aberrations in 91 of primary metastatic tumors. Deletions or losses of chromosomes
  9 26 vs 6 , 10 21 vs 6 and 18 23 vs 0 and 17 28 vs 7 occurred more often in metastatic
  tumors than in non-metastatic tumors. Furthermore, these aberrations were more common
  in patients with early metastases. CGH analysis of 40 pairs of primary RCCs and
  their corresponding metastasis revealed similar aberrations in 70 of cases. In 30
  , however, metastases showed additional chromosomal aberrations not detected in
  the corresponding primary tumors. In conclusion, we identified genetic alterations
  associated with metastatic disease in RCC which could be useful for predicting prognosis.
  Genetic changes leading to metastases occurred early in tumorigenesis of metastatic
  tumors.
