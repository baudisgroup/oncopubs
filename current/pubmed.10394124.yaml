abstract: In order to elucidate cytogenetic changes characteristic of biliary tract
  cancer, we examined the genetic imbalances in 18 biliary tract cancers using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . The most common sites of increases in copy number, in
  order of frequency, were 17q 33 of the cases , 5p 28 , 3q 22 , 7p 22 , 8q 22 , and
  12p 22 , whereas copy number decreases of 6q 28 , 18q 28 , 4q 22 , 5q 22 , and 9p
  22 were frequent. The average number of chromosomal aberrations was significantly
  greater in stage IV than in stage III tumors 7.9 vs. 2.2 tumor, p amp lt 0.05 .
  The frequent aberrations detected in this study may be related to the development
  and or progression of biliary tract cancers. This is the first report on CGH of
  biliary tract cancers.
