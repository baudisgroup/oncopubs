abstract: We describe a progressive mantle cell lymphoma MCL in which multicolor fluorescence
  in situ hybridization M-FISH on metaphases did not detect the characteristic t 11
  14 q13 q32 , although translocations of chromosomes 11 with 15, and 14 with 15 were
  observed. When CCND1 IGH probes were hybridized to metaphases, however, cryptic
  fusion signals were detected on the der 11 and der 14 sites of CCND1 11q13 and IGH
  14q32 , revealing a complex translocation involving chromosomes 11, 14, and 15.
  Interphase FISH with CCND1 IGH probes revealed varying patterns with one or two
  fusion signals, and some with no clear evidence of fusion. Loss of 17p and gain
  of 3q, known to be associated with disease progression in MCL, were detected with
  M-FISH and confirmed with the use of p53 and BCL6 probes together with comparative
  genomic hybridization, which detected also an interstitial deletion on 7p21. This
  case further illustrates the value of M-FISH in combination with fusion probes in
  elucidating complex cytogenetic abnormalities.
