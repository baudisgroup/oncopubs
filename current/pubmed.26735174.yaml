abstract: Little is known about changes within the mitochondrial (mt) genome during
  tumor progression in general and during initiation and progression of neuroblastoma
  (NB) in particular. Whole exome sequencing of corresponding healthy tissue, primary
  tumor and relapsed tumor from 16 patients with NB revealed that most NB harbor tumor-specific
  mitochondrial variants. In relapsed tumors, the status of mt variants changed in
  parallel to the status of nuclear variants, as shown by increased number and spatio-temporal
  differences of tumor-specific variants, and by a concomitant decrease of germline
  variants. As mt variants are present in most NB patients, change during relapse
  and have a higher copy number compared to nuclear variants, they represent a promising
  new source of biomarkers for monitoring and phylogenetic analysis of NB.
