abstract: 'We report 2 novel, cryptic chromosomal abnormalities in precursor B-cell
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia BCP-ALL : a translocation, either t X 14 p22 q32 or
  t Y 14 p11 q32 , in 33 patients and an interstitial deletion, either del X p22.33p22.33
  or del Y p11.32p11.32 , in 64 patients, involving the pseudoautosomal region PAR1
  of the sex chromosomes. The incidence of these abnormalities was 5 in childhood
  ALL 0.8 with the translocation, 4.2 with the deletion . Patients with the translocation
  were older median age, 16 years , whereas the patients with the deletion were younger
  median age, 4 years . The 2 abnormalities result in deregulated expression of the
  cytokine receptor, cytokine receptor-like factor 2, CRLF2 also known as thymic stromal-derived
  lymphopoietin receptor, TSLPR . Overexpression of CRLF2 was associated with activation
  of the JAK-STAT pathway in cell lines and transduced primary B-cell progenitors,
  sustaining their proliferation and indicating a causal role of CRLF2 overexpression
  in lymphoid transformation. In Down syndrome DS ALL and 2 non-DS BCP-ALL cell lines,
  CRLF2 deregulation was associated with mutations of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain,
  suggesting oncogenic cooperation as well as highlighting a link between non-DS ALL
  and JAK2 mutations.'
