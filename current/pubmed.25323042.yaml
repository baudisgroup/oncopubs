abstract: DNA aneuploid sublines in sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) are quite frequent
  (about 85%) and likely the consequence of chromosomal instability and DNA copy number
  aberrations (CNAs). In order to gain insight into the mechanisms of the diploid-aneuploid
  transition in CRCs, we compared the CNA status in both diploid and aneuploid sublines.
  We used fresh/frozen material from 17 aneuploid CRCs, which was separated into 17
  DNA diploid and 17 aneuploid sublines using enrichment of the epithelial component
  by multiparameter flow cytometry and sorting. CNA status of both sublines was obtained
  by array comparative genomic hybridization. The DNA diploid sublines from the aneuploid
  CRCs showed already CNAs, in particular, gains at 20 p and 20 q. The same aberrations
  were detected at increased frequencies in the corresponding DNA aneuploid sublines.
  Moreover, the very frequent gains/losses of chromosomes 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, and 18
  in the DNA aneuploid sublines were absent or rare in the DNA diploid sublines from
  the same sporadic aneuploid CRCs. The comparison of the DNA diploid and aneuploid
  sublines from aneuploid CRCs suggests that 20 p and 20 q gains may play a role in
  the diploid-aneuploid transition. The 20 q chromosomal arm appears of particular
  interest since it harbors several genes implicated in chromosomal instability.
