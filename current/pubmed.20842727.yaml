abstract: Predicting evolution of small node-negative breast carcinoma is a real challenge
  in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to search whether qualitative or
  quantitative DNA changes may help to predict metastasis of small node-negative breast
  carcinoma. Small invasive ductal carcinomas without axillary lymph node involvement
  T1T2N0 from 168 patients with either good 111 patients with no event at 5 years
  after diagnosis or poor 57 patients with early metastasis outcome were analyzed
  with comparative genomic hybridization CGH array. A CGH classifier, identifying
  low- and high-risk groups of metastatic recurrence, was established in a training
  set of 78 patients, then validated, and compared with clinicopathological parameters
  in a distinct set of 90 patients. The genomic status of regions located on 2p22.2,
  3p23, and 8q21-24 and the number of segmental alterations were defined in the training
  set to classify tumors into low- or high-risk groups. In the validation set, in
  addition to estrogen receptors and grade, this CGH classifier provided significant
  prognostic information in multivariate analysis odds ratio, 3.34 95 confidence interval
  1.01-11.02 P 4.78 10 -2 , Wald test . This study shows that tumor DNA contains important
  prognostic information that may help to predict metastasis in T1T2N0 tumors of the
  breast.
