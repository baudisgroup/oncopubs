abstract: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor IMT is a soft tissue neoplasm composed
  of myofibroblastic spindle cells accompanied by the inflammatory infiltrate. In
  addition to its phenotypic ambiguity, pathogenic mechanisms of the IMT also remain
  elusive. Although several chromosomal aberrations have been identified by karyotyping,
  detailed characteristics and extent of copy number alterations in IMT are unknown.
  Copy number alterations of an IMT case were examined using 30K whole-genome oligoarray-comparative
  genomic hybridization. RNA expression of putative cancer-related genes located in
  the chromosomal altered regions was assessed by qRT-PCR. We identified seven copy
  number gained regions, seven lost regions, nine amplifications and six homozygous
  deletions, which covers 2.5 of total genome. In homozygously deleted regions, RNA
  levels of putative tumor suppressors, SEMA3B, SEMA3F and SULT2A1, were significantly
  repressed being consistent with copy number status. In high-level amplification
  regions, RNA expression of four potential cancer-related genes was examined GSTT1,
  ESR1, EVI1 and MITF. Among them, GSTT1 and ESR1 were significantly up-regulated,
  but EVI1 and MITF showed insignificant elevation of RNA expression. To our knowledge,
  this is the first genome-wide analysis of copy number alterations in IMT. Most of
  the putative cancer-related genes identified in this study are supposedly novel
  in IMT. Taken together, our results will help to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms
  of IMT.
