abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH provides a technique to survey
  the human genome for chromosomal aberrations in disease. The identification of genomic
  regions with aberrations may clarify the initiation and progression of cancer, improve
  diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and guide therapy. The analysis of variance
  ANOVA model is widely used to detect differentially expressed genes after accounting
  for common sources of variation in microarray analysis. In this study, we propose
  a method, shifted ANOVA, to detect significantly altered regions. This method, based
  on the standard ANOVA, analyzes changes in copy number variation for regions. The
  selected regions have the group effect only, but no effect within samples and no
  interactive effects. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated from the
  homogeneity and classification accuracies of the selected regions. Shifted ANOVA
  may identify new candidate genes neighboring known because it detects significantly
  altered chromosomal regions, rather than independent probes.
