abstract: 'Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) defines a distinct
  subgroup of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) that
  has a dismal outcome when treated with standard therapy. For improved diagnosis
  and risk stratification, the initiating genetic events need to be elucidated. To
  investigate the genetic basis of BCP-ALL, genomes of 94 iAMP21 patients were interrogated
  by arrays, FISH, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Most copy
  number alterations targeted chromosome 21, reinforcing the complexity of this chromosome.
  The common region of amplification on chromosome 21 was refined to a 5.1-mb region
  that included RUNX1, miR-802, and genes mapping to the Down syndrome critical region.
  Recurrent abnormalities affecting genes in key pathways were identified: IKZF1 (22%),
  CDKN2A/B (17%), PAX5 (8%), ETV6 (19%), and RB1 (37%). Investigation of clonal architecture
  provided evidence that these abnormalities, and P2RY8-CRLF2, were secondary to chromosome
  21 rearrangements. Patient outcome was uniformly poor with standard therapy irrespective
  of the presence or absence of these changes. This study has provided evidence that
  chromosome 21 instability is the only anomaly among those so far investigated that
  is common to all iAMP21 patients, and therefore the initiating event is likely to
  be found among the complex structural rearrangements of this abnormal chromosome.'
