abstract: Angiopoietin-like protein 2 ANGPTL2 is a secreted protein belonging to the
  angiopoietin family, the members of which are implicated in various biological processes,
  although its receptor remains unknown. We identified a homozygous loss of ANGPTL2
  9q33.3 in the course of screening a panel of ovarian cancer OC cell lines for genomic
  copy-number aberrations using in-house array-based comparative genomic hybridization.
  ANGPTL2 mRNA expression was observed in normal ovarian tissue and immortalized normal
  ovarian epithelial cells, but was reduced in some OC lines without its homozygous
  deletion 18 of 23 lines and restored after treatment with 5-aza 2-deoxycytidine.
  The methylation status of sequences around the ANGPTL2 CpG-island with clear promoter
  activity inversely correlated with expression. ANGPTL2 methylation was frequently
  observed in primary OC tissues as well. In an immunohistochemical analysis of primary
  OCs, ANGPTL2 expression was frequently reduced 51 of 100 cases , and inversely correlated
  with methylation status. Patients with OC showing reduced ANGPTL2 immunoreactivity
  had significantly worse survival in the earlier stages stages I and II , but better
  survival in advanced stages stages III and IV . The restoration of ANGPTL2 expression
  or treatment with conditioned medium containing ANGPTL2 inhibited the growth of
  OC cells originally lacking the expression of this gene, whereas the knockdown of
  endogenous ANGPTL2 accelerated the growth of OC cells with the expression of ANGPTL2.
  These results suggest that, at least partly, epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation
  of the ANGPTL2 promoter leads to a loss of ANGPTL2 function, which may be a factor
  in the carcinogenesis of OC in a stage-dependent manner.
