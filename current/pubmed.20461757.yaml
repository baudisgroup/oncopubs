abstract: Loss of chromosome arm 8p, sometimes in combination with amplification of
  proximal 8p, is found in urothelial carcinoma UC and other epithelial cancers and
  is associated with more advanced tumor stage. We carried out array comparative genomic
  hybridization on 174 UC and 33 UC cell lines to examine breakpoints and copy number.
  This was followed by a detailed analysis of the cell lines using fluorescence in
  situ hybridization FISH and, in some cases, M-FISH, to refine breakpoints and determine
  translocation partners, heterozygosity analysis, and analysis of expression of selected
  genes. We showed an overall pattern of 8p loss with reduced heterozygosity and reduced
  gene expression. Amplification was seen in some samples and shown in the cell line
  JMSU1 to correlate with overexpression of ZNF703, ERLIN2, PROSC, GPR124, and BRF2.
  Apart from the centromere, no single breakpoint was overrepresented, and we postulate
  that frequent complex changes without consistent breakpoints reflect the need for
  alterations of combinations of genes. The region around 2 Mb, which was homozygously
  deleted in one cell line and includes the gene ARHGEF10 and the micro-RNA hsa-mir-596,
  is one candidate tumor suppressor gene region.
