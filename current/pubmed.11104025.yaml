abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a valuable technique for cytogenetic
  analysis of solid tumors. To evaluate the reliability of CGH, we examined DNA of
  10 ovarian carcinomas after CGH analysis with single- and double-locus fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH . The FISH experiments, involving 5 chromosomes chromosomes
  3, 6, 8, 12, and 18 with different FISH probes, confirmed the CGH results in 66.2
  of cases 92 of 139 investigated loci . In 4 patients, inconsistent results 41 loci
  were related to polyploidy, because CGH cannot detect polyploid karyotypes. The
  remaining 6 discordant loci can be referred to limitations in both techniques. Re-evaluation
  of FISH and CGH results by one other is therefore recommended to overcome these
  technical artifacts. Nevertheless, CGH is of potential value in characterizing chromosomal
  alterations and might help in generating tumor-specific sets of FISH probes to obtain
  genetic information of prognostic value within a few days.
