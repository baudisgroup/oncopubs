abstract: Lung carcinoma is a common malignancy, and tobacco carcinogenesis is the
  major cause. Studies on individual genes or loci have suggested, that in tumors
  from nonsmokers, different genetic alterations are present compared with tumors
  from smokers. It is possible that distinct genetic pathways may be involved. However,
  the targets remain largely unknown and, to the authors knowledge, molecular cytogenetics
  studies on lung carcinomas from nonsmokers have not been reported.
