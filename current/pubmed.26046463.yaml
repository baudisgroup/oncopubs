abstract: Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a rare and aggressive form of plasma
  cell dyscrasia and may represent a valid model for high-risk multiple myeloma (MM).
  To provide novel information concerning the mutational profile of this disease,
  we performed the whole-exome sequencing of a prospective series of 12 pPCL cases
  included in a Phase II multicenter clinical trial and previously characterized at
  clinical and molecular levels. We identified 1, 928 coding somatic non-silent variants
  on 1, 643 genes, with a mean of 166 variants per sample, and only few variants and
  genes recurrent in two or more samples. An excess of C > T transitions and the presence
  of two main mutational signatures (related to APOBEC over-activity and aging) occurring
  in different translocation groups were observed. We identified 14 candidate cancer
  driver genes, mainly involved in cell-matrix adhesion, cell cycle, genome stability,
  RNA metabolism and protein folding. Furthermore, integration of mutation data with
  copy number alteration profiles evidenced biallelically disrupted genes with potential
  tumor suppressor functions. Globally, cadherin/Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix
  and cell cycle checkpoint resulted the most affected functional pathways. Sequencing
  results were finally combined with gene expression data to better elucidate the
  biological relevance of mutated genes. This study represents the first whole-exome
  sequencing screen of pPCL and evidenced a remarkable genetic heterogeneity of mutational
  patterns. This may provide a contribution to the comprehension of the pathogenetic
  mechanisms associated with this aggressive form of PC dyscrasia and potentially
  with high-risk MM.
