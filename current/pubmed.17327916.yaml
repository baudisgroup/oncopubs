abstract: Neuroblastomas are characterized by chromosomal alterations with biological
  and clinical significance. We analyzed paired blood and primary tumor samples from
  22 children with high-risk neuroblastoma for loss of heterozygosity LOH and DNA
  copy number change using the Affymetrix 10K single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array.
