abstract: We have undertaken a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array
  analysis of 41 chronic myeloid leukemia CML patients. In total, 44 regions of uniparental
  disomy UPD amp gt 3 Mb were identified in 24 of 32 patients in chronic phase CP
  , and 21 regions of UPD amp gt 3 Mb were identified in 13 of 21 patients in blast
  crisis BC . Chromosome 8 had the highest frequency of UPD regions in both CP and
  BC samples. Eight recurrent regions of UPD were observed among the 41 patients,
  with chromosome 8 showing the highest frequency. Ten regions of copy number change
  CNC amp gt 3 Mb were observed in 4 of 21 patients in BC, whereas none were observed
  in CP. We have identified several recurrent regions of UPD and CNC in CML that may
  be of pathogenetic importance. Overrepresentation of genomic aberrations UPD and
  copy number gain mapping to chromosome 8 was observed. Selected candidate genes
  mapping within the aberrant genomic regions were sequenced and mutation of the TP53
  gene was observed in one case in BC and of the ASXL1 gene in 6 of 41 cases in CP
  or BC. Mutation of ASXL1 represents an important new molecular abnormality in CML.
