abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  were used to define genetic changes associated with multifocal bladder cancer and
  to investigate whether the genetic relationship between synchronous urothelial tumors
  is similar to that observed within different parts of the same tumor. We investigated
  8 synchronous urothelial tumors from 3 patients and macroscopically different parts
  of the same tumor from 2 other patients. The most frequent imbalances were gains
  of 1q, 2p, and 17q, and losses in 4q. The high number of chromosome imbalances detected
  in the present report confirms that a high level of chromosome instability could
  be characteristic of multicentric bladder tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization
  profiles obtained from independent tumors belonging to the same patient allowed
  us to elaborate cytogenetic pedigrees portraying the accumulation of chromosome
  alterations as a form of clonal evolution from a single precursor cell. The analysis
  of different macroscopic parts of the same tumor allowed us to detect chromosomal
  heterogeneity and to delineate intratumor clonal evolution. Some chromosome regions
  that appeared as a gain in one subpopulation were amplified in others indicating
  a genetic evolution process. Identical processes were observed in different tumors
  of the same patient. Expansion of chromosome gains and losses between different
  parts of the same tumor as well as in different tumors of the same patient was also
  observed. Our results not only provide further evidence of a clonal relationship
  between different synchronous bladder tumors but also show that the intratumor heterogeneity
  present in different subpopulations of the same tumor reproduces the behavior of
  independent synchronous tumors in a same patient.
