abstract: Rhabdomyosarcomas RMS are the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcomas.
  They resemble developing skeletal muscle and are histologically divided into two
  main subtypes alveolar and embryonal RMS. Characteristic genomic aberrations, including
  the PAX3- and PAX7-FOXO1 fusion genes in alveolar cases, have led to increased understanding
  of their molecular biology. Here, we determined the effect of genomic copy number
  on gene expression levels through array comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis
  of 13 RMS cell lines, confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
  copy number analyses, combined with their corresponding expression profiles. Genes
  altered at the transcriptional level by genomic imbalances were identified and the
  effect on expression was proportional to the level of genomic imbalance. Extrapolating
  to a public expression profiling dataset for 132 primary RMS identified features
  common to the cell lines and primary samples and associations with subtypes and
  fusion gene status. Genes identified such as CDK4 and MYCN are known to be amplified,
  overexpressed, and involved in RMS tumorigenesis. Of the many genes identified,
  those with likely functional relevance included CENPF, DTL, MYC, EYA2, and FGFR1.
  Copy number and expression of FGFR1 was validated in additional primary material
  and found amplified in 6 out of 196 cases and overexpressed relative to skeletal
  muscle and myoblasts, with significantly higher expression levels in the embryonal
  compared with alveolar subtypes. This illustrates the ability to identify genes
  of potential significance in tumor development through combining genomic and transcriptomic
  profiles from representative cell lines with publicly available expression profiling
  data from primary tumors.
