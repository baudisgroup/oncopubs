abstract: Although the significance of tumour site for estimating malignant potential
  in gastrointestinal stromal tumours GISTs has recently been recognized, site-specific
  genetic patterns have not to date been defined. This study examined 52 c-kit-positive
  primary GISTs with a mean follow-up of 42.3 months in 51 cases from three different
  locations 35 gastric, 12 small intestinal, and five colorectal using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . In general, tumour site correlated with key prognostic
  factors, including tumour size, mitotic rate, proliferative activity, and probable
  malignant potential. Furthermore, several DNA copy number changes showed a site-dependent
  pattern. These included losses at 14q gastric 83 , intestinal 35 p 0.001 , losses
  at 22q gastric 46 , intestinal 82 p 0.02 , losses at 1p gastric 23 , intestinal
  88 p 1 x 10 -5 , losses at 15q gastric 14 , intestinal 59 p 0.002 , losses at 9q
  gastric 14 , intestinal 53 p 0.006 , and gains at 5p gastric 11 , intestinal 53
  p 0.002 . These data demonstrate strong site-dependent genetic heterogeneity in
  GISTs that may form a basis for subclassification. Prognostic evaluation of DNA
  copy number changes identified losses at 9q as a site-independent prognostic marker
  associated with shorter disease-free survival p 0.03 and overall survival p 0.002
  . Furthermore, 9q loss also appeared to carry prognostic value in predicting overall
  survival for patients with advanced or progressive GISTs p 0.003 .
