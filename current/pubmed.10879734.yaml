abstract: Although there seems to be a common stem cell for the two epithelial cell
  types in the breast, the vast majority of breast cancers exhibit a luminal phenotype.
  Pure myoepithelial carcinomas are rare. We report our findings of genetic alterations
  in these tumors. We have analyzed 10 cases of pure myoepithelial cell carcinomas
  using laser capture microdissection and comparative genomic hybridization. The mean
  number of changes was 2.1 range 0-4 , compared with a mean of 8.6 range 3.6-13.8
  in unselected ductal carcinomas. Common alterations included loss at 16q 3 10 cases
  , 17p 3 10 , 11q 2 10 , and 16p 2 10 , regions also commonly deleted in ductal carcinomas.
  The single case in which both pure myoepithelial carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma
  was present showed 2 alterations in the myoepithelial tumor losses at 17p and 17q
  , whereas the invasive ductal component showed 15 alterations 5 gains and 9 losses
  , including loss at 17p. The sharing of 17p loss in myoepithelial and ductal carcinoma
  is consistent with a common stem cell model in the breast. The relatively few genetic
  alterations in otherwise aggressive neoplasms suggests that myoepithelial tumors
  may be a good model for the delineation of genes important in breast tumorigenesis.
