abstract: 'Osteosarcoma OS is an aggressive bone tumor characterized by complex abnormal
  karyotypes and a high level of genomic instability. Using high-resolution array
  comparative genomic hybridization aCGH , a novel class of localized copy number
  variations called microaberrations has been detected. These genomic anomalies typically
  involve DNA imbalances affecting 700 kb to 1 Mb DNA, and are often associated with
  some type of genetic syndromes. Because the origin of instability in OS is poorly
  understood, we used aCGH to determine whether microaberrations were a characteristic
  of four OS cell lines: U-2 OS, HOS, MG-63, and SAOS-2. TP53 is mutated in SAOS-2,
  a line in which 17 microaberrations were found. In contrast, U-2 OS, which has a
  wild-type TP53, had only six such anomalies, the lowest incidence. A 500-kb microaberration
  within a region of gain at 5p15.33 in SAOS-2 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ
  hybridization. Significantly, this genomic location is close to the TERT gene, a
  region of gain in all four cell lines. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
  analysis of the incidence of microaberrations in OS. The high levels of these anomalies
  detected suggest that the instability processes in OS that lead to a highly abnormal
  karyotypes may also be associated with acquisition of genomic microaberrations.'
