abstract: "A chemosensitive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery schema
  is presented that utilizes (i) genome-wide SNP screening, with a human SNP array
  and an in vitro chemosensitivity assay, in 93 patients with gastric cancer (GC),
  and (ii) biological utility assessment using cell viability assays of transfected
  GC cells. Cytotoxicity analysis showed that most of the MKN1 and SNU638 clones transfected
  with the G allele of Deoxyribonuclease II beta (DNASE2B) rs3738573 were more sensitive
  to docetaxel than those with the C allele (pâ\x89¤0.001-0.029) and most of the AGS
  and SNU638 clones transfected with the T allele of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor
  IE (HTRIE) rs3828741 were more sensitive to paclitaxel than those with the C allele
  (pâ\x89¤0.001-0.019). Our findings show that the two novel markers, DNASE2B rs3738573
  and HTR1E rs3828741, have potential for improving the prediction of chemosensitivity
  of GC patients."
