abstract: We describe a family of three sisters affected by malignant mesothelioma
  MM 2 pleural and 1 peritoneal and one brother affected by pleural plaques. All members
  of the family had been subjected to previous asbestos exposure of environmental-residential
  type. For 13 years, from 1951 to 1964, their housing was provided by the fathers
  employer, an asbestos cement factory, and the factory warehouse was on the ground
  floor of the building they lived in. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded MM samples
  was used to search for chromosomal alterations by a comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH method. In two cases, a loss at 9p was found to be the only change. The loss
  at 9p is a frequent event in malignant mesothelioma and the fact that this anomaly
  was diagnosed in two sisters as the only alteration suggests that this region may
  be the site of one or more oncosuppressor genes that could play an important role
  in the development of MM and in inducing greater genetic susceptibility to the carcinogenic
  effects of asbestos.
