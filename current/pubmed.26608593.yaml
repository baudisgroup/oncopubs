abstract: Despite the many efforts already spent to enumerate somatic mutations in
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), previous whole-genome and whole-exome studies
  conducted on patients of mixed outcomes failed at characterizing the 30% of patients
  who will relapse or resist current immunochemotherapies. To address this issue,
  we performed whole-exome sequencing of normal/tumoral DNA pairs in 14 relapsed/refractory
  (R/R) patients subclassified by full-transcriptome arrays (six activated B-cell
  like, three germinal center B-cell like, and five primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas),
  from the LNH-03 LYSA clinical trial program. Aside from well-known DLBCL features,
  gene and pathway level recurrence analyses proposed several interesting leads including
  TBL1XR1 and activating mutations in IRF4 or in the insulin regulation pathway. Sequencing-based
  copy number analysis defined 23 short recurrently altered regions involving genes
  such as REL, CDKN2A, HYAL2, and TP53. Moreover, it highlighted mutations in genes
  such as GNA13, CARD11, MFHAS1, and PCLO as associated with secondary variant allele
  amplification events. The five primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas (PMBL), while
  unexpected in a R/R cohort, showed a significantly higher mutation rate (P = 0.003)
  and provided many insights on this classical Hodgkin lymphoma related subtype. Novel
  genes such as XPO1, MFHAS1, and ITPKB were found particularly mutated, along with
  various cytokine-based signaling pathways. Among these analyses, somatic events
  in the NF-ÎºB pathway were found preponderant in the three DLBCL subtypes, confirming
  its major implication in DLBCL aggressiveness and pinpointing several new candidate
  genes. Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
