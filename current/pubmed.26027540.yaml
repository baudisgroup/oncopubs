abstract: Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a rare myeloproliferative stem cell disorder.
  The genomic features in PMF are poorly understood. Characterization of genomic alternations
  in PMF helps to determine their association with clinicopathologic features for
  further therapeutic implications.  In this retrospective study, we investigated
  genomic changes using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in 17
  PMF patients with isolated del(13q) and confirmed our aCGH findings with quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. We also compared the clinicopathologic features
  of patients with del(13q) (nï¿½= 17) with those of patients with a normal karyotype
  (NK) (nï¿½= 26).  Clinicopathologically, del(13q) PMF patients had significantly
  higher blast counts (Pï¿½= .03) than did NK patients, who had significantly higher
  marrow cellularity (Pï¿½= .02). The degree of bone marrow fibrosis of PMF-3 was
  higher in the del(13q) group than in the NK group. Splenomegaly was present significantly
  more often in the del(13q) PMF group than in the NK group (Pï¿½= .03). Genomically,
  the Janus Kinase 2 V617F mutation was observed less often in del(13q) PMF patients
  (Pï¿½= .07). The common deleted region in del(13q) was confined to 13q13-13q14.3
  according to G-band karyotyping, demonstrating a minimal deleted region (MDR) of
  15.323 Mb, identified using aCGH. The tumor suppressor genes, Retinoblastoma, Forkhead
  box protein O1, and Succinyl -CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta in the MDR were
  deleted, confirmed using real-time PCR to confirm our aCGH findings.  Accurate molecular
  characterization of del(13q) in PMF using aCGH and quantitative PCR provided further
  insight to define the MDR and analyze the genomic changes in del(13q) PMF patients.  Copyright
