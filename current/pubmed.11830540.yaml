abstract: The aim of this study is to explore the mechanisms of intratumoral cytogenetic
  heterogeneity ICH in pancreatic cancer. Using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis, we investigated interglandular variation in 20 primary invasive ductal
  adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Three or four adjacent neoplastic glands were individually
  microdissected from a tumor specimen. Extracted DNA from each gland was amplified
  by degenerate oligonucleotide primed-PCR, followed by CGH. In addition, DNA index
  DI was measured by laser scanning cytometry in each case. CGH profiles displayed
  a wide variety of differences between glands within the same tumor in all cases,
  i.e., interglandular cytogenetic heterogeneity was distinct in pancreatic cancers.
  In this study, genetic changes detected in all regions of a tumor were classified
  as amp quot region-independent amp quot alterations, whereas changes seen in at
  least one, but not all regions were designated as amp quot region-dependent amp
  quot alterations, which resulted in ICH. The degree of ICH, which was manifested
  as the ratio of these two types of alterations, correlated closely with DI Spearman
  rho 0.842 P 0.0002 . Therefore, DI might be a surrogate marker for ICH. These results
  suggest that with tumor progression, ICH and DNA aneuploidy result from the successive
  appearance of region-dependent alterations attributable to chromosomal instability
  in tumor cells. Our data support a concept of individual cell heterogeneity in pancreatic
  cancer.
