abstract: Osteosarcomas OS are aggressive tumors of the bone and often have a poor
  prognosis. Conventional cytogenetic analyses of OS have revealed highly complex
  karyotypes, with numerous abnormalities. In this study, we analyzed 18 untreated
  OS tumors from 17 patients of the younger incidence age group by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH , 4 tumors by spectral karyotyping SKY and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH . Comparative genomic hybridization identified frequent copy
  number changes of the chromosomal region 1p 10 17 and gain of part or all of chromosome
  19 8 17 . In addition gains were observed at 5p 3 17 , 8q 3 17 , 16p 3 17 , and
  17p 5 17 and losses at chromosomes 2q 3 17 , 10 4 17 and 13 3 17 . High level gains
  were detected in the 8q23 approximately q24 region in two tumors as well as at 17p
  in one primary and a metastatic tumor. Minimal regions of gain were present at 1p35
  approximately p36.3 8 17 5p14 approximately p15.2 3 17 , and 8q22 approximately
  q24.3 3 17 . SKY analysis demonstrated that OS has a complex pattern of clonal and
  non-clonal rearrangements and helped confirm the structural basis for the imbalances
  detected by CGH. Spectral karyotyping confirmed an overall pattern of chromosomal
  gain affecting 1p in all four tumors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis
  from these tumors confirmed the gain of the 1p36 region in 2 tumors as determined
  by CGH analysis as well as the amplification of 8q.
