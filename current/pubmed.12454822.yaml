abstract: Paraimmunoblastic variant of small lymphocytic lymphoma chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia SLL CLL is characterized by a diffuse proliferation of cells, called paraimmunoblasts,
  normally located on the pseudoproliferation centers. Patients usually present with
  multiple lymphadenopathies and a rapid and aggressive progression of the disease.
  We report a case with paraimmunoblastic variant of SLL CLL genetically well-characterized
  by conventional cytogenetics, comparative genomic hybridization CGH , IgH BCL-1,
  IgH BCL-2, and p53 fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH probes and polymerase
  chain reaction PCR for detection of IgH BCL-2 translocation. A complex karyotype
  was found, with p53 deletion confirmed by CGH and FISH however, no translocations
  involving either BCL-2 or BCL-1 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were identified.
  A literature review shows only 20 previously reported cases, 6 of which involve
  genetic studies.
