abstract: DNA copy number changes were investigated in 29 leiomyosarcomas by comparative
  genomic hybridization. The most frequent losses were detected in 10q 20 cases, 69
  and 13q 17 cases, 59 . The most frequent gains were detected in 17p 16 cases, 55
  . The most frequent high-level amplifications were detected in 17p 7 cases, 24 and
  8q 6 cases, 21 . A total of 137 losses and 204 gains were detected. Small tumors
  less than 5 cm in diameter displayed fewer changes per sample 3 to 11 mean, 7 than
  the other tumors 4 to 22 mean, 13 . There was an increase in the number of gains
  from small tumors mean, 4 to very large tumors amp gt 20 cm mean, 10 . However,
  the number of losses was similar in small, large, and very large tumors mean, 4.5
  . Tumor size-related aberrations were observed. Gains in 16p were detected in all
  small tumors but were infrequent in large and very large tumors 27 and 11 , respectively
  . Similarly, gains and high-level amplifications in 17p were more common in small
  80 than in very large tumors 33 . Gains in 1q, 5p, 6q, and 8q were not seen in any
  of the small tumors but were detected in large and very large tumors. Gains in 6q
  and 8q occurred in 8 of 9 cases 89 of very large tumors, 5 of them with a high-level
  amplification in 8q.
