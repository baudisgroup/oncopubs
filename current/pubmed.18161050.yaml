abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most common cancers worldwide
  and is characterized by aggressive tumor behavior coupled with poor prognosis. Various
  etiologies have been linked to HCC development, most prominently chronic hepatitis
  B and C virus infections as well as chronic alcohol consumption. In approximately
  10 of HCCs, the etiology remains cryptic however, recent epidemiological data suggest
  that most of these cryptogenic HCCs develop due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
  To identify etiology-dependent DNA copy number aberrations and genes relevant to
  hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  of 63 HCCs of well-defined etiology and 4 HCC cell lines followed by gene expression
  profiling and functional analyses of candidate genes. For a 10-megabase chromosome
  region on 8q24, we observed etiology-dependent copy number gains and MYC overexpression
  in viral and alcohol-related HCCs, resulting in up-regulation of MYC target genes.
  Cryptogenic HCCs showed neither 8q24 gains, nor MYC overexpression, nor target gene
  activation, suggesting that tumors of this etiology develop by way of a distinct
  MYC-independent pathomechanism. Furthermore, we detected several etiology-independent
  small chromosome aberrations, including amplification of MDM4 on 1q32.1 and frequent
  gains of EEF1A2 on 20q13.33. Both genes were overexpressed in approximately half
  the HCCs examined, and gene silencing reduced cell viability as well as proliferation
  and increased apoptosis rates in HCC cell lines.
