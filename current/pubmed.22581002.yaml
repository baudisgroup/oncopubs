abstract: 'Among 4,780 consecutive adult acute lymphoblastic myeloblastic leukemia
  patients, we identified 117 2.4 patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia fulfilling
  WHO 2008 criteria these were classified as: Blymphoid myeloid n 64 , T-lymphoid
  myeloid n 38 , B T-lymphoid n 14 and trilineage n 1 . Of 92 patients karyotyped,
  59 were abnormal and were classified as: complex 22 of 92 , t 9 22 q34 q11 14 of
  92 , monosomy 7 7 of 92 , polysomy 21 7 of 92 , t v 11q23 4 of 92 , t 10 11 p15
  q21 3 of 92 , while STIL-TAL1 fusion was detected in one T My patient. After investigating
  common acute leukemia-related mutations in 17 genes, 12 of 31 39 patients were found
  to have at least one mutation, classified with: IKZF1 deletion 4 of 31 , and EZH2
  3 of 31 , ASXL1 3 of 31 , ETV6 2 of 31 , NOTCH1 1 of 31 , and TET2 1 of 31 mutations.
  Array-CGH revealed genomic deletions of CDKN2A 4 of 12 , IKZF1 3 of 12 , MEF2C 2
  of 12 , BTG1 2 of 12 , together with BCOR, EBF1, K-RAS, LEF1, MBNL1, PBX3, and RUNX1
  one of 12 each . Our results indicate that mixed-phenotype acute leukemia is a complex
  entity with heterogeneous clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular
  genetic features.'
