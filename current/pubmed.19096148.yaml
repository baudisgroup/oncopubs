abstract: Breast phyllodes tumour PT is a rare fibroepithelial tumour. The genetic
  alterations contributing to its tumorigenesis are largely unknown. To identify genomic
  regions involved in pathogenesis and progression of PTs we obtained genome-wide
  copy number profiles by array comparative genomic hybridization CGH .DNA was isolated
  from fresh-frozen tissue samples. 11 PTs and 3 fibroadenomas, a frequently occurring
  fibroepithelial breast tumour, were analyzed. Arrays composed of 2464 genomic clones
  were used, providing a resolution of 1.4 Mb across the genome. Each clone contains
  at least one STS for linkage to the human genome sequence.No copy number changes
  were detected in fibroadenomas. On the other hand, 10 of 11 PT 91 showed DNA copy
  number alterations. The mean number of chromosomal events in PT was 5.5 range 0-16
  per case. A mean of 2.0 gains range 0-10 and 3.0 losses range 0-9 was seen per case
  of PT. Three cases showed amplifications. DNA copy number change was not related
  to PT grade. We observed recurrent loss on chromosome 1q, 4p, 10, 13q, 15q, 16,
  17p, 19 and X. Recurrent copy number gain was seen on 1q, 2p, 3q, 7p, 8q, 16q, 20.In
  this study we used array CGH for genomic profiling of fibroepithelial breast tumours.
  Whereas most PT showed chromosomal instability, fibroadenomas lacked copy number
  changes. Some copy number aberrations had not previously been associated with PT.
  Several well-known cancer related genes, such as TP53 and members of the Cadherin,
  reside within the recurrent regions of copy number alteration. Since copy number
  change was found in all benign PT, genomic instability may be an early event in
  PT genesis.
