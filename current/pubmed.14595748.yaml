abstract: Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia AAH is a probable forerunner of bronchioloalveolar
  carcinoma BAC and pulmonary adenocarcinoma AC of mixed type. The present study analysed
  four low-grade AAHs, 13 high-grade AAHs, two BACs, nine mixed ACs, and one squamous
  cell carcinoma derived from 13 patients using comparative genomic hybridization.
  The average number of chromosomal aberrations was 1.2 in low-grade AAH, 9.6 in high-grade
  AAH, and 12.5 in AC. A high degree of overlap of genetic changes was found in high-grade
  AAH, BAC, and AC within individual patients. The high number of aberrations and
  the degree of shared aberrations found in high-grade AAH and AC raises questions
  about the separation of these two entities. In addition, in view of the monoclonal
  origin of multiple foci within the same patient, AAH may not be a precursor of AC
  in some cases, but rather may represent intraepithelial spread.
