abstract: Little is known about the genomic abnormalities of squamous cell carcinomas
  (SCC) of the vulva and how they correlate with gene expression. We determined the
  genomic and expression profiles of 15 such SCC using karyotyping, DNA ploidy analysis,
  arrayCGH, and expression arrays. Four of the five cases with clonal chromosomal
  aberrations found by G-banding showed highly abnormal karyotypes with multiple rearrangements.
  The imbalances scored by arrayCGH mapped to different chromosomes with losses being
  more common than gains. Frequent losses were scored from 3p and 8p whereas gains
  were frequent from 3q and 8q (loss of 8p with concomitant gain of 8q mostly occurred
  via 8q isochromosome formation). This is the first study of vulvar tumors using
  arrayCGH, and some frequent imbalances could be defined precisely. Of particular
  note were the sometimes large, sometimes small deletions of 3p and 9p which had
  minute areas in 3p14 and 9p23 as minimal commonly deleted regions. FHIT (3p14) and
  PTPRD (9p23) are the only genes here. They were both lost in seven cases, including
  homozygous losses of PTPRD in four tumors. Using qPCR we could demonstrate deregulation
  of the FHIT gene in tumor cells. Hence, this gene is likely to play a pathogenetic
  role in vulvar SCC tumorigenesis. Expression array analyses also identified a number
  of other genes whose expression profile was altered. Notable among the downregulated
  genes were MAL (in 2q11), KRT4 (in 12q13), and OLFM4 (in 13q14), whereas upregulated
  genes included SPRR2G (in 1q21.3) and S100A7A (in 1q21.3).
