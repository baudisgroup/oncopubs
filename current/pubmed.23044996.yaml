abstract: Recent studies have described chromosome 2p gain as a recurrent lesion in
  chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . We investigated the 2p gain and its relationship
  with common prognostic biomarkers in a prospective series of 69 clinical monoclonal
  B-cell lymphocytosis cMBL and 218 early stage Binet A CLL patients. The 2p gain
  was detected by FISH in 17 patients 6 , 16 CLL, and 1 cMBL and further characterized
  by single nucleotide polymorphism-array. Overall, unfavorable cytogenetic deletions,
  i.e., del 11 q23 and del 17 p13 P 0.002 , were significantly more frequent in 2p
  gain cases, as well as unmutated status of IGHV P lt 1 x 10 -4 and CD38 P lt 1 x
  10 -4 and ZAP-70 positive expression P 0.003 . Furthermore, 2p gain patients had
  significantly higher utilization of stereotyped B-cell receptors compared with 2p
  negative patients P 0.009 , and the incidence of stereotyped subset 1 in 2p gain
  patients was significantly higher than that found in the remaining CLLs P 0.031
  . Transcriptional profiling analysis identified several genes significantly upregulated
  in 2p gain CLLs, most of which mapped to 2p. Among these, NCOA1 and ROCK2 are known
  for their involvement in tumor progression in several human cancers, whereas among
  those located in different chromosomes, CAV1 at 7q31.1 has been recently identified
  to play a critical role in CLL progression. Thus, 2p gain can be present since the
  early stages of the disease, particularly in those cases characterized by other
  poor prognosis markers. The finding of genes upregulated in the cells with 2p gain
  provides new insights to define the pathogenic role of this lesion.
