abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technology allow genome-scale approaches to
  cancer mutation discovery. Such data-intensive methods have been applied to cutaneous
  squamous cell carcinomas SCCs and melanomas but have not, to our knowledge, been
  applied to basal cell carcinomas BCCs . We used whole-exome sequencing to characterize
  the mutational landscape of sporadic BCCs. We show that BCCs are the most mutated
  type of human cancer. Tumors from anatomical regions with chronic UV exposure were
  associated with higher mutation rates than those with intermittent exposure. The
  majority of all mutations 75.7 were UV signature. Using a conventional binomial
  probability model, several genes were found mutated significantly. However, this
  model assumes a uniform distribution of mutations throughout the genome. We also
  used a more stringent approach called InVEx that uses a permutation-based framework
  to pick drivers from passengers. After correction for multiple hypothesis testing,
  InVEx identified only PTCH1 Patched 1 as having a significant functional mutation
  burden. We also found three genes, STAT5B, CRNKL1, and NEBL, with mutational hot
  spots at a single base in 3 of 12 tumors sequenced. Our findings support the central
  role of PTCH1 mutations in BCCgenesis. Moreover, our discovery of the uniquely high
  number of mutations in this tumor may lend insight into its biological behavior.Journal
