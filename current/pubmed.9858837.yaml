abstract: Eighty sporadic Wilms tumor samples were analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to identify chromosomal regions involved in the etiology of the
  disease. Twenty percent of the samples showed chromosomal gains or losses. The majority
  of chromosomal gains and losses were similar to those identified through molecular
  and cytogenetic studies. Gains were observed on chromosomes 1q, 7q, 8, and 12, whereas
  losses were found on chromosomes 1p, 4p, 4q, 7p, 16q, 18q, 21q, and 22q. Other genetic
  aberrations identified in this study included deletions of chromosomes 5p and 15q,
  as well as gains of discrete loci on chromosomes 3p and 3q. These latter regions
  have not been previously implicated in Wilms tumorigenesis and may contain novel
  genes relevant to the development and or progression of this disease.
