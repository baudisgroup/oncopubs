abstract: "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive type of lung cancer.
  Only 15% of SCLC patients survive beyond 2 years after diagnosis. Therefore, for
  the improvement of patients' outcome in this disease, it is necessary to identify
  genetic alterations applicable as therapeutic targets in SCLC cells. The purpose
  of this study is the identification of genes frequently mutated and expressed in
  SCLCs that will be targetable for therapy of SCLC patients. Exome sequencing was
  performed in 28 primary tumors and 16 metastatic tumors from 38 patients with SCLCs.
  Expression of mutant alleles was verified in 19 cases by RNA sequencing. TP53, RB1,
  and PTEN were identified as being significantly mutated genes. Additional 36 genes
  were identified as being frequently (â\x89¥10%) mutated in SCLCs by combining the
  results of this study and two recent studies. Mutated alleles were expressed in
  8 of the 36 genes, TMEM132D, SPTA1, VPS13B, CSMD2, ANK2, ASTN1, ASPM and FBN3. In
  particular, the TMEM132D, SPTA1 and VPS13B genes were commonly mutated in both early
  and late stage tumors, primary tumors and metastases, and tumors before and after
  chemotherapy, as in the case of the TP53 and RB1 genes. In addition to TP53, RB1
  and PTEN, TMEM132D, SPTA1 and VPS13B could be also involved in SCLC development,
  with the products from their mutated alleles being potential therapeutic targets
  in SCLC patients.  Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All
