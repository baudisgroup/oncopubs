abstract: Somatically acquired chromosomal imbalances are a key feature of neuroblastoma,
  a heterogeneous pediatric solid tumor. Among these alterations, genomic amplification
  targeting the MYCN oncogene and observed in about 25-30 of the cases, strongly correlates
  with advanced stage and poor outcome. In this work, we have used BAC and SNP arrays
  as well as gene expression arrays to characterize amplifications in neuroblastoma.
  Eighty-eight distinct BACs defining high-level amplification events were identified
  in 65 samples, including 43 tumors and 22 cell lines. Although the highest recurrence
  was observed on chromosome 2, clones on chromosomes 8, 12, 16, and 17 also revealed
  genomic amplification in several samples. A detailed analysis of the 2p22-2p25 MYCN
  containing region indicated highly complex patterns in a number of cases. Coamplifications
  involving MYCN and other regions were explored by FISH in three cell lines. High-resolution
  arrays then allowed us to further refine the mapping of 25 amplicons in 19 samples,
  either reducing the size of a single continuous amplicon or increasing the complexity
  by highlighting multiple noncontiguous regions of amplification. Combined analysis
  of gene expression profiling and array-CGH data indicated that 12 to 25 of the genes
  that are targeted by genomic amplification are actually over-expressed in tumor
  cells, several of them having already been implicated in cancer. Finally, our results
  suggest that the presence of amplicons localized outside of chromosome 2, in addition
  to MYCN amplification, may be linked to a particularly severe outcome in neuroblastoma
  patients.
