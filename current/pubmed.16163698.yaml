abstract: The prognostic divergence of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas is
  well known. Hypopharyngeal tumors are characterized by frequent metastasis formation
  and local recurrence, which is the source of the unfavorable prognosis of this subtype.
  The aim of this study was to define chromosomal alterations associated with the
  aggressive behavior of hypopharyngeal tumors.
