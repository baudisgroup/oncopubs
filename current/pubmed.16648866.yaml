abstract: DNA copy number changes were investigated in 51 19 uterine and 32 nonuterine
  primary leiomyosarcomas by comparative genomic hybridization. The aim was to evaluate
  whether true biological differences exist between uterine and nonuterine leiomyosarcoma
  and whether changes revealed by comparative genomic hybridization have prognostic
  value. Genomic imbalances were found in 48 94 cases. The most frequent DNA copy
  number changes were losses in 10q 35 , 13q 57 , and 16q 41 , gains in 1q 41 , and
  gains and high-level amplifications in 17p 39 . Gains were nearly as frequent as
  losses in both uterine and nonuterine leiomyosarcoma. Correlation-based tree modeling
  revealed two clusters that segregated significantly a group of uterine gains at
  1q11-q24 and a group of nonuterine losses at 13q14-q34, 16q11.1-q24, and 10q21-q26
  cases. The nonuterine cluster was associated with subcutaneous origin and a trend
  toward increased metastasis-free survival. Further explorative analyses identified
  aberrations associated with shorter metastasis-free survival time, including losses
  at 2q32.1-q37 and gains at 8q24.1-q24.3, whereas the cases with losses at 6cen-p25
  showed longer metastasis-free survival time.
