abstract: To obtain more information on chromosomal changes in the up-to-now poorly
  studied tumor class of penile squamous cell carcinoma SCC , we performed a comparative
  genomic hybridization study of 26 cases of this rare tumor. DNA sequence copy number
  alterations CNAs very similar to those detected in other SCC types, such as oral
  and esophageal SCC, were noted. The most common copy number gains were found in
  8q24, 16p11-12, 20q11-13, 22q, 19q13, and 5p15, and the most common deletions were
  detected in 13q21-22, 4q21-32, and along the X chromosome. Classifying the patients
  according to the number of CNAs showed a possible correlation with clinical outcome.
