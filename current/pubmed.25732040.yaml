abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain cancer occurring in
  adults, and is associated with dismal outcome and few therapeutic options. GBM has
  been shown to predominantly disrupt three core pathways through somatic aberrations,
  rendering it ideal for precision medicine approaches.  We describe a 35-year-old
  female patient with recurrent GBM following surgical removal of the primary tumour,
  adjuvant treatment with temozolomide and a 3-year disease-free period. Rapid whole-genome
  sequencing (WGS) of three separate tumour regions at recurrence was carried out
  and interpreted relative to WGS of two regions of the primary tumour.  We found
  extensive mutational and copy-number heterogeneity within the primary tumour. We
  identified a TP53 mutation and two focal amplifications involving PDGFRA, KIT and
  CDK4, on chromosomes 4 and 12. A clonal IDH1 R132H mutation in the primary, a known
  GBM driver event, was detectable at only very low frequency in the recurrent tumour.
  After sub-clonal diversification, evidence was found for a whole-genome doubling
  event and a translocation between the amplified regions of PDGFRA, KIT and CDK4,
  encoded within a double-minute chromosome also incorporating miR26a-2. The WGS analysis
  uncovered progressive evolution of the double-minute chromosome converging on the
  KIT/PDGFRA/PI3K/mTOR axis, superseding the IDH1 mutation in dominance in a mutually
  exclusive manner at recurrence, consequently the patient was treated with imatinib.
  Despite rapid sequencing and cancer genome-guided therapy against amplified oncogenes,
  the disease progressed, and the patient died shortly after.  This case sheds light
  on the dynamic evolution of a GBM tumour, defining the origins of the lethal sub-clone,
  the macro-evolutionary genomic events dominating the disease at recurrence and the
  loss of a clonal driver. Even in the era of rapid WGS analysis, cases such as this
  illustrate the significant hurdles for precision medicine success.  ï¿½ The Author
