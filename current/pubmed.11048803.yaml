abstract: Epithelioid sarcoma is a distinctive, rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically
  involves the distal extremities in young adults, and shows epithelioid morphology
  and immunohistochemical markers of epithelial differentiation. The genetic background
  of epithelioid sarcoma is poorly understood, and knowledge of it could give insights
  into the pathogenesis of this tumor and its possible relationship with other malignant
  tumors. In this study, we analyzed DNA copy number changes in 30 epithelioid sarcomas
  by comparative genomic hybridization. DNA was extracted from microdissected samples
  of formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumors with a minimum of 60 of tumor
  cells in each sample. Sixteen tumors 53 showed DNA copy number changes at one to
  six different genomic sites. The majority of the changes were gains, seen in 14
  tumors, whereas 10 tumors showed losses. The most common recurrent gains were at
  11q13 five cases , 1q21-q23 four cases , 6p21.3 three cases , and 9q31-qter three
  cases . High-level amplifications were detected once in 6p21.3-p21.1 and once in
  9q32-qter. Recurrent losses were seen at 9pter-p23 three cases , 13q22-q32 three
  cases , 1p13-p22 two cases , 3p12-p14 two cases , 4q13-q33 two cases , 9p21 two
  cases , and 13q32-qter two cases . The most common recurrent gain at 11q13 was seen
  in both classic cases and angiomatoid and rhabdoid variants supporting the relationship
  of these variants with the classic epithelioid sarcoma. Expression of cyclin D1
  gene, located in 11q13, was immunohistochemically detected in nine of 15 cases including
  three of five cases with gain of 11q13, suggesting its involvement in epithelioid
  sarcoma. The observed comparative genomic hybridization changes give targets for
  future genetic studies on epithelioid sarcoma.
