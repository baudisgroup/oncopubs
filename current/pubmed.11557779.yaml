abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH , fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH , polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite analysis, and p53 sequencing
  were performed in paraffin-embedded material from 18 oligodendrogliomas and histologically
  similar astrocytomas. The study was undertaken because of evidence that concurrent
  loss of both the 1p and 19q chromosome arms is a specific marker for oligodendrogliomas.
  Of the six lesions with a review diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, all had the predicted
  loss of 1p and 19q seen by CGH, FISH, and polymerase chain reaction. Other lesions,
  including some considered oligodendroglioma or mixed glioma by the submitting institution,
  did not. There were no p53 mutations in any of the six oligodendrogliomas, whereas
  5 of the 10 remaining, successfully studied cases did have p53 mutations. The results
  suggest that CGH and FISH performed on current or archival tissue can aid in classification
  of infiltrating gliomas such as oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. The results
  of the p53 studies are consistent with findings of previous investigations that
  such mutations are less common in oligodendrogliomas than they are in astrocytomas.
