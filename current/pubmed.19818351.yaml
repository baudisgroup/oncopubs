abstract: We have used SNP mapping arrays to simultaneously record copy number changes,
  loss of heterozygosity and allele ratios ploidy in a series of 13 gliomas. This
  combined analysis has defined novel amplification events in this tumor type involving
  chr1:241544532-243005121 and chr18:54716681-54917277 which contain the AKT3 and
  ZNF532 genes, respectively. The high resolution of this analysis has also identified
  homozygous deletions involving chr17:25600031-26490848 and Chr19:53883612-55061878.
  Throughout the karyotypes of these tumors, the combined analysis revealed counter
  intuitive relationships between copy number and LOH that requires reinterpretation
  of the significance of copy number gains and losses. It was not uncommon to observe
  copy number gains that were associated with loss of heterozygosity as well as copy
  number losses that were not. These events appeared to be related to ploidy status
  in the tumors as determined using allelic ratio calculations. Overall, this analysis
  of gliomas provides evidence for the need to perform more comprehensive interpretation
  of the CGH data beyond copy number analysis alone to evaluate the significance of
  individual events in the karyotypes.
