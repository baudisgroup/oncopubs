abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to identify chromosomal imbalances
  in 19 samples of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck HNSCC . The chromosome
  arms most often over-represented were 3q 48 , 8q 42 , and 7p 32 in many cases, these
  changes were observed at high copy number. Other commonly over-represented sites
  were 1q, 2q, 6p, 6q, and 18q. The most frequently under-represented segments were
  3p and 22q. Loss of heterozygosity of two polymorphic microsatellite loci from chromosome
  22 was observed in two tongue tumors, in agreement with the CGH analysis. Gains
  of 1q and 2q material were detected in patients exhibiting a clinical history of
  recurrence and or metastasis followed by terminal disease. This association suggests
  that gain of 1q and 2q may be a new marker of head and neck tumors with a refractory
  clinical response.
