abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to evaluate and map genomic
  aberrations in 50 hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs from patients chronically infected
  with hepatitis B virus HBV . CGH clearly detected nonrandom genomic imbalances.
  Losses were most prevalent on chromosome regions 4q 70 , 8p 65 , 16q 54 , 17p 51
  , 13q and 6q 37 each , and lp 30 . The most frequent gains occurred on 8q 60 , 1q
  58 , and 6p and 17q 33 each . In a few cases, sequence amplifications were detected
  that were mapped to bands 11q12, 12p11, 14q12, and 19q13.1. This study represents
  the first analysis of primary liver cancers by CGH, and it confirms the presence
  of previously known chromosomal aberrations in HCC and highlights new quantitative
  abnormalities and sequence amplifications. These findings should lead to the characterization
  of new loci involved in liver cancer pathogenesis.
