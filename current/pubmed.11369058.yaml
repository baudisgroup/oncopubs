abstract: 'We investigated chromosomal alterations using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , and DNA ploidy patterns using laser scanning cytometry LSC in 8 primary central
  nervous system lymphomas PCNSLs . The average number of chromosomal alterations
  detected by CGH was 6.9 gain: 4.1, deletion: 2.8 . Frequent alterations were gains
  of chromosomes 12, 18q, and X, and deletion of 6q, which were similar to those seen
  in non-CNS diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. DNA aneuploidy was detected by LSC in
  4 of the 8 cases. The DNA aneuploid lymphomas had more chromosomal alterations than
  the DNA diploid ones 9.3 vs. 4.5, P amp lt .05 . The former had higher MIB-1 indices
  than the latter. The present investigation indicates that although most of the PCNSL
  are histologically uniform, they are divided cytogenetically into DNA aneuploid
  and diploid tumors.'
