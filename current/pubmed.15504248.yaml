abstract: CD10 is one of the hallmarks of germinal center B-cells where follicular
  lymphomas FL originate. It has not been clearly established, however, whether CD10
  diffuse B-cell lymphomas DLBCL are genetically similar to FL. We therefore examined
  19 CD10 DLBCL and 40 FL by means of comparative genomic hybridization CGH and tissue-fluorescence
  in situ hybridization T-FISH . Chromosomal imbalance was more frequently detected
  in CD10 DLBCLs 19 19 than in FLs 24 40 . Significant differences were found in eight
  frequently imbalanced regions, namely those with gains of chromosomes 7q and 12
  and those with losses of chromosomes 1p, 4p, 6q, 15q, 16p and 17. Amplification
  of the 3q region where BCL6 is located is reported to occur frequently in DLBCL,
  but it was only found in one of the 19 CD10 DLBCL cases we examined. The involvement
  of t 14 18 in CD10  DLBCL 31 and in FL 73 was significantly different P 0.0064 .
  The CGH pattern of CD10 DLBCL with t 14 18 was also different from that of FL with
  t 14 18 . Taken together, our results indicate that CD10 DLBCL constitutes a unique
  subtype entity with genetic characteristics significantly different from those of
  FL and DLBCL.
