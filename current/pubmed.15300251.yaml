abstract: The identification of tumor-suppressor genes in solid tumors by classical
  cancer genetics methods is difficult and slow. We combined nonsense-mediated RNA
  decay microarrays and array-based comparative genomic hybridization for the genome-wide
  identification of genes with biallelic inactivation involving nonsense mutations
  and loss of the wild-type allele. This approach enabled us to identify previously
  unknown mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene EPHB2. The DU 145 prostate
  cancer cell line, originating from a brain metastasis, carries a truncating mutation
  of EPHB2 and a deletion of the remaining allele. Additional frameshift, splice site,
  missense and nonsense mutations are present in clinical prostate cancer samples.
  Transfection of DU 145 cells, which lack functional EphB2, with wild-type EPHB2
  suppresses clonogenic growth. Taken together with studies indicating that EphB2
  may have an essential role in cell migration and maintenance of normal tissue architecture,
  our findings suggest that mutational inactivation of EPHB2 may be important in the
  progression and metastasis of prostate cancer.
