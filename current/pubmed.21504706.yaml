abstract: 'Colorectal cancer CRC is one of the most common cancers in Denmark and
  in the western world in general, and the prognosis is generally poor. According
  to the traditional molecular classification of sporadic colorectal cancer, microsatellite
  stable MSS chromosome unstable CIN colorectal cancers constitute approximately 85
  of sporadic cases, whereas microsatellite unstable MSI cases constitute the remaining
  15 . In this study, we used array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to identify
  genomic hotspot regions that harbor recurrent copy number changes. The study material
  comprised fresh samples from 40 MSS tumors and 20 MSI tumors obtained from 60 Danish
  CRC patients. We identified five small genomic regions amp lt 15 megabases exhibiting
  recurrent copy number loss, which, to our knowledge, have not been reported in previously
  published aCGH studies of CRC: 3p25.3, 3p21.2-p21.31, 5q13.2, 12q24.23-q24.31, and
  12q24.23-q24.31. These regions contain several potentially important tumor suppressor
  genes that may play a role in a significant proportion of both sporadic MSS CRC
  and MSI CRC. Furthermore, the generated aCGH data are in support of the recently
  proposed classification of sporadic CRC into MSS CIN , MSI CIN-, MSI CIN , and MSS
  CIN- cancers.'
