abstract: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FFPE archival tissue is an important source
  of DNA material. The most commonly used technique to identify copy number aberrations
  from chromosomal DNA in tumorigenesis is array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH . Although copy number analysis using DNA from FFPE archival tissue is challenging,
  several research groups have reported high quality and reproducible DNA copy number
  results using aCGH. Aim of this study is to compare the commercially available aCGH
  platforms suitable for high-resolution copy number analysis using FFPE-derived DNA.
  Two dual channel aCGH platforms Agilent and NimbleGen and a single channel SNP-based
  platform Affymetrix were evaluated using seven FFPE colon cancer samples, and median
  absolute deviation MAD , deflection, signal-to-noise ratio, and DNA input requirements
  were used as quality criteria. Large differences were observed between platforms
  Agilent and NimbleGen showed better MAD values 0.13 for both compared with Affymetrix
  0.22 . On the contrary, Affymetrix showed a better deflection of 0.94, followed
  by 0.71 for Agilent and 0.51 for NimbleGen. This resulted in signal-to-nose ratios
  that were comparable between the three commercially available platforms. Interestingly,
  DNA input amounts from FFPE material lower than recommended still yielded high quality
  profiles on all platforms. Copy number analysis using DNA derived from FFPE archival
  material is feasible using all three high-resolution copy number platforms and shows
  reproducible results, also with DNA input amounts lower than recommended.
