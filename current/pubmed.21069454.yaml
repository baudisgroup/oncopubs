abstract: Although poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 PARP1 inhibition is a recent promising
  therapy in breast cancer, PARP1 expression in this disease is not known. Using DNA
  microarray and array-based comparative genomic hybridization arrayCGH , we examined
  PARP1 mRNA expression and copy number alterations in 326 invasive breast cancer
  samples and normal breast NB samples. A meta-analysis was performed on a large public
  retrospective gene expression data set n 2,485 to analyze correlation between PARP1
  mRNA expression and molecular subtypes and clinico-pathological parameters. PARP1
  was overexpressed in 58 of cancers, and its expression was heterogeneous between
  tumors. ArrayCGH data revealed an association between mRNA overexpression and gain
  amplification at the PARP1 locus P amp lt 1.0E-8 . Meta-analysis showed that PARP1
  expression was higher in basal breast cancers P amp lt 1.0E-72 , but overexpression
  was also found in other subtypes. PARP1 expression correlated with high grade, medullary
  histological type, tumor size, and worse metastasis-free survival MFS HR 1.12 1.04-1.22
  , P 0.004 and overall survival OS HR 1.16 1.04-1.29 , P 0.006 . In multivariate
  analysis, PARP1 expression had an independent prognostic value for MFS, which was
  restricted to patients untreated with any adjuvant chemotherapy. These data demonstrate
  overexpression of PARP1 in a large number of breast cancers and support the development
  of PARP inhibitors in basal subtype, but also potentially in other breast cancer
  subtypes.
