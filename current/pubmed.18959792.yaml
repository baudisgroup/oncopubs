abstract: Accurate staging of rectal tumors is essential for making the correct treatment
  choice. In a previous study, we found that loss of 17p, 18q and gain of 8q, 13q
  and 20q could distinguish adenoma from carcinoma tissue and that gain of 1q was
  related to lymph node metastasis. In order to find markers for tumor staging, we
  searched for candidate genes on these specific chromosomes.
