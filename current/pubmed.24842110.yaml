abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Synovial sarcoma (SynSa) is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor,
  comprising approximately 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Over half of SynSa patients
  develop metastasis or local recurrence, but the underlying molecular mechanisms
  of the aggressive clinical behavior remain poorly characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  Sixty-four frozen tumor specimens from 54 SynSa patients were subjected to array
  comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling. The examined
  set of tumor specimens included 16 primary tumors from untreated patients who did
  not develop metastasis/local recurrence (SynSa1 group), 26 primary tumors from untreated
  patients who developed metastases or local recurrence during follow-up (SynSa2 group),
  and 22 metachronous metastatic/recurrent SynSa tumors (SynSa3 group). RESULTS: AURKA
  and KIF18A, which play important roles in various mitotic events, were the two most
  up-regulated genes in SynSa2 and SynSa3 groups compared to the SynSa1 group. Expression
  profiles of SynSa2 and SynSa3 tumors did not show any significant differences. Analysis
  of genomic index (GI) based on aCGH profiles demonstrated that the SynSa1 group
  consisted of tumors with significantly less complex genomes compared to SynSa2 and
  SynSa3 groups. There was no significant difference in genome complexity between
  SynSa2 and SynSa3 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Primary SynSa tumors from patients who develop
  metastases or local recurrence share common molecular features with metastatic/recurrent
  tumors. Presented data suggest that the aggressive clinical SynSa behavior is determined
  early in tumorigenesis and might be related to impaired regulation of mitotic mechanisms.
