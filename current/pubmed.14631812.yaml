abstract: Comparative genomic hybridisation CGH allows to detect genetic abnormalities
  associated with poor prognosis in subset of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  DLBCL . Amplification of 2p13-16 represents an adverse genetic sign especially in
  extranodal DLBCL. In the present case, 2p13-16 amplification was revealed by CGH
  in extranodal DLBCL. It was localized in the mesentery and remained resistant to
  the chemotherapy CHOP . A patient, 72-year-old female, died 10 weeks after the diagnosis
  had been made. Rapid lethal course of the disease confirms poor outlook for patients
  with 2p13-16 and supports a role of CGH as a sensitive method in prognosis for patients
  with DLBCL.
