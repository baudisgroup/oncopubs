abstract: Apart from the RET proto-oncogene RET no other genes have been found to
  be involved in medullary thyroid carcinoma MTC tumorigenesis. Germline RET mutations
  are seen virtually in all familial forms of MTC and somatic RET mutations are often
  detected in sporadic MTC. In sporadic MTCs the RET gene is mutated in codon 918,
  where a methionine is substituted to a threonine M918T . In this study 24 MTCs were
  analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH for chromosomal imbalances. Overall,
  alterations were detected in approximately 60 of the samples. The most common aberrations
  were gains on chromosome 19q 29 , 19p 21 , 11c-q12 12.5 , and 22q 12.5 and losses
  on 13q21 21 and 3q23-qter 12.5 . Gain of chromosome 11c-q12 was only detected in
  samples from patients whom died of MTC p 0.001 . These MTCs also harbored the somatic
  RET M918T mutation and also showed the highest numbers of CGH alterations in the
  series p amp lt 0.003 . Although there was a tendency towards a higher number of
  CGH imbalances in the tumors with RET M918T mutation, this difference was not significant.
  The results indicate that MTC is a comparatively genetically stable tumor, and that
  chromosomal regions 19q, 19p, 13q and 11q may be involved in MTC carcinogenesis.
