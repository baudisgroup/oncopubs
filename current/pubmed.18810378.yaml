abstract: It is well established that genetic alterations may be associated to prognosis
  in tumor patients. This study investigates chromosomal changes that predict the
  clinical outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC and correlate to
  characteristic clinicopathological parameters. We applied comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to tissue samples from 117 HNSCC patients scheduled for radiotherapy. Genomic
  aberrations occurring in more than five patients were studied for impact on locoregional
  progression LRP -free survival. p values were adjusted by the Hochberg-Benjamini
  procedure and significant aberrations and clinical variables subjected to a stepwise
  backwards Cox proportional model. Significant alterations were further analyzed
  by array-CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . In multivariate survival
  analysis gains on 1q and 16q predict reduced LRP-free survival independently from
  known prognostic factors. Cluster analysis separated the HNSCC cases into two groups
  cluster 1 and 2 that are characterized by significant differences for imbalances
  in 13 chromosomal regions. Moreover, it became apparent that cluster 1 correlates
  to nonanemic patients, while cluster 2 represents predominantly anemic cases. Array-CGH
  pinpoints 16q24.3 to be the region of interest on chromosome 16 which was further
  verified by FISH analysis where an increased copy number of FANCA, a member of the
  Fanconi anemia breast cancer pathway, could be identified. This study demonstrates
  that chromosomal gains on 1q and 16q as well as chromosomal loss on 18q represent
  prognostic markers in HNSCC and that these alterations may explain to some extent
  the dismal course of a subgroup of patients.
