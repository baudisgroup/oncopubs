abstract: Bilharzia-associated bladder cancer BAC is a major health problem in countries
  where urinary schistosomiasis is endemic. Characterization of the genetic alterations
  in this cancer might enhance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of the
  disease but, in contrast to nonbilharzia bladder cancer, BAC has rarely been the
  object of such scrutiny. In the present study, we aimed to characterize chromosomal
  imbalances in benign and malignant post-bilharzial lesions, and to determine whether
  their unique etiology yields a distinct cytogenetic profile as compared to chemically
  induced bladder tumors.
