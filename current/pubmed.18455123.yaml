abstract: The transition of ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS to invasive carcinoma is
  a poorly understood key event in breast tumor progression. Here, we analyzed the
  role of myoepithelial cells and fibroblasts in the progression of in situ carcinomas
  using a model of human DCIS and primary breast tumors. Progression to invasion was
  promoted by fibroblasts and inhibited by normal myoepithelial cells. Molecular profiles
  of isolated luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells identified an intricate interaction
  network involving TGFbeta, Hedgehog, cell adhesion, and p63 required for myoepithelial
  cell differentiation, the elimination of which resulted in loss of myoepithelial
  cells and progression to invasion.
