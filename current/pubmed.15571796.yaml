abstract: Array-comparative genomic hybridization a-CGH is a molecular cytogenetic
  technique for detection of multiple chromosomal abnormalities in genomic DNA samples.
  Using an a-CGH with 287 probes, we examined 14 cases of breast infiltrating ductal
  carcinoma IDCA that had previously been classified by fluorescent in situ hybridization
  FISH as either human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive HER2 or HER2- and
  analyzed the data by hierarchical, K-means, and principal component analyses. The
  aim of the study was to identify the genetic abnormalities that are present in breast
  IDCAs and determine if the global status of 287 cytogenetic locations could be used
  as a more objective method for breast IDCA classification. Concordance between FISH
  and a-CGH at the HER2 locus was 78.6 11 14 . In general, a-CGH detected more abnormalities
  in HER2 cases. In HER 2 cases, chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 17, and 20 had more regions
  that showed statistically significant P amp lt or 0.01 changes in DNA copy number.
  Among all the aberrant cytogenetic locations detected, 20q13, 7p12.3 approximately
  p12.1, and 17q23.2 approximately q25.3, which contain among others, genes for TNFRSF6B,
  EGFR, and TK1 showed statistically significant gains P amp lt or 0.01 in 83, 66.7,
  and 50 of the HER2 IDCA cases, respectively. Chromosome location 8q24.12 approximately
  q24.13 was the only region that showed consistent amplification in approximately
  50 of the HER2- cases. Unsupervised hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses and
  principal component analysis using the DNA copy number status of 287 cytogenetic
  locations or the 177 cytogenetic locations that showed statistically significant
  differences revealed a cluster consisting of mainly HER2- IDCA cases. Even though
  this study demonstrates the usefulness of a-CGH in the rapid identification of aberrant
  DNA regions in tumor samples, we conclude that an array-CGH with more than 287 probes
  will be needed for a more precise mapping of DNA aberrations at the global level.
