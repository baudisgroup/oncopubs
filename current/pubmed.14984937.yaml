abstract: Malignant primitive neuroectodermal tumor PNET originating from the ovary
  rather than from the central nervous system is extremely rare. The aim of this study
  is to demonstrate the chromosomal abnormalities in a case of peripheral primitive
  neuroectodermal tumor PPNET arising from the ovary of a girl.
