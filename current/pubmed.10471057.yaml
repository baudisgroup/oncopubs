abstract: Thirty-five hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs associated with hepatitis C virus
  HCV were analysed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , to screen for changes
  in copy-number of DNA sequences. Chromosomal losses were noted in 1p34-36 37 , 4q12-21
  48 , 5q13-21 35 , 6q13-16 23 , 8p21-23 28 , 13q 20 , 16q 33 and 17p13 37 . Gains
  were noted in 1q 46 , 6p 20 , 8q21-24 31 and 17q 43 . High level gains indicative
  of gene amplifications were found in 7q31 3 , 11q13 3 , 14q12 6 and 17q12 3 amplification
  at 14q12 may be characteristic for HCCs. No significant difference in chromosomal
  aberrations was noted between carcinomas associated with HCV-infection in our study
  and those reported earlier in HCCs infected with hepatitis B virus HBV , indicating
  that both HBV- and HCV-related carcinomas may progress through a similar cascade
  of molecular events.
