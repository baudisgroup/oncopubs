abstract: Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide
  substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation.
  The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale
  multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and
  to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim
  integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations
  in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide
  sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new
  insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the
  phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a
  network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore,
  integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link
  between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch
  repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical
  implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA,
  demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.

notes: The original data was submitted to the TCGA Data Coordinating Center. Data
  represented in Progenetix is from 223 cases identified in the TCGA FTP archive (ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov:21/tcga/tumor/gbm/cgcc),
  analyzed at the MSKCC using Agilent 244k genomic arrays (accessed 2008-09-16). Aberrant
  genomic intervals were derived from the regions files, with fusion of duplicate
  experiments as guessed from the sample IDs. Some filtering for apparently systematic
  errors (14q11, 15q11 ...) was performed.
