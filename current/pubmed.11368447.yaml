abstract: 'To analyze the genomic differences between multiple myeloma MM and plasma
  cell leukemia PCL , a total of 30 cases were studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . In five cases with a low proportion of plasma cells PC in bone marrow, an
  enrichment of PC was performed by using immunomagnetic beads conjugated with the
  monoclonal antibody B-B4. In 24 out of the 25 MM 96 and in all five PCL 100 patients
  DNA copy number changes were identified by CGH analysis in the MM case without chromosomal
  imbalances, the immunomagnetic enrichment of PC had failed. The most recurrent changes
  in MM patients were gains at chromosomes 15q 48 , 11q 44 , 3q 40 , 9q 40 and 1q
  36 . By contrast, all PCL patients showed gains in 1q. Losses of chromosomal material
  were significantly more frequent in PCL than in MM patients P 0.03 : losses on 13q
  in 80 of PCL vs 28 of MM and on chromosome 16 in 80 vs 12 , respectively. In addition,
  PCL patients showed losses of 2q and 6p that were not present in MM. The CGH data
  show differences in chromosomal imbalances between MM and PCL.'
