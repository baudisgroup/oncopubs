abstract: 'Invasive head and neck squamous carcinomas are among the cytogenetically
  most complex tumors. Perhaps for this reason, there is little consensus on the prognostic
  value of specific chromosomal aberrations. Here we present results of CGH analysis
  of 56 clinically well-characterized set of head and neck cancers, consisting of
  larynx and pharynx only. The aim was to find possible associations with clinical
  outcome. The major chromosome arms showing gains were in decreasing order : 3q,
  7q, 8q, 5p, 11q13, 17q and 18p, and losses occurred at 3p, 11qter, 4p, 18q, and
  5q. The segments most frequently amplified were 3q26-qter, 11q13, 11q22, 3q12-13,
  18p11.3, 18q11.2 and 8q24.3. Tumors with stages III and IV, and lymph node positive
  tumors had a worse clinical outcome. Surprisingly, no specific chromosomal abnormality
  correlated with disease-free survival. The only aberration that correlated to one
  of the clinico-pathological parameters was amplification 11q13, that occurred solely
  in lymph node positive, stage IV tumors. However 11q13 amplification did not correlate
  with disease-free survival. These results seem to indicate that genetic alterations
  at the level of chromosomes have limited prognostic value in patients with invasive
  larynx and pharynx squamous cell carcinomas.'
