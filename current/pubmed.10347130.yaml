abstract: To elucidate cytogenetic alterations underlying human hepatocellular carcinomas
  HCCs , we used a comparative genomic hybridization CGH method to analyze 41 cases
  of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC including 15 well differentiated HCCs, 14 moderately
  differentiated HCCs, and 12 poorly differentiated HCCs. Of these, 27 patients were
  chronically infected with hepatitis C virus HCV , and the remaining patients were
  positive for hepatitis B virus HBV . The most common sites of increase in DNA copy
  number were 1q 78 of the cases and 8q 66 with minimal overlapping regions at 1q24-25
  and 8q24, respectively. Frequent decreases in copy number were observed at 17p 51
  , 16q 46 , 13q13-14 37 , 4q13-22 32 , 8p 29 , and 10q 17 . In 6 cases 15 , an amplification
  was found in the region of 11q13. A gain of 8q24 was significantly associated with
  well-differentiated HCCs P amp lt .05 , whereas a loss of 13q13-14 and amplification
  of 11q13 were linked to moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs P amp lt .01 .
  These observations suggest that a gain of 8q24 is an early event and that a loss
  of 13q13-14 and amplification of 11q13 are a late event in the course of liver carcinogenesis.
  A gain of 10q 7 41 was detected exclusively in cases with HCV infection. In contrast,
  an amplification of 11q13 was preferentially found in HBV-positive HCCs. These findings
  raise the hypothesis that, although many genetic alterations are basically common
  to both HCV-positive and HBV-positive tumors, the process of carcinogenesis may
  be to some extent different between these two types of tumors.
