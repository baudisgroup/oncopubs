abstract: 'Single-cell polymerase chain reaction PCR has been used as a tool to demonstrate
  clonality and B-cell origin of Reed-Sternberg RS cells in Hodgkin disease HD . An
  analogous approach was used to investigate genomic imbalances in a cyto genetically
  poorly characterized subentity: lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin disease LPHD . Nineteen
  cases of LPHD were selected for a comparative genomic hybridization CGH study. CGH
  was performed with degenerate oligonucleotide primed-PCR DOP-PCR -amplified DNA
  from 4-5 microdissected CD20 malignant cells. All analyzed cases revealed a high
  number of genomic imbalances average 10.8 per case , involving all chromosomes but
  the excluded 19, 22, and Y, indicating a high complexity of LPHD. The majority of
  detected aberrations were recurrent. Gain of 1, 2q, 3, 4q, 5q, 6, 8q, 11q, 12q,
  and X, and loss of chromosome 17 were identified in 36.8 to 68.4 of the analyzed
  cases. Some of them have also been found in non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL , and possibly
  represent secondary changes associated with disease progression. Gain of 2q, 4q,
  5q, 6, 11q, however, are much more rarely observed in NHL and could be more specifically
  associated with LPHD. Particularly interesting is a frequent overrepresentation
  of chromosome arm 6q, a region usually deleted in NHL. Rearrangement of the BCL6
  gene 3q27 demonstrated by cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization in
  2 cases in this study suggests its contribution in pathogenesis of LPHD. In conclusion,
  the data show a consistent occurrence of genomic alterations in LPHD and highlight
  genomic regions that might be relevant for development and or progression of this
  lymphoma entity.'
