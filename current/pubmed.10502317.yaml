abstract: We used arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction AP-PCR fingerprinting
  to identify chromosomal imbalances in six primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas PMBLs
  . Seventy-four chromosomal imbalances were detected, consisting of 49 sequence gains
  and 25 losses. Amplifications on chromosome X were seen in five cases, four of which
  involved the same chromosomal locus. Nonrandom gains at the same locus were also
  identified on chromosomes 2 and 7 in four cases and on chromosomes 5, 9, and 12
  in three cases. Five PMBLs were also analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , which found chromosome arm 9p amplification as the only nonrandom imbalance.
  Our data demonstrate that chromosomal amplifications outnumber losses in PMBL. These
  mainly involve chromosomes 9 and X and may reflect more complex phenomena, such
  as translocations or other chromosomal rearrangements, as AP-PCR found coexistent
  gains and losses on these chromosomes. Comparison between AP-PCR and CGH suggests
  that anomalies affecting the same chromosomal regions may occur at much higher frequencies
  than expected by CGH, suggesting that genomic amplifications are usually confined
  to DNA segments smaller than the megabase long segments required for detection in
  CGH. Modest increases in genetic material may be as effective as higher-level amplifications
  when affecting sites where a proto-oncogene resides.
