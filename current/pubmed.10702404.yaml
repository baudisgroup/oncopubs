abstract: DNA copy number changes were investigated in 69 samples of schistosoma-associated
  SA and non-schistosoma-associated NSA squamous cell carcinoma SCC and transitional
  cell carcinoma TCC of the bladder by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . DNA
  copy number changes were detected in 47 tumors. SA tumors had more changes than
  NSA tumors mean, 7 vs. 4 , whereas the number of changes in SCC and TCC tumors was
  similar. SA tumors displayed more gains than losses 1.7:1 , whereas NSA tumors showed
  an equal number of gains and losses. Changes that were observed at similar frequencies
  in SCC and TCC, irrespective of the schistosomal status, included gains and high-level
  amplifications at 1q, 8q, and 20q and losses in 9p and 13q. These changes may be
  involved in a common pathway for bladder tumor development and progression independent
  of schistosomal status or histological subtype. Losses in 3p and gains at 5p were
  seen only in SCC P amp lt 0.01 and losses in 5q were more frequent in SA-SCC than
  in other tumors P amp lt 0.05 . However, changes that were more frequent in TCC
  than those in SCC included gains at 17q P amp lt 0.01 and losses in 4q P amp lt
  0.05 and 6q P amp lt 0.01 . Gains and high-level amplifications at 5p were seen
  only in SA-SCC P amp lt 0. 01 , whereas gains and high-level amplifications with
  minimal common overlapping regions at 11q13 were more frequently seen both in SA-SCC
  and SA-TCC tumors P amp lt 0.01 . In addition to the above mentioned alterations,
  several other changes were also seen at lower frequencies. The variations in the
  DNA copy number changes observed in TCC, SCC, SA, and NSA bladder carcinomas suggest
  that these tumors have different genetic pathways.
