abstract: Pathogenesis of gastric cancer is driven by an accumulation of genetic changes
  that to a large extent occur at the chromosomal level. In order to investigate the
  patterns of chromosomal aberrations in gastric carcinomas, we performed genome-wide
  microarray based comparative genomic hybridisation microarray CGH . With this recently
  developed technique chromosomal aberrations can be studied with high resolution
  and sensitivity.
