abstract: Recent molecular genetic studies have revealed that two major types of genomic
  instabilities, chromosomal instability and microsatellite instability, exist in
  the colorectal carcinomas. To clarify the relationship between chromosomal abnormalities
  and mismatch repair gene defects in colorectal carcinomas, we performed a chromosomal
  analysis on 39 colorectal carcinomas with high-microsatellite instability MSI-H
  and compared the results obtained with those of 20 right-sided microsatellite-stable
  MSS colorectal carcinomas. Chromosomal imbalances CIs in MSS colorectal carcinomas
  were more frequent than in MSI-H colon carcinomas by comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis 70 versus 31 , P 0.004 . The CI patterns of MSI-H and MSS carcinomas were
  different. Frequent CIs in MSI-H colon carcinomas were gains of 4q 15 and 8q 8 ,
  and losses of 9q 21 , 1p 18 , and 11q 18 . In contrast, frequent CIs in right-sided
  MSS colon carcinomas were gains of 8q 50 , 13q 35 , and 20q 25 , and losses of 18q
  55 , 15q 35 , and 17p 30 . We compared the mutation status of 45 target genes and
  CIs in our MSI-H tumors. Among these 45 target genes, mutation of hRAD50, a member
  of the DNA repair genes, and FLJ11383 were significantly related to MSI-H colorectal
  carcinomas with CIs P 0.01 and P 0.02, respectively . Our findings indicate that
  unique CIs were present in a subset of MSI-H colorectal carcinomas and that these
  CIs are related to the mutation of several target genes, especially of hRAD50.
