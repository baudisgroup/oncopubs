abstract: It is difficult to evaluate the prognostic value of histologic criteria
  in gastric cancer because of the high variability of morphologic patterns. Recently,
  histologic subtypes of low, intermediate, or high malignant potential have been
  identified, providing the basis for a prognostically informative grading system.
  Because array comparative genomic hybridization systems allow systematic analysis
  of chromosome alterations, which may be prognostically and pathogenetically informative,
  we applied high-resolution genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization to
  archival material from 81 gastric cancer cases followed for a median of 150 months
  after surgery. The DNA extracted from paraffin sections gave useful results in 49
  tumors, 18 of which were of low-grade, 24 of intermediate, and 7 of high-grade histotypes.
  Based on the number of chromosome aberrations and the presence absence of amplifications,
  3 tumor clusters of increasing genomic lesion severity were constructed, which proved
  to correlate significantly with histologic grade and stage as well as with patient
  survival. Further investigation documented the lower number and severity of genomic
  alterations in tumors with microsatellite DNA instability and high CD8-rich lymphoid
  response the close association of 8p23.1 amplification with cardial cancer the frequent
  amplification of genes involved in cell renewal CDC6, HER2, GRB7, IGFBP4 at 17q12-q21.1,
  with close histochemical correlation with HER2 membranous expression and more sporadic
  amplification of chromosome regions harboring important oncogenes like MYC, KRAS,
  NRAS, CRKL, CCNE1, or ZNF217. We conclude that genome-wide array comparative genomic
  hybridization of gastric cancer contributes prognostically relevant information
  providing a genetic background for histologic grading.
