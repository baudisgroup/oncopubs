abstract: Normal karyotype NK is the most common cytogenetic group in acute myeloid
  leukemia AML diagnosis however, up to 50 of these patients at relapse will have
  aberrant karyotype AK AML. To determine the etiology of relapsed AK AML cells, we
  evaluated cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular results of 17 patients with
  diagnostic NK AML and relapsed AK AML at our institute. AK AML karyotype was diverse,
  involving no favorable and largely 8 of 17 complex cytogenetics. Despite clear cytogenetic
  differences, immunophenotype and NPM1 FLT3 gene mutation status did not change between
  presentation and relapse in 83 10 of 12 and 94 15 of 16 cases, respectively. High-resolution
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH performed via paired aCGH on
  NK AML and AK AML samples from the same patient confirmed cytogenetic aberrations
  only in the relapse sample. Analysis of 16 additional diagnostic NK AML samples
  revealed no evidence of submicroscopic aberrations undetected by conventional cytogenetics
  in any case. These results favor evolution of NK AML leukemia cells with acquisition
  of novel genetic changes as the most common etiology of AK AML relapse as opposed
  to secondary leukemogenesis. Additional studies are needed to confirm whether AK
  AML cells represent selection of rare preexisting clones below aCGH detection and
  to further characterize the molecular lesions found at time of AK AML relapse.
