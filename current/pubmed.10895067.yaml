abstract: Genetic abnormalities were detected by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in 12 ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas. DNA sequence copy number abnormalities
  CNAs occurring in more than 20 of the cancers included increased copy numbers of
  8q11-q13, 8q21-q22, 8q23, 8q24-qter, 17q25-qter, 20q13-qter and 21q22-qter and reduced
  copy numbers of 19p. Increases in copy numbers of 8q11-q13, 8q21-q22, 8q23 and 8q24-qter
  occurred more frequently in disease-free patients than in recurrent non-surviving
  patients p amp lt 0.05 . However, increases in copy numbers of 17q25-qter and 20q13-qter
  occurred more frequently in recurrent non-surviving patients than in disease-free
  patients p amp lt 0.05 . Furthermore, increases in copy numbers of 17q25-qter and
  20q13-qter occurred together p amp lt 0.05 . Additionally, there were negative correlations
  between increases in copy numbers of 8q21-q22 and 17q25-qter, and between 8q21-q22
  and 20q13-qter p amp lt 0.05 . It appears that ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas
  can be classified into two subtypes, one being cancer with an increase in copy numbers
  of 8q and the other being cancer with increases in copy numbers of 17q25-qter and
  20q13-qter.
