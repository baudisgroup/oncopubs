abstract: Raf kinase inhibitory protein RKIP also known as PEBP, for phosphatidylethanolamine-binding
  protein is an endogenous inhibitor of the Raf- MAPK kinase MEK -MAP kinase pathway.
  It has emerged as a significant metastasis suppressor in a variety of human cancers
  including colorectal cancer CRC and was recently shown to regulate the spindle checkpoint
  in cultured cells. This study aims at correlating RKIP expression with chromosomal
  instability in colorectal cancer samples and identifies possible mechanisms of RKIP
  loss.
