abstract: 'Here we tested the prognostic impact of genomic alterations in operable
  localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC . Fifty-two formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
  primary PDAC were laser micro-dissected and were investigated by comparative genomic
  hybridization after whole genome amplification using an adapter-linker PCR. Chromosomal
  gains and losses were correlated to clinico-pathological parameters and clinical
  follow-up data. The most frequent aberration was loss on chromosome 17p 65 while
  the most frequent gains were detected at 2q 41 and 8q 41 , respectively. The concomitant
  occurrence of losses at 9p and 17p was found to be statistically significant. Higher
  rates of chromosomal losses were associated with a more advanced primary tumor stage
  and losses at 9p and 18q were significantly associated with presence of lymphatic
  metastasis chi-square: p 0.03, p 0.05, respectively . Deletions on chromosome 4
  were of prognostic significance for overall survival and tumor recurrence Cox-multivariate
  analysis: p 0.026 and p 0.021, respectively . In conclusion our data suggest the
  common alterations at chromosome 8q, 9p, 17p and 18q as well as the prognostic relevant
  deletions on chromosome 4q as relevant for PDAC progression. Our comprehensive data
  from 52 PDAC should provide a basis for future studies with a higher resolution
  to discover the relevant genes located within the chromosomal aberrations identified.'
