abstract: Common fragile sites cFS represent chromosomal regions that are prone to
  breakage after partial inhibition of DNA synthesis. Activation of cFS is associated
  with various forms of DNA instability in cancer cells, and is thought to be an initiating
  event in the generation of DNA damage in early-stage tumorigenesis. Only a few cFS
  have been fully characterized despite the growing interest in cFS instability in
  cancer genomes. In this study, six-color fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed
  that FRA2C consists of two cFS spanning 747 kb FRA2Ctel and 746 kb FRA2Ccen at 2p24.3
  and 2p24.2, respectively. Both cFS are separated by a 2.8 Mb non-fragile region
  containing MYCN. Fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization of MYCN amplicons
  from neuroblastoma NB cell lines and primary tumors revealed that 56.5 of the amplicons
  cluster in FRA2C. MYCN amplicons are either organized as double minutes or as homogeneously
  stained regions in addition to the single copy of MYCN retained at 2p24. We suggest
  that MYCN amplicons arise from extra replication rounds of unbroken DNA secondary
  structures that accumulate at FRA2C. This hypothesis implicates cFS in high-level
  gene amplification in cancer cells. Complex genomic rearrangements, including deletions,
  duplications and translocations, which originate from double-strand breaks, were
  detected at FRA2C in different cancers. These data propose a dual role for cFS in
  the generation of gross chromosomal rearrangements either after DNA breakage or
  by inducing extra replication rounds, and provide new insights into the highly recombinogenic
  nature of cFS in the human cancer genome.
