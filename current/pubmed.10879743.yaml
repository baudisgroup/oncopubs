abstract: 'Despite the high incidence of prostate cancer, only limited data are available
  on genes or chromosomes specifically involved in its initiation and progression.
  We have applied comparative genomic hybridization to routinely processed, paraffin-embedded,
  tissues at different times in prostatic tumor progression to screen the tumor genome
  for gains and losses. Our panel included specimens derived from 56 different patients:
  23 patients with primary, prostate-confined carcinomas 18 patients with regional
  lymph node metastases and 15 patients with distant metastases. Chromosome arms that
  most frequently showed losses, included 13q 55 , 8p 48 , 6q 43 , 5q 32 , 16q 25
  , 18q 20 , 2q 18 , 4q 18 , 10q 18 , and Y 16 . Gains were often seen of chromosome
  arms 8q 36 , 17q 23 , Xq 23 , 7q 21 , 3q 18 , 9q 18 , 1q 16 , Xp 16 . Furthermore,
  specific high-level amplifications, eg, of 1q21, 1q25, and Xq12 to q13, were found
  in metastatic cancers. A significant accumulation of genetic changes in distant
  metastases was observed, eg, loss of 10q p 0.03 and gain of 7q p 0.03 sequences.
  In addition, investigation of a potential biomarker identified in previous studies
  by our group, ie, extra copies of 7 and or 8, revealed a high prevalence of 7pq
  and or 8q gain in the distant metastases p 0.02 . Importantly, gains were observed
  more frequently in tumors derived from progressors after radical prostatectomy,
  than in nonprogressors mean time of follow-up, 74 months . Specifically, gain of
  chromosome 7pq and or 8q sequences appeared an accurate discriminator between the
  progressors and nonprogressors. Multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation
  between progressive disease and the number of chromosomes with gains. This correlation
  also held true when stage p 0.007 or grade p 0.002 were taken into account. Likewise,
  this applied for gain of chromosome 7pq and or 8q sequences p 0.03 and p 0.005 for
  stage or grade, respectively . Additionally, an increase in the number of chromosomes
  with gains per case was related to a decrease in biochemical progression-free survival
  Ptrend amp lt 0.001 . More specifically, the gain of 7pq and or 8q sequences markedly
  reduced the biochemical progression-free survival p amp lt 0.001 . In conclusion,
  this study has, firstly, documented the spectrum of chromosomal alterations in subsequent
  stages of prostate cancer, a number of which had not been described previously.
  It allowed us to identify chromosomal regions related to advanced tumor stage, ie,
  loss of 10q24 and gain of 7q11.2 and or 7q31 sequences. Secondly, gain of 7pq and
  or 8q was identified as a potential genetic discriminator between progressors and
  nonprogressors after radical surgery.'
