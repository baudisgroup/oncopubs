abstract: 'For many oncogenes, increased expression resulting from copy number gain
  confers a selective advantage to cells that consequently make up the tumour bulk.
  To identify oncogenes of potential biological significance in cervical squamous
  cell carcinoma SCC , 36 primary samples and ten cell lines were screened by array
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The most commonly occurring regions of copy
  number gain that also showed amplification were 5p15.2-14.3 59 , 5p13.3 65 , and
  5p13.2-13.1 63 . Gene copy numbers were significantly associated with expression
  levels for three candidate oncogenes at these loci: OSMR oncostatin M receptor p
  0.03 , PDZK3 PDZ domain containing protein 3 p 0.04 , and TRIO triple functional
  domain p 0.03 . Further examination by fluorescence in situ hybridization on a tissue
  microarray of 110 primary cervical SCC samples revealed copy number gain frequencies
  of 60.9 , 57.3 , and 54.5 for OSMR, PDZK3, and TRIO, respectively, with OSMR adversely
  influencing overall patient survival independently of tumour stage p 0.046 . By
  array CGH, copy number gain of OSMR was not seen in any of 40 microdissected precursor
  cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions SILs . Moreover, global mRNA expression
  analysis, using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 Arrays, showed no overexpression of OSMR in
  SILs, suggesting that OSMR gain and overexpression are relatively late steps in
  cervical carcinogenesis. In the cervical SCC cell lines CaSki and SW756, exogenous
  OSM activated downstream-signalling elements of OSMR including STAT3, p44 42 MAPK,
  and S6 ribosomal protein, and induced transcription of the angiogenic factor VEGF,
  effects that were reduced by OSMR depletion using RNA interference. We conclude
  that copy number gain of OSMR is frequently found in cervical SCC and is associated
  with adverse clinical outcome. As well as being a potential prognostic marker, OSMR
  is a candidate cell surface therapeutic target.'
