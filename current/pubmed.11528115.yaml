abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH has been applied to characterize 61
  primary renal cell carcinomas derived histogenetically from the proximal tubulus.
  The tumor samples comprised 46 clear-cell renal cell carcinomas ccRCCs and 15 papillary
  renal cell carcinomas pRCCs . Changes in the copy number of entire chromosomes or
  subregions were detected in 56 tumors 92 . In ccRCCs, losses of chromosome 3 or
  3p 63 14q 30 9 26 1 and 6 or 6q 17 each 4 and 8 or 8p 15 each 22 11 2 or 2q and
  19 9 each 7q, 10, 16, 17p, 18, and Y 7 each and 5, 11, 13, 15, and 21 4 each were
  detected. Most frequent genomic gains in ccRCC were found on chromosome 5 63 7 35
  1 or 1q 33 2q 24 8 or 8q, 12, and 20 20 each 3q 17 16 15 19 13 6 and 17 or 17q 11
  each and 4, 10, 11, 21, and Y 9 each . In pRCCs, gains in the copy number of chromosomes
  7 and 17 7 15, each and 16 and 20 6 15, each were frequent. One pRCC showed amplification
  of subchromosome regions 2q22-- amp gt q33, 16q, 17q and the entire X chromosome.
  In pRCC, losses were less frequently seen than gains. Losses of chromosomes 1, 14,
  15, and Y 3 15 each and 2, 4, 6, and 13 2 15 each were observed. In ccRCCs, statistical
  evaluation revealed significant correlations of chromosomal imbalances with tumor
  stage and grade, i.e., a gain in copy number of chromosome 5 correlated positively
  with low tumor grade, whereas a gain of chromosomes 10 and 17 correlated positively
  with high tumor grade. Furthermore, loss of chromosome 4 correlated positively with
  high tumor stage.
