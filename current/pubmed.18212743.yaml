abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death, where the amplification
  of oncogenes contributes to tumorigenesis. Genomic profiling of 128 lung cancer
  cell lines and tumors revealed frequent focal DNA amplification at cytoband 14q13.3,
  a locus not amplified in other tumor types. The smallest region of recurrent amplification
  spanned the homeobox transcription factor TITF1 thyroid transcription factor 1 also
  called NKX2-1 , previously linked to normal lung development and function. When
  amplified, TITF1 exhibited increased expression at both the RNA and protein levels.
  Small interfering RNA siRNA -mediated knockdown of TITF1 in lung cancer cell lines
  with amplification led to reduced cell proliferation, manifested by both decreased
  cell-cycle progression and increased apoptosis. Our findings indicate that TITF1
  amplification and overexpression contribute to lung cancer cell proliferation rates
  and survival and implicate TITF1 as a lineage-specific oncogene in lung cancer.
