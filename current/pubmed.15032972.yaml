abstract: A thorough cytogenetic investigation and an analysis of detailed questionnaires
  were performed in a family with three brothers afflicted with germ-cell tumors GCTs
  , in an attempt to detect a congenital factor related either to a hereditary genetic
  background or an environmental lifestyle influence. One brother had an intracranial
  tumor in the pineal region and the two others had testicular tumors. Peripheral
  blood was studied by traditional karyotyping, multicolor-FISH, high-resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization HR-CGH , and molecular analysis of selected loci on sex chromosomes
  Yq11 region, TSPY, and the androgen receptor gene however, no abnormalities were
  detected. The HR-CGH analysis of microdissected histological components of the overt
  tumors and the adjacent carcinoma in situ demonstrated a pattern of genomic imbalances
  characteristic for sporadic GCTs, including gain of 12p. The questionnaire and interview
  revealed a history of different cancers in the extended family, and a possible in
  utero and or infantile exposure of the three brothers with GCTs to compounds suspected
  of endocrine-disrupting properties. Although no genetic aberration was detected
  in this family, we suspect the presence of a recessive hereditary factor pre-disposing
  to cancer, which probably was manifested as GCTs in the three brothers because of
  an adverse effect of an environmental factor on the early germ-cell differentiation.
