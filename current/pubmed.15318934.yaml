abstract: Cyclin E, a G1 cyclin essential for G1-S phase transition, is known to have
  a profound effect on tumorigenesis. Elevated levels of cyclin E have been associated
  with breast cancer, and chromosomal instability observed in breast cancer is suggested
  to be associated with constitutive expression of cyclin E. It was previously demonstrated
  that SUM149PT human breast cancer cells show very high levels of cyclin E expression
  by western analysis and that they express a nonfunctional cyclin E ubiquitin ligase
  due to a mutation in the F-box protein hCdc4.
