abstract: Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck show frequent and complex
  chromosome aberrations, but little is known about the changes that occur during
  the metastatic process. To compare the accumulation of changes in primary and metastatic
  tumors we analyzed 19 pairs of primary larynx cancer tumors and their metastases.
  The most frequent changes were found at 3p, 3q, 5p, 9, and 13. Losses at 13, 8p,
  and 9q were more frequent in metastases than in primary tumors.
