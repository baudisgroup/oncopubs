abstract: 'The impact of different carcinogenic exposures on the specific patterns
  of somatic mutation in human tumors remains unclear. To address this issue, we profiled
  209 cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) from Asia and Europe, including 108 cases caused
  by infection with the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini and 101 cases caused by
  non-O. viverrini-related etiologies. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 15) and prevalence
  screening (n = 194) identified recurrent somatic mutations in BAP1 and ARID1A, neither
  of which, to our knowledge, has previously been reported to be mutated in CCA. Comparisons
  between intrahepatic O. viverrini-related and non-O. viverrini-related CCAs demonstrated
  statistically significant differences in mutation patterns: BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2
  were more frequently mutated in non-O. viverrini CCAs, whereas TP53 mutations showed
  the reciprocal pattern. Functional studies demonstrated tumor suppressive functions
  for BAP1 and ARID1A, establishing the role of chromatin modulators in CCA pathogenesis.
  These findings indicate that different causative etiologies may induce distinct
  somatic alterations, even within the same tumor type.'
