abstract: We used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze 10 primary tumor samples
  from patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. The most frequent
  loss was located at 9q, that is, in 50 of the tumors. Gains of DNA sequences were
  most frequently observed in chromosome regions 1q21 approximately q23, 2p23 approximately
  p25, 8q21.1 approximately q22 and in the whole chromosome 20. High level amplifications
  at 1q21 approximately q25, 6p22 approximately p23, 8q21 approximately q22, 8q22
  approximately q24.1, 11q13, and 12q14 approximately q21 were detected. Most of these
  regions have previously been reported to be involved in transitional cell carcinoma
  of the bladder, thus confirming the importance of an increasing number of chromosome
  imbalances in the development and progression of this type of tumors.
