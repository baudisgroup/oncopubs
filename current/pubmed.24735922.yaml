abstract: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are benign liver tumors predominantly developed
  in women using oral contraceptives. Here, exome sequencing identified recurrent
  somatic FRK mutations that induce constitutive kinase activity, STAT3 activation,
  and cell proliferation sensitive to Src inhibitors. We also found uncommon recurrent
  mutations activating JAK1, gp130, or Î²-catenin. Chromosome copy number and methylation
  profiling revealed patterns that correlated with specific gene mutations and tumor
  phenotypes. Finally, integrative analysis of HCAs transformed to hepatocellular
  carcinoma revealed Î²-catenin mutation as an early alteration and TERT promoter
  mutations as associated with the last step of the adenoma-carcinoma transition.
  In conclusion, we identified the genomic diversity in benign hepatocyte proliferation,
  several therapeutic targets, and the key genomic determinants of the adenoma-carcinoma
  transformation sequence.
