abstract: Small cell lung cancer SCLC is a major cause of cancer related morbidity
  and mortality. Karyotypic studies have revealed numerous chromosomal aberrations
  in most SCLC however, classical G-banding analysis is unable to fully characterise
  complex marker chromosomes. Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics now allow
  accurate identification of the chromosomal components of complicated rearrangements.
  We have applied the technique of multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization
  M-FISH in combination with comparative genomic hybridization CGH to the analysis
  of 5 SCLC cell lines and 1 primary tumour specimen to characterise the chromosomal
  abnormalities. CGH analysis identified many similarities between specimens, with
  frequent DNA copy number decreases on chromosomes 3p, 5q, 10, 16q, 17p and frequent
  gains on 3q, 1p, 1q and 14q. In contrast, M-FISH analysis revealed a large number
  of structural abnormalities, with each specimen demonstrating an individual pattern
  of chromosomal translocations. Forty different translocations were identified with
  the vast majority 39 being unbalanced. Chromosome 5 was the most frequently rearranged
  chromosome 9 translocations followed by chromosomes 2, 10 and 16 6 translocations
  each . Further investigation of these frequently involved chromosomes is warranted
  to establish whether consistent break points are involved in these translocations,
  causing dysregulation of specific genes that are crucial for tumour progression
  and secondly to identify the affected genes.
