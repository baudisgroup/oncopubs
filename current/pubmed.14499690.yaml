abstract: Hepatocarcinogenesis may involve multiple mutations with distinctive pathogenetic
  and clinicopathologic significance. To test this hypothesis, 68 cases of hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC were studied prospectively for genetic-clinicopathologic correlation.
  Ten pathologic characteristics were evaluated. TP53 alias p53 gene mutation was
  studied by a polymerase chain reaction PCR -single-strand conformation polymorphism-sequencing
  CDKN2B alias p15 and CDKN2A alias p16 gene methylation by methylation-specific PCR
  and genetic imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . TP53 gene mutations
  occurred in 25 of cases, more than half being codon 249 G to T transversion. Methylation
  of CDKN2A was frequent 61.7 of CDKN2B, rare 5.9 . The CGH analysis showed a median
  of nine aberrations per case, with amplifications more frequent than deletions.
  Isochromosomes might be involved in about 25 of cases. Amplifications of 1q and
  8q were most frequent. Clinicopathologic correlations showed that CDKN2A methylation
  was significantly associated with tumors arising in cirrhotic livers amplifications
  of 17q was significant in multiple parameters of tumor invasiveness size, venous
  invasion, poor cellular differentiation, microsatellite formation other amplifications
  1q, 6p, 10p, and 20p were also significant in tumor invasion and deletions at 1p,
  11q, 4q, and 14q were significant in tumor growth. Consistent patterns of genetic
  alterations were defined in HCC, which might represent distinctive pathways in hepatocarcinogenesis.
