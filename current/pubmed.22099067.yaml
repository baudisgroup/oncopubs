abstract: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the treatment of choice in advanced rectal
  cancer, even though there are many patients who will not benefit from it. There
  are still no effective methods for predicting which patients will respond or not.
  The present study aimed to define the genomic profile of rectal tumors and to identify
  alterations that are predictive of response in order to optimize therapeutic strategies.
