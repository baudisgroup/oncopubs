abstract: Eight cell lines newly established from glioblastoma multiforme were examined
  by comparative genomic hybridization for their patterns of genomic imbalance. The
  total number of DNA copy number alterations CNAs found in the eight cell lines varied
  between 15 and 24. This characterized the examined cell lines or the tumors they
  were derived from as distinctly progressed in karyotypic evolution. The most frequent
  CNAs were gains of the entire chromosome 6 or, at least, parts of it, and of 7p22,
  which were found in all eight cell lines. Other changes present in seven of the
  eight cell lines were gains of 3q26qter and the entire chromosome 7 and losses of
  segments on chromosome 4q e.g., 4q34q35 and of the short arm of chromosome 10. Enh
  3q21q25 , dim 4q22q33 and dim 4qter , dim 13q22 , enh 15q14 , and enh 18q22q23 were
  found in six of the eight cell lines. Several other CNAs e.g., dim 9p21 were found
  in common in five or less of the eight lines. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis,
  the specific patterns of genomic imbalance allowed various groupings of the examined
  cell lines. Although a close relation could be confirmed among all examined lines
  on the basis of shared CNAs, two main groups could be roughly differentiated. Among
  those there were also more or less closely related subgroups. However, also alterations
  which were restricted to one single cell line each were found, e.g., dim 1q41qter
  , dim 2q22qter , enh 4p , dim 5p , dim 4p13pter , dim 8q21qter , enh 9p , dim 9q
  , dim 11p14pter , enh 12q15q23 , enh 13q21 , dim 14q21qter , dim 15q21qter , dim
  19q , and enh 22q . The comparison of the obtained data on gains and losses of DNA
  copy numbers in specific chromosomal segments with the data on localization of genes
  possibly associated with the biology of glioblastoma multiforme additionally shows
  high conformity but also disparity of the examined cell lines among each other,
  as well as compared to primary glioblastoma multiforme. Eventually, each of the
  cell lines could be characterized by its specific pattern of genomic imbalance.
