abstract: 'In defining the genetic profiles in cancer, cytogenetically aberrant cell
  lines derived from primary tumors are important tools for the study of carcinogenesis.
  Here, we present the results of a comprehensive investigation of 15 established
  colorectal cancer cell lines using spectral karyotyping SKY , fluorescence in situ
  hybridization, and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Detailed karyotypic analysis
  by SKY on five of the lines P53HCT116, T84, NCI-H508, NCI-H716, and SK-CO-1 is described
  here for the first time. The five lines with karyotypes in the diploid range and
  that are characterized by defects in DNA mismatch repair had a mean of 4.8 chromosomal
  abnormalities per line, whereas the 10 aneuploid lines exhibited complex karyotypes
  and a mean of 30 chromosomal abnormalities. Of the 150 clonal translocations, only
  eight were balanced and none were recurrent among the lines. We also reviewed the
  karyotypes of 345 cases of adenocarcinoma of the large intestine listed in the Mitelman
  Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer. The types of abnormalities observed
  in the cell lines reflected those seen in primary tumors: there were no recurrent
  translocations in either tumors or cell lines isochromosomes were the most common
  recurrent abnormalities and breakpoints occurred most frequently at the centromeric
  pericentromeric and telomere regions. Of the genomic imbalances detected by array
  CGH, 87 correlated with chromosome aberrations observed in the SKY studies. The
  fact that chromosome abnormalities predominantly result in copy number changes rather
  than specific chromosome or gene fusions suggests that this may be the major mechanism
  leading to carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer.'
