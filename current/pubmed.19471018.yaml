abstract: Follicular lymphoma FL is genetically characterized by the presence of the
  t 14 18 q32 q21 chromosomal translocation in approximately 90 of cases. In contrast
  to FL carrying the t 14 18 , their t 14 18 -negative counterparts are less well
  studied about their immunohistochemical, genetic, molecular, and clinical features.
  Within a previously published series of 184 FLs grades 1 to 3A with available gene
  expression data, we identified 17 FLs lacking the t 14 18 . Comparative genomic
  hybridization and high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array profiling
  showed that gains amplifications of the BCL2 gene locus in 18q were restricted to
  the t 14 18 -positive FL subgroup. A comparison of gene expression profiles showed
  an enrichment of germinal center B cell-associated signatures in t 14 18 -positive
  FL, whereas activated B cell-like, NFkappaB, proliferation, and bystander cell signatures
  were enriched in t 14 18 -negative FL. These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry
  in an independent validation series of 84 FLs, in which 32 of t 14 18 -negative
  FLs showed weak or absent CD10 expression and 91 an increased Ki67 proliferation
  rate. Although overall survival did not differ between FL with and without t 14
  18 , our findings suggest distinct molecular features of t 14 18 -negative FL.
