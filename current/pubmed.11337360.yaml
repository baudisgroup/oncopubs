abstract: We have developed a protocol for degenerate oligonucleotide-primed-polymerase
  chain reaction-based array comparative genomic hybridization array CGH that, when
  combined with a laser microdissection technique, allows the analysis of cancer cell
  populations isolated from routine, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples.
  Comparison of copy number changes detected by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed-polymerase
  chain reaction-based array CGH to those detected by conventional array CGH or fluorescence
  in situ hybridization, demonstrated that amplifications can be reliably detected.
  Using a genomic microarray containing 57 oncogenes, we screened a total of 28 breast
  cancer samples and obtained a detailed amplicon profile that is the most comprehensive
  to date in human breast cancer. The array CGH method described here will allow the
  genetic analysis of paraffin-embedded human cancer materials for example in the
  context of clinical trials.
