abstract: Recurrent genomic aberrations are important prognostic parameters in chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia CLL . High-resolution 10k and 50k Affymetrix SNP arrays were
  evaluated as a diagnostic tool for CLL and revealed chromosomal imbalances in 65.6
  and 81.5 of 70 consecutive cases, respectively. Among the prognostically important
  aberrations, the del13q14 was present in 36 51.4 , trisomy 12 in 9 12.8 , del11q22
  in 9 12.8 , and del17p13 in 4 cases 5.7 . A prominent clustering of breakpoints
  on both sides of the MIRN15A MIRN16-1 genes indicated the presence of recombination
  hot spots in the 13q14 region. Patients with a monoallelic del13q14 had slower lymphocyte
  growth kinetics P .002 than patients with biallelic deletions. In 4 CLL cases with
  unmutated VH genes, a common minimal 3.5-Mb gain of 2p16 spanning the REL and BCL11A
  oncogenes was identified, implicating these genes in the pathogenesis of CLL. Twenty-four
  large amp gt 10 Mb copy-neutral regions with loss of heterozygosity were identified
  in 14 cases. These regions with loss of heterozygosity are not detectable by alternative
  methods and may harbor novel imprinted genes or loss-of-function alleles that may
  be important for the pathogenesis of CLL. Genomic profiling with SNP arrays is a
  convenient and efficient screening method for simultaneous genome-wide detection
  of chromosomal aberrations.
