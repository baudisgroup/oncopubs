abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To investigate associations between WW domain-containing oxidoreductase
  WWOX , runt-related transcription factor 2 RUNX2 and vascular endothelial growth
  factor alpha VEGFA in human osteosarcoma OS . METHODS: Copy number aberrations of
  WWOX, RUNX2and VEGFA genes were detected by microarray comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH in 10 fresh OS tissue samples. VEGFA gene alterations were also investigated
  and validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH in 54 formalin-fixed and
  paraffin-embedded FFPE OS samples. Protein expression of WWOX, RUNX2 and VEGFA were
  examined in 54 FFPE OS samples by immunohistochemistry IHC . RESULTS: Analysis of
  previously published OS aCGH data GSE9654 and aCGH data from this study GSE19180
  identified significant deletion of WWOX in 30 6 20 of OS samples, whilst significant
  increase in both RUNX2 and VEGFA gene copy numbers were detected in 55 11 20 and
  60 12 20 of OS samples, respectively. FISH demonstrated increased VEGFA gene copy
  number in 65.9 31 47 of evaluable samples, in either focal or large fragment forms.
  Compared with positive expression of WWOX in 38.9 of the OS samples, positive expression
  of RUNX2 and VEGFA protein was found in 48.1 and 75.9 of samples. Although there
  was no significant association between gene copy number aberration and protein expression
  for WWOX and RUNX2, significant positive correlation between increased VEGFA gene
  copy number and VEGFA protein expression was observed. Although there was no significant
  reverse association between WWOX and RUNX2 expression, a significantly positive
  relationship was observed between RUNX2 and VEGFA protein expression. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our data show increased RUNX2 and VEGFA gene copy numbers and elevation of their
  respective proteins in human OS. Positive correlation of RUNX2 and VEGFA suggests
  that both increased VEGFA gene copy number and RUNX2 overexpression facilitate increased
  expression of VEGFA.'
