abstract: Mantle cell leukemia MCLeu has been considered as a leukemic form of mantle
  cell lymphoma MCL . However, the presence of certain features rarely observed in
  MCL, such as transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia PLL or indolent clinical
  course, suggests that MCLeu may represent a distinct disorder.
