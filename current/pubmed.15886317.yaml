abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL comprises molecularly distinct subgroups
  such as activated B-cell-like ABC and germinal center B-cell-like GCB DLBCLs. We
  previously reported that CD5 and CD5 - CD10 DLBCL constitute clinically relevant
  subgroups. To determine whether these 2 subgroups are related to ABC and GCB DLBCLs,
  we analyzed the genomic imbalance of 99 cases 36 CD5 , 19 CD5 - CD10 , and 44 CD5
  - CD10 - using array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Forty-six of
  these cases 22 CD5 , 7 CD5 - CD10 , and 17 CD5 - CD10 - were subsequently subjected
  to gene-expression profiling, resulting in their division into 28 ABC 19 CD5 and
  9 CD5 - CD10 - and 18 GCB 3 CD5 , 7 CD5 - CD10 , and 8 CD5 - CD10 - types. A comparison
  of genome profiles of distinct subgroups of DLBCL demonstrated that 1 ABC DLBCL
  is characterized by gain of 3q, 18q, and 19q and loss of 6q and 9p21, and GCB DLBCL
  is characterized by gain of 1q, 2p, 7q, and 12q 2 the genomic imbalances characteristic
  of the CD5 and CD5 - CD10 groups were similar to those of the ABC and GCB types,
  respectively. These findings suggest that CD5 and CD5 - CD10 subgroups are included,
  respectively, in the ABC and GCB types. Finally, when searching for genomic imbalances
  that affect patients prognosis, we found that 9p21 loss p16 INK4a locus marks the
  most aggressive type of DLBCL.
