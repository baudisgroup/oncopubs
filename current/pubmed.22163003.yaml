abstract: 'Ovarian carcinomas exhibit extensive heterogeneity, and their etiology
  remains unknown. Histological and genetic evidence has led to the proposal that
  low grade ovarian serous carcinomas LGOSC have a different etiology than high grade
  carcinomas HGOSC , arising from serous tumours of low malignant potential LMP .
  Common regions of chromosome chr 3 loss have been observed in all types of serous
  ovarian tumours, including benign, suggesting that these regions contain genes important
  in the development of all ovarian serous carcinomas. A high-density genome-wide
  genotyping bead array technology, which assayed amp gt 600,000 markers, was applied
  to a panel of serous benign and LMP tumours and a small set of LGOSC, to characterize
  somatic events associated with the most indolent forms of ovarian disease. The genomic
  patterns inferred were related to TP53, KRAS and BRAF mutations. An increasing frequency
  of genomic anomalies was observed with pathology of disease: 3 22 13.6 benign cases,
  40 53 75.5 LMP cases and 10 11 90.9 LGOSC cases. Low frequencies of chr3 anomalies
  occurred in all tumour types. Runs of homozygosity were most commonly observed on
  chr3, with the 3p12-p11 candidate tumour suppressor region the most frequently homozygous
  region in the genome. An LMP harboured a homozygous deletion on chr6 which created
  a GOPC-ROS1 fusion gene, previously reported as oncogenic in other cancer types.
  Somatic TP53, KRAS and BRAF mutations were not observed in benign tumours. KRAS-mutation
  positive LMP cases displayed significantly more chromosomal aberrations than BRAF-mutation
  positive or KRAS and BRAF mutation negative cases. Gain of 12p, which harbours the
  KRAS gene, was particularly evident. A pathology review reclassified all TP53-mutation
  positive LGOSC cases, some of which acquired a HGOSC status. Taken together, our
  results support the view that LGOSC could arise from serous benign and LMP tumours,
  but does not exclude the possibility that HGOSC may derive from LMP tumours.'
