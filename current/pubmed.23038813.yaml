abstract: The breast tumor microenvironment plays an active role in tumorigenesis.
  Molecular alterations have been identified in tumor-associated stroma however, there
  is considerable debate as to whether the stroma is characterized by genomic instability
  or whether detection of chromosomal alterations reflects technological artifact
  rather than the true genomic content of the tumor microenvironment. Thus, breast
  stroma specimens from 112 women undergoing reductive mammoplasty n 7 , prophylactic
  mastectomy n 6 , or mastectomy for a breast disease n 99 were frozen in optimal
  cutting temperature medium. Allelic imbalance AI analysis was conducted using a
  panel of 52 microsatellite markers in 484 stromal specimens from 98 women, of which
  92 had no detectable AI events. When compared with previously generated AI data
  from 77 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FFPE stroma specimens, 42 of which harbored
  at least one detectable AI event, the frequency of AI in the FFPE specimens 4.62
  was significantly higher P lt 0.001 than that found in frozen specimens 0.45 . This
  comparison of AI between FFPE and research-grade specimens suggests that past reports
  of AI in breast stroma reflect artifact in the archival specimens caused by formalin-fixation,
  paraffin-embedding and tissue storage. Furthermore, SNP data were generated from
  a subset of 86 stromal specimens using SNP arrays and copy number alterations were
  identified using Partek Genomics Suite. For 95 of the specimens, no detectable copy
  number alterations were found and the 11 changes that were detected were small and
  not shared between specimens. These data, therefore, support a model in which the
  tumor microenvironment is genetically stable.
