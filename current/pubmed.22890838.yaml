abstract: We studied marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract
  including seven small cell lymphomas, eight large cell areas of composite lymphomas
  and 13 large cell variants using SNP array profiling. We found an increase of genomic
  complexity with lymphoma progression from small to large cytology, and identified
  gains of prominent proto oncogenes such as REL, BCL11A, ETS1, PTPN1, PTEN and KRAS
  which were found exclusively in the large cell variants. Copy numbers of ADAM3A,
  SCAPER and SIRPB1 were varying between the three different modes of presentation,
  hence suggestive for aberrations associated with progression from small to large
  cell lymphoma. The number of aberrations was slightly higher in the large cell part
  of composite lymphomas than in large cell lymphomas, suggesting that clonal selection
  takes place and that composite lymphomas are in a transition state. To further investigate
  this, we comparatively analyzed samples of two morphologically different regions
  of the same small cell tumor with a BIRC3-MALT1 translocation, as well as material
  acquired at two different time points from one composite lymphoma. We found genomic
  heterogeneity in both cases, supporting the theory of competing subclones in the
  evolution and progression of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.
