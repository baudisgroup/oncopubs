abstract: 'Numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities are common in hematological
  malignancies. Near-triploidy 58-80 chromosomes is a numerical abnormality observed
  in 3 of adult cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Near-triploidy is rare in myeloid
  lineage hematologic malignancies and compared to near-triploidy in lymphoid malignancies,
  near-triploidy in myeloid malignancies is associated with poor outcomes. Few studies
  on near-triploidy in myelodysplastic syndrome MDS have been reported, and the clinicopathologic
  significance of this condition is still unclear. Here, we report a novel case of
  MDS with near-triploidy and multiple structural chromosomal abnormalities: del 5q
  combined with del 1p and del 13q . These abnormalities were detected by cytogenetic
  analysis with array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Our results suggest
  that array CGH can be a useful tool for detecting chromosomal abnormalities in patients
  with MDS.'
