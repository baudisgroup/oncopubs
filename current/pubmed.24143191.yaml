abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The accurate prognosis definition to tailor treatment for early
  luminal invasive breast carcinoma patients remains challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  Two hundred fourteen early luminal breast carcinomas were genotyped with single
  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) array to determine the number of chromosomal breakpoints
  as a marker of genomic instability. Proliferation was assessed by KI67 (immunohistochemistry)
  and genomic grade index (transcriptomic analysis). IHC3 (IHC4 score for HER2 negative
  tumors) was also determined. RESULTS: In the training set (109 cases), the optimal
  cut-off was 34 breakpoints with a specificity of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 0.57
  (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.81[0.71; 0.91]). In the validation set (105 cases),
  the outcome of patients with > 34 breakpoints (11 events / 22 patients) was poorer
  (logrank test p < 0.001; Relative Risk (RR): 3.7 [1.73; 7.92]), than that of patients
  with < 34 breakpoints (19 events / 83 patients).Whereas genomic grade and KI67 had
  a significant prognostic value in univariate analysis in contrast to IHC3 that failed
  to have a statistical significant prognostic value in this series, the number of
  breakpoints remained the only significant parameter predictive of outcome (RR: 3.47,
  Confidence Interval (CI [1.29; 9.31], p = 0.014)) in multivariate analysis . CONCLUSION:
  Genomic instability, defined herein as a high number of chromosomal breakpoints,
  in early stage luminal breast carcinoma is a stronger prognostic marker than proliferation.'
