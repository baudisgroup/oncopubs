abstract: 'Chromosomal imbalances resulting in altered gene dosage play a role in
  the molecular pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC , but the target
  genes remain to be identified. To identify early-stage genetic events that drive
  progression of NSCLC, we conducted a high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH study, using an array of 4,046 bacterial artificial chromosome clones to screen
  for DNA copy number changes associated with individual genes in 36 tumors obtained
  from patients in early stages of NSCLC. Multiple early genetic events occurring
  on chromosome 5p were identified, with a minimal detection region at 5p15.33 approximately
  12. The most frequent finding involved gain of 5p15.33, observed in 15 of 19 stage
  I A B cancers 79 and in 28 of the total 36 NSCLC cases 78 . This locus harbors the
  genes TERT, SLC6A19, and SLC6A18 and is a telomeric boundary at bacterial artificial
  chromosome BAC clone 91_J20. Other potential candidate genes evidencing high numbers
  of genomic copy number changes amp gt or 40 of patients included the following genes,
  encountered in amp gt 50 of 19 stage I A B cancers: CEP72 and TPPP 14 of 19 74 AHRR,
  EXOC3 previously SEC6L1 , SLC9A3, LOC442126, ZDHHC11, BRD9, and TRIP13 13 19 68
  and CLPTM1L alias CRR9 , SLC6A3 previously DAT1 , and LOC401169 10 19 53 . Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization validated the array CGH findings. The gain of 5p15.33 is thus
  one of the most consistent alterations in the early stages of lung cancer, and a
  series of genes in the critical 5p15.33 region may be used as novel biomarkers for
  the early detection and classification of lung cancer.'
