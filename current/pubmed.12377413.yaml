abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH and conventional cytogenetic karyotyping
  were used to screen for losses and gains of DNA sequences along chromosomes in ten
  renal tumors RCC of different histologic types clear-cell RCC, papillary RCC, and
  one oncocytoma . Loss of 3p was the most common change in clear-cell RCC. All papillary
  tumors, either adenomas or carcinomas revealed gains of chromosomes 7 and 17q without
  limitation to size and grade. Homozygotic loss of the pseudoautosomal Xp or Yp region
  was detected in three RCC tumors. A dicentric Y 14 was present as the sole chromosome
  abnormality in the oncocytoma. Both techniques showed concordant results in tumors
  with homogeneous karyotype. However, in tumors with several composite clones some
  discrepancies were observed, especially in cases of clear-cell RCC where chromosomal
  abnormalities present in a low number of metaphases could not be detected by CGH.
