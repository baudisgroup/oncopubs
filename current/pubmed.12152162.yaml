abstract: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma IMC of the breast is a rare variant of
  invasive ductal carcinoma IDC characterized by unique histology and an extremely
  high incidence of lymph node metastases approximately 95 . Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH was used to characterize DNA extracted from 16 archival IMC cases to identify
  clonal genetic changes associated with this unique and highly metastatic cancer
  subtype. The average number of chromosomal alterations per IMC tumor was 7.4 -2.9
  3.4 gains and 3.9 losses , fewer than the number that we have observed in IDCs not
  otherwise specified 9.5 -6.6 , IDCs with erbB-2 gene amplification 12.6 -5.9 , and
  invasive lobular carcinomas 8.2 -5.5 . The mean number of changes in IMC was significantly
  higher than we have observed in the rarely metastasizing tubular subtype of IDC
  3.9 -2.3, P 0.001 , but less than the more aggressive subset of erbB-2-amplified
  IDC P 0.02 . Remarkably, 100 of IMCs demonstrated loss involving the short arm of
  chromosome 8 8p . Six cases showed loss of the entire 8p arm, whereas in 10 cases
  the loss was limited to the distal portion 8p21-pter with localized gain of proximal
  8p 8p11-p12 . A reciprocal gain of 8q was detected in 14 cases 88 . Other common
  alterations included loss of 17p in 50 of tumors and loss of 16q in 50 of IMC cases.
  Gains of 17q 38 , 1q 31 , and 16p 25 were also commonly detected. In comparison,
  IDCs not otherwise specified , IDCs of the tubular subtype, and invasive lobular
  carcinomas showed only modest 8p loss 33 , 28 , and 13 , respectively . This region
  of chromosome 8 may contain 1 or more genes whose loss leads to this particular
  histology and or the lymphotrophic phenotype associated with this histopathologic
  pattern.
