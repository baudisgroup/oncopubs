abstract: Tumors arising from the liver, biliary tract and pancreas, which originate
  in the foregut and are in close anatomical proximity to each other, sometimes show
  similar histological features. No studies have focused on genetic similarities and
  differences between tumors of these organs. To elucidate the similarities and differences
  in DNA copy number alterations between tumors of these organs, we applied comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to cancers of the liver 31 cases , biliary tract 42 cases
  and pancreas 27 cases . Some alterations were common to tumors of all three organs,
  and some were preferential in certain types of tumor. Gains of 1q and 8q and losses
  of 8p and 17p were common to all tumors. In contrast, 13q14 and 16q losses were
  detected exclusively in hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs p amp lt 0.01 . The incidence
  of 17q21 gain and 5q loss was higher in biliary tract cancers than in the other
  two types p amp lt 0.05 . Pancreatic cancers exhibited higher incidence of 5q14-q23
  gain and 19p loss than tumors of other organs p amp lt 0.01 . Gains of 7p, 7q, 12p
  and 20q and losses of 3p, 6q, 9p and 18q were frequent in both biliary tract and
  pancreatic cancers but rare in HCCs p amp lt 0.05 . The present results suggest
  that although genes located at 1q, 8p, 8q and 17p are frequently involved in HCC,
  biliary tract and pancreatic cancer, at least some of the genes implicated in carcinogenesis
  are different between these three types. It is also suggested that CGH analysis
  is useful as a potential adjunct for the diagnosis and management of these tumors
  of organs that are anatomically close to one another.
