abstract: It has been proposed that an aggressive secondary cancer stem cell population
  arises from a primary cancer stem cell population through acquisition of additional
  genetic mutations and drives cancer progression. Overexpression of Polycomb protein
  EZH2, essential in stem cell self-renewal, has been linked to breast cancer progression.
  However, critical mechanism linking increased EZH2 expression to BTIC breast tumor
  initiating cell regulation and cancer progression remains unclear. Here, we identify
  a mechanism in which EZH2 expression-mediated downregulation of DNA damage repair
  leads to accumulation of recurrent RAF1 gene amplification in BTICs, which activates
  p-ERK-beta-catenin signaling to promote BTIC expansion. We further reveal that AZD6244,
  a clinical trial drug that inhibits RAF1-ERK signaling, could prevent breast cancer
  progression by eliminating BTICs.
