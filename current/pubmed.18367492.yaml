abstract: Low-grade B-cell lymphomas are a very heterogeneous group of tumors, whose
  differential diagnosis is frequently compromised by the lack of specific cytogenetic
  or molecular features. Our objective was to search for genomic features that allow
  a better molecular identification of the different types of lymphoma studied.
