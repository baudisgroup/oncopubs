abstract: Papillary glioneuronal tumors PGNTs are rare lesions of the central nervous
  system, and no information exists on the genetic alterations in these neoplasms.
  The authors report on such a case in a child. Genetic studies revealed that the
  tumor was characterized by gains and structural alterations involving only chromosome
  7 with breakpoints at 7p22. By using comparative genomic hybridization, the authors
  observed a high-level amplification region at 7p14 q12. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
  with a probe for EGFR revealed that this gene was not amplified. Similar to other
  patients with PGNTs, the patient in the present case fared well. From a genetic
  point of view the data in the present case are in accordance with previous findings
  of EGFR amplifications as uncommon in low-grade gliomas and gangliogliomas. Recurrent
  rearrangements of chromosome 7 have been noted in other mixed glioneuronal tumors.
  The data in this case suggest that genes located at chromosome 7 can also be involved
  in the pathogenesis of PGNT. In clinical terms it will be especially important to
  corroborate, through the analysis of further cases, the involvement of the chromosome
  7p22 locus, a region where glial and neuronal linked genes RAC1 and NXPH1 are known
  to be located.
