abstract: Tumor risk stratification during diagnosis is paramount for children with
  medulloblastomas, primarily because very young patients amp lt 3 years suffer cognitive
  deficits from radio- and chemotherapy sequelae. Thus, distinguishing tumors that
  are biologically more aggressive is essential for medulloblastoma management to
  maximize the delay in radiation treatment without adversely affecting survival outcome.
  In this context, current strategies for risk assessment, which are based on clinical
  parameters, remain unsatisfactory.
