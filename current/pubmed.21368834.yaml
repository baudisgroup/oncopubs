abstract: Microtubules have pivotal roles in fundamental cellular processes and are
  targets of antitubulin chemotherapeutics. Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol
  and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian
  and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas.
  These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through
  poorly defined mechanisms. The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade
  death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear. Here we show that the pro-survival
  protein MCL1 ref. 3 is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin
  chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly,
  through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation
  of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is
  the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation
  of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was
  blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function
  mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced
  polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation
  and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in
  oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours,
  in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful
  to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.
