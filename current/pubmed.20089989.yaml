abstract: Abnormalities in nuclear phenotype and chromosome structure are key features
  of cancer cells. Investigation of the protein determinants of nuclear subfractions
  in cancer may yield molecular insights into aberrant chromosome function and chromatin
  organization and in addition may yield biomarkers for early cancer detection. Here
  we evaluate a proteomics work flow for profiling protein constituents in subnuclear
  domains in colorectal cancer tissues and apply this work flow to a comparative analysis
  of the nuclear matrix fraction in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma tissue samples.
  First, we established the reproducibility of the entire work flow. In a reproducibility
  analysis of three nuclear matrix fractions independently isolated from the same
  colon tumor homogenate, 889 of 1,047 proteins 85 were reproducibly identified at
  high confidence minimally two peptides per protein at 99 confidence interval at
  the protein level with an average coefficient of variance for the number of normalized
  spectral counts per protein of 30 . This indicates a good reproducibility of the
  entire work flow from biochemical isolation to nano-LC-MS MS analysis. Second, using
  spectral counting combined with statistics, we identified proteins that are significantly
  enriched in the nuclear matrix fraction relative to two earlier fractions the chromatin-binding
  and intermediate filament fractions isolated from six colorectal tissue samples.
  The total data set contained 2,059 non-redundant proteins. Gene ontology mining
  and protein network analysis of nuclear matrix-enriched proteins revealed enrichment
  for proteins implicated in amp quot RNA processing amp quot and amp quot mRNA metabolic
  process. amp quot Finally, an explorative comparison of the nuclear matrix proteome
  in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma tissues revealed many proteins previously implicated
  in oncogenesis as well as new candidates. A subset of these differentially expressed
  proteins also exhibited a corresponding change at the mRNA level. Together, the
  results show that subnuclear proteomics of tumor tissue is feasible and a promising
  avenue for exploring oncogenesis.
