abstract: Chromosomal aberrations in 22 Koreans with ovarian carcinomas were investigated
  by degenerate oligonucleotide primed-polymerase chain reaction comparative genomic
  hybridization. The common sites of copy number increases were 20q 90 , 17q23 approximately
  qter 86 , 8q22 approximately qter 68 , 3q25 approximately qter 59 , 6p21 59 , 11q13
  54 , 16p 40 , 2q31 approximately qter 36 , 7q 36 , 14q31 36 , 15q24 approximately
  qter 36 , and 1q32 approximately qter 31 . DNA amplification was identified in 18
  carcinomas 82 . The frequent sites of amplification were 20q13.2 approximately qter,
  8q24.1, 17q23 approximately qter, 3q25 approximately qter, and 6p21. The most frequent
  sites of copy number decreases were 4q21 approximately q31 54 , 5q13 approximately
  q21 50 , and 13q14 approximately q21 45 . The recurrent gains and losses of chromosomal
  regions identified in this study provide candidate regions that may contain oncogenes
  or tumor suppressor genes, respectively.
