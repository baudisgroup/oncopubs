abstract: To investigate the etiology of MLH1 promoter methylation in mismatch repair
  MMR mutation-negative early onset MSI-H colon cancer. As this type of colon cancer
  is associated with high ages, young patients bearing this type of malignancy are
  rare and could provide additional insight into the etiology of sporadic MSI-H colon
  cancer.
