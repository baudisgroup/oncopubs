abstract: DNA copy number changes were studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in 50 chondrosarcoma samples from 45 patients. Mean number of genetic aberrations
  in primary tumors was 4.8 - 1.8. The most frequently gained regions were 20q12-qter
  37 , 20q 32 , 8q24.1-qter 27 , 20p 24 , and 14q24-qter 24 . Losses were 5.5 times
  less frequent than gains and observed mainly at Xcen-q21, 6cen-q22, and 18cen-q11.2
  11 each . Recurrent and metastatic tumors showed a mean of 4.0 - 2.2 aberrations
  per sample. The most frequently gained regions were chromosome 7 4 cases , 5q14-q32
  4 cases , 6p 3 cases , and 12q 3 cases . Losses of DNA sequences were 3.4 times
  less frequent than gains. Histological tumor grade was significantly associated
  with metastasis-free survival P .002 and overall survival P .003 , being the strongest
  prognostic factor tested. A statistically significant correlation was found between
  gain at 8q24.1-qter and shorter overall survival P .01 but not with local recurrence
  or metastasis-free survival. Gain at 14q24-qter was associated with a trend to shorter
  overall survival P .05 but neither with an increased risk for local recurrence nor
  with metastasis-free survival. In a multivariate analysis, only the tumor grade
  associated with overall survival P .02 . In a multivariate analysis together with
  the tumor grade, gain at 8q24.1-qter did not retain its significance P .44 , indicating
  that this imbalance is not an independent prognostic factor.
