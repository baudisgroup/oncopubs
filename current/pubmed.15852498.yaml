abstract: 'It was recently shown by flow and static cytometry that a large sub-group
  of follicular adenomas of the thyroid--fetal embryonal adenomas--display an aneuploid
  phenotype. It was also shown that thyroid lesions with a DNA content within the
  triploid range were either fetal adenomas or follicular carcinomas with a fetal
  adenoma growth pattern. Follicular tumours with growth patterns other than the so-called
  fetal adenoma-like pattern were usually diploid or near-diploid. In an attempt to
  clarify the pattern of chromosomal imbalances in follicular tumours, comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH analysis was performed in a series of 18 follicular neoplasms
  ten fetal embryonal and four common follicular adenomas and four minimally invasive
  follicular carcinomas . For each tumour, the DNA content was determined by flow
  cytometry and, in some cases, also by static cytometry. Finally, the copy number
  of selected chromosomes was determined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH using centromere probes. With the exception of the single diploid fetal adenoma,
  all fetal adenomas displayed several DNA copy number changes, with frequent gains
  of several chromosomes, which were found to be either tetrasomic or trisomic by
  FISH. This genetic pattern was also present in the single case of follicular carcinoma
  with aneuploidy and fetal adenoma-like growth pattern. Follicular adenomas other
  than fetal adenomas, and the remaining follicular carcinomas, showed more losses
  than gains of chromosomes. These results suggest that follicular tumourigenesis
  may follow at least two pathways: one characterized by prominent aneuploidy and
  numerous gains, in which the tumours display a fetal adenoma-like growth pattern
  and another accompanied by less obvious aneuploidy or even quasi-diploidy and dominant
  chromosome losses, in which the tumours display a common follicular architecture.'
