abstract: Phyllodes tumors are rare neoplasms of the breast. Although they contain
  both epithelial and stromal components they are considered to be stromally derived
  lesions. The chromosomal copy number changes were determined in 19 well characterized
  samples from 18 patients using comparative genomic hybridization. Most chromosomes
  were involved and generally the gains and losses were similar to those found in
  breast cancer with the exception that the phyllodes tumors showed no evidence of
  genomic amplification. The one recurrent sample analyzed had the same imbalances
  as the original tumor. Frequent changes were gain of 1q 7 18 and loss of 3p 6 18
  , followed by gain of 7q 4 18 and loss of 6q 4 18 and 3q 3 18 . Gain of 1q material
  was significantly associated with histologically defined stromal overgrowth P 0.011
  . In addition, all the cases with gain of 1q material, without 1p gain, had a clinical
  history of recurrence. Only one case without 1q gain had a recurrence and this had
  loss of the X chromosome as the sole abnormality. Increased copy number of 1q material
  in the phyllodes tumors studied, in one case restricted to 1q24-32, was associated
  with recurrence P 0.00365 and might therefore be considered as an indicator of local
  aggressiveness requiring more radical treatment.
