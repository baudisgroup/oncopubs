abstract: Background Among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), data
  on intratumor heterogeneity and cancer genome evolution have been limited to small
  retrospective cohorts. We wanted to prospectively investigate intratumor heterogeneity
  in relation to clinical outcome and to determine the clonal nature of driver events
  and evolutionary processes in early-stage NSCLC. Methods In this prospective cohort
  study, we performed multiregion whole-exome sequencing on 100 early-stage NSCLC
  tumors that had been resected before systemic therapy. We sequenced and analyzed
  327 tumor regions to define evolutionary histories, obtain a census of clonal and
  subclonal events, and assess the relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and
  recurrence-free survival. Results We observed widespread intratumor heterogeneity
  for both somatic copy-number alterations and mutations. Driver mutations in EGFR,
  MET, BRAF, and TP53 were almost always clonal. However, heterogeneous driver alterations
  that occurred later in evolution were found in more than 75% of the tumors and were
  common in PIK3CA and NF1 and in genes that are involved in chromatin modification
  and DNA damage response and repair. Genome doubling and ongoing dynamic chromosomal
  instability were associated with intratumor heterogeneity and resulted in parallel
  evolution of driver somatic copy-number alterations, including amplifications in
  CDK4, FOXA1, and BCL11A. Elevated copy-number heterogeneity was associated with
  an increased risk of recurrence or death (hazard ratio, 4.9; P=4.4ï¿½10(-4)), which
  remained significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Intratumor heterogeneity
  mediated through chromosome instability was associated with an increased risk of
  recurrence or death, a finding that supports the potential value of chromosome instability
  as a prognostic predictor. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and others; TRACERx ClinicalTrials.gov
