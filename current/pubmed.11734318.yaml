abstract: We analyzed genomic aberrations in 20 cervical adenocarcinomas by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . Most tissue samples 85 showed DNA copy number changes
  gains were more common than losses. The most consistent region of chromosomal gain
  was mapped to chromosome arm 3q, found in 70 of the cases, with a minimal common
  region of 3q28-ter. Other recurrent amplifications of genetic material were detected
  on 17q 45 , 1p 30 , 1q 25 , and 11q 20 . High-level copy number increases were found
  in chromosomal regions 3q27-ter and 9pter-13. DNA losses were seldom observed, occurring
  primarily in underrepresented regions of chromosome arms 4q, 13q, and 18q. The presence
  of high-risk human papilloma virus genomes in the cervical adenocarcinoma samples
  was detected in 90 of the cases. However, there was no correlation between human
  papilloma virus type and the pattern of genomic changes. This study is the first
  report of CGH analysis in human cervical adenocarcinoma. Among the major genomic
  alterations, our results demonstrate the importance of DNA copy increases of chromosome
  arm 3q in the development of cervical adenocarcinoma and identify other amplified
  chromosomal regions that are also associated with cervical carcinogenesis.
