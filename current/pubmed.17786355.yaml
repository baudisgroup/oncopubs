abstract: 'Aneuploidy in papillary thyroid carcinomas PTCs is considered a marker
  of worse prognosis. Multiple genetic surveys have been performed in PTCs, however,
  we are not aware of any such studies in aneuploid PTCs. In order to contribute to
  a better comprehension of the genetic basis of this neoplasms more aggressive behaviour
  in 17 aneuploid PTCs we performed a comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis,
  studied the BRAF and RAS mutational status, searched for RET PTC1 and RET PTC3 rearrangements
  and determined their expression profile. Array results were validated by TaqMan
  and immunohistochemistry. CGH revealed multiple non-random chromosomal abnormalities.
  BRAFV600E and RAS mutations were found in 41.2 and 33 of the carcinomas respectively.
  None of the studied cases presented RET PTC1 or RET PTC3 rearrangement. When comparing
  array data with the chromosomal, mutational and clinical data we found that: a loss
  of control of cellular transcription was of major relevance in this group of neoplasms,
  HMGA2 being one of the most overexpressed genes b gene expression correlated with
  the mutational status of PTCs, as in BRAF cases cMET and FN1 were concomitantly
  overexpressed and c death from disease and distant metastasis was associated to
  the overexpression of DDR2 and to the down-regulation of genes involved in immune,
  inflammatory response, signal transduction and cell adhesion processes. In conclusion
  we have identified in aneuploid PTCs a group of significantly altered molecules
  that may represent preferential targets for the development of new more efficient
  therapies in this type of cancer.'
