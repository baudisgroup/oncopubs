abstract: An additional tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 9p telomeric to the CDKN2A
  B locus has long been postulated to exist. Using Affymetrix 250K single nucleotide
  polymorphism arrays to screen for copy number changes in glioblastoma multiforme
  GBM , we detected a high frequency of deletions of the PTPRD gene, which encodes
  a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase at chromosome 9p23-24.1. Missense and nonsense
  mutations of PTPRD were identified in a subset of the samples lacking deletions,
  including an inherited mutation with somatic loss of the wild-type allele. We then
  sequenced the gene in melanoma and identified 10 somatic mutations in 7 of 57 tumors
  12 . Reconstitution of PTPRD expression in GBM and melanoma cells harboring deletions
  or mutations led to growth suppression and apoptosis that was alleviated by both
  the somatic and constitutional mutations. These data implicate PTPRD in the pathogenesis
  of tumors of neuroectodermal origin and, when taken together with other recent reports
  of PTPRD mutations in adenocarcinoma of the colon and lung, suggest that PTPRD may
  be one of a select group of tumor suppressor genes that are inactivated in a wide
  range of common human tumor types.
