abstract: 'In approximately 70 of the families with a high frequency of early-onset
  breast and or ovarian cancer, BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations cannot be identified
  with the current screening regime. Therefore, we used data mining to identify a
  somatic genetic signature to differentiate BRCA1 mutation carriers from non-BRCA1
  carriers based on the genetic characteristics of their breast carcinomas. For this
  purpose, we developed a molecular classifier, which assigns a given tumor to either
  the BRCA1 or control group based on somatic genetic profiles as revealed by comparative
  genomic hybridization. This was performed on breast tumors selected from two groups
  of patients: 28 proven BRCA1 germline mutation carriers and a control group consisting
  of 42 breast tumors from patients with unknown BRCA1 or BRCA2 status. We show that
  BRCA1 breast carcinomas exhibit specific somatic genetic aberrations and can be
  distinguished from control tumors with an accuracy of 84 sensitivity of 96 and specificity
  of 76 . Chromosomal bands used by this classifier include regions on chromosomes
  3p, 3q, and 5q. The classifier miss-assigned one patient with a BRCA1 mutation to
  the non-BRCA1 class. The germline mutation in this patient is a 62bp deletion in
  the last exon of BRCA1 5622del62 . Possibly, this mutation may give a different
  phenotypic effect than do mutations in other regions of the gene. Validation on
  an independent set of BRCA1 and sporadic tumors showed that the BRCA1 classifier
  correctly identified all 6 BRCA1 tumors and assigned 4 of the 19 control patients
  to the BRCA1 class. The resulting accuracy on the validation set is 84 .'
