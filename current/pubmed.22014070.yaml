abstract: Metastatic progression due to development or enrichment of therapy-resistant
  tumor cells is eventually lethal. Molecular characterization of such chemotherapy
  resistant tumor cell clones may identify markers responsible for malignant progression
  and potential targets for new treatment. Here, in a case of stage IV adenocarcinoma
  of the gastroesophageal junction, we report the successful genome wide analysis
  using array comparative genomic hybridization CGH of DNA from only fourteen tumor
  cells using a bead-based single cell selection method from a bone metastasis progressing
  during chemotherapy.
