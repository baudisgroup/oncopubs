abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was used to develop a
  genome-wide molecular profile of oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC . Copy number
  alterations CNAs were identified by chromosomal region, mapped to specific genes,
  and compared with several previously documented CNAs associated with head and neck
  squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC . The status of 512 commonly altered cancer genes
  was assessed and evaluated as potential correlates of tumor behavior.
