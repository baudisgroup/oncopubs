abstract: Cancer cell lines represent an invaluable resource for isolation of novel
  genes relevant to tumor pathogenesis and as in vitro models. In this study, we report
  on the successful establishment of four cell lines from hepatocellular carcinoma
  tissue. These cell lines, designated HKCI-1, HKCI-2, HKCI-3, and HKCI-4, have been
  growing continuously for more than 24 months and have been passaged more than 50
  times. A comprehensive cytogenetic characterization on the primary tumors and the
  derived cell lines was achieved by the combined approach of spectral karyotyping
  and comparative genomic hybridization. Chromosomal imbalances from the primary tumors
  were also maintained in the cell lines and included gains of 1q, 6p, 7, 10p, 17q,
  and 20 and loss of 4q. Recurring translocations included t X 11 , t 1 10 , t 4 16
  , i 5 p10 , t 7 21 , t 8 17 , t 9 22 , i 10 p10 , t 14 20 , t 16 22 , and t 17 19
  . It was noteworthy that consistent chromosome 10 aberrations, in particular t 1
  10 q10 p10 , were detected in all four cell lines. Furthermore, microsatellite analysis
  on primary tumor and derived cell lines indicated a common deleted region of 10q23-q26.
  The functional importance of chromosome 10 aberrations in relation to the pathogenesis
  of HCC is unknown however, the high frequency with which such aberrations were maintained
  in the cell lines suggests proliferative advantages of 10q loss or 10p gain in the
  multistep development of hepatic neoplasia.
