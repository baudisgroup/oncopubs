abstract: It is widely recognized that genomic abnormalities underpin the development
  of human cancers. Aberrant patterns of chromosomal changes may represent useful
  information that can be used in classifying the complex traits of liver cancer cases
  for the genetic events involved in tumor carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and
  prognosis.
