abstract: 'Breast cancer is characterised by a number of genetic aberrations. Our
  purpose was to use comparative genomic hybridisation CGH to screen breast carcinomas
  for copy number changes: 44 ductal and 8 lobular carcinomas were studied and a large
  number of genetic aberrations identified. Many of these showed similarity to previous
  CGH results, however, a number of loci not previously shown to have undergone frequent
  change were identified. This included copy number gains affecting chromosomes 1p,
  4q, 5q, 6q and 13q. Furthermore, we have identified 2 regions of copy number change,
  the gain on 5p and deletion of 16q, which correlated with lobular carcinomas. Our
  results highlight several areas of the genome that may be important in the molecular
  genetics of breast cancer.'
