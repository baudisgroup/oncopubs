abstract: Recurrent genomic amplifications and deletions are frequently observed in
  primary gastric cancers (GC). However, identifying specific oncogenes and tumor
  suppressor genes within these regions can be challenging, as they often cover tens
  to hundreds of genes. Here, we combined high-resolution array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) with gene expression profiling to target genes within
  focal high-level amplifications in GC cell lines, and identified RAB23 as an amplified
  and overexpressed Chr 6p11p12 gene in Hs746T cells. High RAB23 protein expression
  was also observed in some lines lacking RAB23 amplification, suggesting additional
  mechanisms for up-regulating RAB23 besides gene amplification. siRNA silencing of
  RAB23 significantly reduced cellular invasion and migration in Hs746T cells, whereas
  overexpression of RAB23 enhanced cellular invasion in AGS cells. RAB23 amplifications
  in primary gastric tumors were confirmed by both fluorescence in situ hybridization
  and genomic qPCR, and in two independent patient cohorts from Hong Kong and the
  United Kingdom RAB23 expression was significantly associated with diffuse-type GC
  (dGC) compared with intestinal-type GC (iGC). These results provide further evidence
  that dGC and iGC likely represent two molecularly distinct tumor types, and show
  that investigating focal chromosomal amplifications by combining high-resolution
  aCGH with expression profiling is a powerful strategy for identifying novel cancer
  genes in regions of recurrent chromosomal aberration.
