abstract: Improved outcome of acute myeloid leukemia AML depends on the better differentiation
  of subtypes to predict treatment response and the identification of new target for
  treatment. In this study, array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was used
  to distinguish eight cases of AML cases. Validation was performed by FISH and quantitative
  genomic PCR. The aCGH revealed new large and small recurrent genomic imbalances,
  such as gains of 1p36, 10q26, 11p15, 20q13, 22q23, harboring many proto-oncogenes.
  These results better define genetically the studied cases and could be used to understand
  the multiple phenomena involved in leukemogenesis.
