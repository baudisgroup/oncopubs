abstract: To identify DNA copy number changes that had a direct influence on mRNA
  expression in gastric cancer, cDNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed using 17 K cDNA microarrays. A
  set of 158 genes showing Pearson correlation coefficients over 0.6 between DNA copy
  number changes and mRNA expression level variations was selected. In an independent
  gene expression profiling of 60 tissue samples, the 158 genes were able to distinguish
  most of the normal and tumor tissues in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering,
  suggesting that the differential expression patterns displayed by this specific
  group of genes are most likely based on the gene copy number changes. Furthermore,
  43 statistically significant P amp lt 0.01 genes were selected that correctly distinguished
  all of the tissue samples. The copy number changes detected by aCGH can be verified
  by fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The
  selected genes include those that were previously identified as being tumor suppressors
  or deleted in various tumors, including GATA binding protein 4 GATA4 , monoamine
  oxidase A MAOA , cyclin C CCNC , and oncogenes including malignant fibrous histiocytoma
  amplified sequence 1 MFHAS1 MASL1 , high mobility group AT-hook 2 HMGA2 , PPAR binding
  protein PPARBP , growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 GRB7 , and TBC1 tre-2, BUB2,
  cdc16 domain family, member 1 TBC1D1 .
