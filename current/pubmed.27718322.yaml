abstract: A cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) in a child recurred first with a
  PA histology and then with features of a ganglioglioma (GG). Molecular genetic analyses
  of the tumors confirmed a BRAF V600E mutation in all. They also all harbored a T202M
  mutation in ERK1, a kinase downstream of BRAF that is implicated in glial versus
  neuronal differentiation. The GG sample contained several variants that were not
  present in the PA samples; in particular, it had a truncating mutation in MAP2.
  These findings not only underscore the role of BRAF as oncogenic driver but also
  suggest that other genes may influence tumor morphology.
