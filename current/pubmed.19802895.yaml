abstract: Array CGH was used to identify recurrent copy number alterations RCNA characteristic
  of either BRCA1-related or sporadic ovarian cancer. After preprocessing, both groups
  of patients were modeled using a recurrent Hidden Markov Model to detect RCNA. RCNA
  with a probability higher than 80 were called. After removing RCNA present in both
  groups, the genes present in the remaining RCNA were investigated for enrichment
  of pathways from external databases. More RCNA were observed in the BRCA1 group,
  and they display more losses than gains compared to the sporadic group. When focusing
  on the type of RCNA, no significant difference in length was seen for the gains,
  but there was a statistically significant difference for the losses. In the sporadic
  group, a great proportion of the altered regions contain genes known to have a function
  in cell adhesion and complement activation, whereas the BRCA1 samples are characterized
  by alterations in the HOX genes, metalloproteinases, tumor suppressor genes, and
  the estrogen-signaling pathways. We conclude that BRCA1 ovarian tumors present a
  different type, number, and length of RCNA a huge amount of the genome is lost,
  resulting in important genomic instability. Moreover, important biological pathways
  are altered differentially when compared to the sporadic group.
