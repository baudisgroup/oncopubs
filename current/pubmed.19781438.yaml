abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia AML cases with monosomy 7 -7 and del 7q comprise
  a heterogeneous subgroup. The association of losses in 7q with myeloid leukemia
  suggests that this region contains a tumor suppressor gene or genes whose loss of
  function contributes to leukemic transformation or tumor progression. The -7 del
  7q aberrations frequently coexist with complex karyotypes such as -5 del 5q and
  trisomy 8. In the present case, we identified a rare abnormality involving deletion
  of both arms of chromosome 7 presenting with a marker chromosome-like appearance
  in an AML patient. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed acute myelomonocytic
  leukemia. Immunophenotyping study showed CD13, CD14, CD33, CD117, and myeloperoxidase
  positivities. Analysis of 20 metaphases indicated a diploid cell number with an
  unidentifiable tiny marker chromosome instead of one normal chromosome 7, described
  as 46,XY,-7, mar 20 . Array comparative genomic hybridization test confirmed the
  chromosome 7 origin of the marker chromosome with deletions of 7p and 7q. The evaluation
  after remission induction treatment indicated morphological and cytogenetic remissions.
  There is evidence that the outcome is better when -7 or del 7q occurs in patients
  with a simple karyotype, compared with a complex karyotype.
