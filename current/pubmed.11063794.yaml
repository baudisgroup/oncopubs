abstract: 'We examined homogenized tissue samples of biopsies from 19 astrocytomas
  of different grades for genetic imbalances using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH : three astrocytomas grade II, and 16 astrocytomas grade IV glioblastoma multiforme
  , one of the glioblastomas representing the recurrence of a benign oligoastrocytoma.
  In two of three cases of astrocytoma grade II, a gain of chromosome 7 was found.
  The alterations in the glioblastomas were complex, and most frequently showed the
  characteristic gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10. The single analyzed
  case of recurrence of an oligoastrocytoma was characterized by a unique CGH pattern.
  This tumor showed two distinct alterations: apart from an amplification on 15q24q26,
  we found a distinct amplification of a small region on 20p11.2p12, which has not
  been previously described in brain tumors. Partial or complete gains of chromosome
  20 arose in six other tumors we conclude that chromosome 20 in particular 20p11.
  2p12, may harbor relevant genes for glioma progression.'
