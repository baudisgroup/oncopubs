abstract: To identify the genetic drivers of colorectal tumorigenesis, we applied
  array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to 13 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  FFPE samples of early, localized human colon adenocarcinomas arising in high-grade
  adenomas so-called amp quot malignant polyps amp quot . These lesions are small
  and hence the amount of DNA is limited. Additionally, the quality of DNA is compromised
  due to the fragmentation as a consequence of formalin fixation. To overcome these
  problems, we optimized a newly developed isothermal whole genome amplification system
  NuGEN Ovation WGA FFPE System . Starting with 100 ng of FFPE DNA, the amplification
  system produced 4.01 0.29 g mean standard deviation of DNA. The excellent quality
  of amplified DNA was further indicated by a high signal-to-noise ratio and a low
  derivative log 2 ratio spread. Both, the amount of amplified DNA and aCGH performance
  were independent of the age of the FFPE blocks and the associated degradation of
  the extracted DNA. We observed losses of chromosome arms 5q and 18q in the adenoma
  components of the malignant polyp samples, while the embedded early carcinomas revealed
  losses of 8p, 17p, and 18, and gains of 7, 13, and 20. Aberrations detected in the
  adenoma components were invariably maintained in the embedded carcinomas. This approach
  demonstrates that using isothermally whole genome amplified FFPE DNA is technically
  suitable for aCGH. In addition to demonstrating the clonal origin of the adenoma
  and carcinoma part within a malignant polyp, the gain of chromosome arm 20q was
  an indicator for progression from adenoma to carcinoma.
