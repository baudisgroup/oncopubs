abstract: High-grade osteosarcoma is a tumor with a complex genomic profile, occurring
  primarily in adolescents with a second peak at middle age. The extensive genomic
  alterations obscure the identification of genes driving tumorigenesis during osteosarcoma
  development. To identify such driver genes, we integrated DNA copy number profiles
  Affymetrix SNP 6.0 of 32 diagnostic biopsies with 84 expression profiles Illumina
  Human-6 v2.0 of high-grade osteosarcoma as compared with its putative progenitor
  cells, i.e., mesenchymal stem cells n 12 or osteoblasts n 3 . In addition, we performed
  paired analyses between copy number and expression profiles of a subset of 29 patients
  for which both DNA and mRNA profiles were available. Integrative analyses were performed
  in Nexus Copy Number software and statistical language R. Paired analyses were performed
  on all probes detecting significantly differentially expressed genes in corresponding
  LIMMA analyses. For both nonpaired and paired analyses, copy number aberration frequency
  was set to 35 . Nonpaired and paired integrative analyses resulted in 45 and 101
  genes, respectively, which were present in both analyses using different control
  sets. Paired analyses detected 90 of all genes found with the corresponding nonpaired
  analyses. Remarkably, approximately twice as many genes as found in the corresponding
  nonpaired analyses were detected. Affected genes were intersected with differentially
  expressed genes in osteosarcoma cell lines, resulting in 31 new osteosarcoma driver
  genes. Cell division related genes, such as MCM4 and LATS2, were overrepresented
  and genomic instability was predictive for metastasis-free survival, suggesting
  that deregulation of the cell cycle is a driver of osteosarcomagenesis.
