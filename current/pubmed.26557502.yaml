abstract: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are rare pediatric brain tumors
  characterized by bialleic loss of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene. In contrast
  to pediatric AT/RT that has a simple genome, very little is known about the adult
  AT/RT genomic landscape. Using a combination of whole-exome sequencing and high-resolution
  SNP array in a single adult pituitary AT/RT, we identified a total of 47 non-synonymous
  mutations, of which 20 were predicted to cause non-conservative amino acid substitutions,
  in addition to a subclone of cells with trisomy 8. We suggest that adult AT/RT may
  not be markedly dissimilar to other adult brain tumors where mutations in a range
  of genes, reflecting the functional specialization of different brain regions, but
  including SMARCB1 inactivation, may be required for its pathogenesis.
