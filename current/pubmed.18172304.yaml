abstract: It is generally accepted that human cancers derive from a mutated single
  cell. However, the genetic steps characterizing various stages of progression remain
  unclear. Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma, we observed that cell lines
  derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core
  of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study, we
  expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal
  derivation with allogeneic ones and correlated array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to
  the dynamics of disease progression. aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed
  on autologous cell lines and allogeneic melanoma cell lines originating from other
  patients. A striking correlation existed between total extent of genetic imbalances,
  global transcriptional patterns, and cellular phenotypes. They did not follow a
  strict temporal progression but stemmed independently at various time points from
  a central core of genetic stability best explained according to the cancer stem
  cell hypothesis. Although their contribution was intertwined, genomic imbalances
  detectable by aCGH contributed only 25 of the transcriptional traits determining
  autologous tumor distinctiveness. Our study provides important insights about the
  dynamics of cancer progression and supports the development of targeted anticancer
  therapies aimed against stable genetic factors that are maintained throughout the
  end stage of disease.
