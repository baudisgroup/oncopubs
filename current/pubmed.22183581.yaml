abstract: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma HGSOC is characterized by genomic instability,
  ubiquitous TP53 loss, and frequent development of platinum resistance. Loss of homologous
  recombination HR is a mutator phenotype present in 50 of HGSOCs and confers hypersensitivity
  to platinum treatment. We asked which other mutator phenotypes are present in HGSOC
  and how they drive the emergence of platinum resistance. We performed whole-genome
  paired-end sequencing on a model of two HGSOC cases, each consisting of a pair of
  cell lines established before and after clinical resistance emerged, to describe
  their structural variants SVs and to infer their ancestral genomes as the SVs present
  within each pair. The first case PEO1 PEO4 , with HR deficiency, acquired translocations
  and small deletions through its early evolution, but a revertant BRCA2 mutation
  restoring HR function in the resistant lineage re-stabilized its genome and reduced
  platinum sensitivity. The second case PEO14 PEO23 had 216 tandem duplications and
  did not show evidence of HR or mismatch repair deficiency. By comparing the cell
  lines to the tissues from which they originated, we showed that the tandem duplicator
  mutator phenotype arose early in progression in vivo and persisted throughout evolution
  in vivo and in vitro, which may have enabled continual evolution. From the analysis
  of SNP array data from 454 HGSOC cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas series, we estimate
  that 12.8 of cases show patterns of aberrations similar to the tandem duplicator,
  and this phenotype is mutually exclusive with BRCA1 2 carrier mutations.
