abstract: In the present study, the distribution of genetic aberrations in a glioblastoma
  resection specimen of unusually large size 9x8x2 cm was investigated using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . CGH was performed on 20 samples taken from the specimen,
  and the genetic aberrations found were compared with the regional histology. The
  samples were histopathologically graded according to WHO criteria, and a division
  in high- and low-grade areas and infiltration rims was made. In high-grade areas,
  low-grade areas as well as infiltration rims, gains on 10p11.2-pter 14 20 , 11q12-q22
  6 20 and losses on 4q13-qter 9 20 , 10q22-qter 8 20 , 11p14-pter 5 20 , 13q12-qter
  7 20 were revealed. Gains on 1q21-32 2 4 and losses on 7p21-pter 3 4 were exclusively
  found in the high-grade areas. In the low-grade tumor samples and in the infiltration
  rim, gains on 16p11.2-pter 6 16 , 17p11.2-pter 6 16 , 17q11.2-qter 5 16 , 20q11.2-q13
  3 16 and deletions on 5q31-qter 4 16 were detected. Gains on 7q21-qter 8 11 and
  8q11.2-qter 6 11 , and loss of chromosome 9 4 11 and the Y-chromosome 4 11 were
  found in the high-grade and low-grade samples, not in the infiltration rims. The
  finding of a set of identical chromosomal aberrations throughout the resection specimen,
  most of which have been previously reported in gliomas, confirms a mechanism of
  clonal tumor proliferation operative in gliomas. The previously unreported genetic
  alterations which were predominantly traced in the tumor rims, might reflect either
  selection for properties related to infiltrating behavior, or genomic instability
  of subclones. The findings illustrate the importance of searching for high-grade
  genetic aberrations in low-grade tumor samples taken from cases in which sampling
  error is suspected.
