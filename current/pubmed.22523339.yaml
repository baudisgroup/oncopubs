abstract: Spindle cell lesions of the breast represent an interesting diagnostic challenge
  as they comprise a wide range of tumours that are rare. Differentiating dermatofibrosarcoma
  protuberans DFSP from other dermatofibromas using CD34 immunohistochemistry alone
  is difficult therefore, fluorescence in situ hybridisation FISH analysis is often
  employed to identify typical COL1A1-PDGFB fusion or gene rearrangement. Although
  molecular confirmation of diagnosis is unnecessary in the majority of DFSP cases,
  the detection of chromosomal rearrangement is valuable in tumours that show unusual
  clinicopathological features as in this study the authors report a case of DFSP
  of breast that did not show any typical known molecular features.
