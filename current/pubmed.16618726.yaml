abstract: 'To identify genetic changes involved in the progression of breast carcinoma,
  we did cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization CGH on a panel of breast tumors,
  including 10 ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS , 18 invasive breast carcinomas, and
  two lymph node metastases. We identified 49 minimal commonly amplified regions MCRs
  that included known 1q, 8q24, 11q13, 17q21-q23, and 20q13 and several uncharacterized
  12p13 and 16p13 regional copy number gains. With the exception of the 17q21 ERBB2
  amplicon, the overall frequency of copy number alterations was higher in invasive
  tumors than that in DCIS, with several of them present only in invasive cancer.
  Amplification of candidate loci was confirmed by quantitative PCR in breast carcinomas
  and cell lines. To identify putative targets of amplicons, we developed a method
  combining array CGH and serial analysis of gene expression SAGE data to correlate
  copy number and expression levels for each gene within MCRs. Using this approach,
  we were able to distinguish a few candidate targets from a set of coamplified genes.
  Analysis of the 12p13-p12 amplicon identified four putative targets: TEL ETV6, H2AFJ,
  EPS8, and KRAS2. The amplification of all four candidates was confirmed by quantitative
  PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization, but only H2AFJ and EPS8 were overexpressed
  in breast tumors with 12p13 amplification compared with a panel of normal mammary
  epithelial cells. These results show the power of combined array CGH and SAGE analysis
  for the identification of candidate amplicon targets and identify H2AFJ and EPS8
  as novel putative oncogenes in breast cancer.'
