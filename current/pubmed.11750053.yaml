abstract: Ionizing irradiation to the skull is a known risk factor for meningioma
  development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated
  meningioma RAM , we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by
  using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations
  with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas non-RAM . Most tumors 29 33 87.9 displayed
  at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 33 exhibited four or more
  changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs 2.4 -1.9
  and in non-RAMs 2.5 -1.9 . The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22
  56.2 in RAM, and 47 in non-RAM and chromosome 1 37.5 in RAM and 35.3 in non-RAM
  , with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA
  copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion,
  no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number
  of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses.
  These preliminary data suggest that the tumorogenic pathways of meningioma formation
  are similar, regardless of previous skull irradiation.
