abstract: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma AILT is a histopathologically well-defined
  entity. However, despite a number of cytogenetic studies, the genetic basis of this
  lymphoma entity is not clear. Moreover, there is an overlap to some cases of peripheral
  T-cell lymphoma unspecified PTCL-u in respect to morphological and genetic features.
  We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH to study genetic imbalances
  in 39 AILT and 20 PTCL-u. Array-based CGH revealed complex genetic imbalances in
  both AILT and PTCL-u. Chromosomal imbalances were more frequent in PTCL-u than in
  AILT and gains exceeded the losses. The most recurrent changes in AILT were gains
  of 22q, 19, and 11p11-q14 11q13 and losses of 13q. The most frequent changes in
  PTCL-u were gains of 17 17q11-q25 , 8 involving the MYC locus at 8q24 , and 22q
  and losses of 13q and 9 9p21-q33 . Interestingly, gains of 4q 4q28-q31 and 4q34-qtel
  , 8q24, and 17 were significantly more frequent in PTCL-u than in AILT. The regions
  6q 6q16-q22 and 11p11 were predominantly lost in PTCL-u. Moreover, we could identify
  a recurrent gain of 11q13 in both AILT and PTCL-u, which has previously not been
  described in AILT. Trisomies 3 and 5, which have been described as typical aberrations
  in AILT, were identified only in a small number of cases. In conclusion, CGH revealed
  common genetic events in peripheral T-cell lymphomas as well as peculiar differences
  between AILT and PTCL-u.
