abstract: Intimal sarcoma IS is defined as a malignant tumor arising in the tunica
  intima of large blood vessels. In systemic circulation, the majority of IS develop
  in the aorta, where close to three fourths of published cases lack specific differentiation
  and are called undifferentiated intimal sarcomas UIS . The remaining cases are intima-associated
  sarcomas of recognized types, also called differentiated intimal sarcomas DIS .
  In this report, we further characterize UIS, including its immunohistochemical profile
  and results of comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 14 cases of UIS were
  collected from 17 medical institutions, including slides, blocks, electron photomicrographs,
  clinical abstracts, and reports of surgical pathology specimens and autopsies. The
  patients, 7 women and 7 men, were 41 to 85 years of age median, 65.6 years . Twelve
  tumors arose from the aorta, one from the left external iliac and femoral arteries,
  and one in a large systemic vein the venous tumor was included due to histologic
  similarity with the arterial lesions . Tumors ranged from 1 cm to over 10 cm in
  diameter. Histopathology was that of a largely necrotic, poorly differentiated epithelioid
  and pleomorphic malignant neoplasm relating to the tunica intima. Usually there
  was only a thin layer of viable tumor cells overlying a large thrombus. All tumors
  stained at least focally with the endothelial markers CD31 and Fli-1 however, there
  was otherwise considerable variability in immunophenotype. The distinctive histopathologic
  appearance of the primary luminal lesion was lost whenever tumor invaded outside
  the vessel wall into adventitia and beyond or in metastatic sites. Such extravascular
  tumors assumed a variety of patterns reminiscent of undifferentiated pleomorphic
  sarcoma UPS in older literature also known as pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma,
  MFH or other distinct types of sarcomas, including osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma, and
  rhabdomyosarcoma. The results of comparative genomic hybridization were nonspecific.
  Eleven patients died of the disease, in an average of 11 months after diagnosis.
  Three patients are still alive and free of disease at 4, 16, and 27 years. UIS of
  large systemic vessels represents a distinct clinical entity where intraluminal
  sarcoma presents with thrombosis and occlusion of large vessels. It is associated
  with a highly characteristic, although not entirely specific, histology and immunohistochemical
  phenotype. The histogenesis of UIS is not certain however, it seems that the cell
  of origin must leave the confines of the vessel wall to show altered morphology.
  Although there are rare long-term survivors, UIS behaves as a fully malignant neoplasm
  that is almost uniformly associated with metastases and tumor-related death.
