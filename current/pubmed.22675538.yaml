abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Recurrent non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (NMTC) is a rare
  disease. We initially characterized 27 recurrent NMTC: 13 papillary thyroid cancers
  (PTC), 10 oncocytic follicular carcinomas (FTC-OV), and 4 non-oncocytic follicular
  carcinomas (FTC). A validation cohort composed of benign and malignant (both recurrent
  and non-recurrent) thyroid tumours was subsequently analysed (n = 20). METHODS:
  Data from genome-wide SNP arrays and flow cytometry were combined to determine the
  chromosomal dosage (allelic state) in these tumours, including mutation analysis
  of components of PIK3CA/AKT and MAPK pathways. RESULTS: All FTC-OVs showed a very
  distinct pattern of genomic alterations. Ten out of 10 FTC-OV cases showed near-haploidisation
  with or without subsequent genome endoreduplication. Near-haploidisation was seen
  in 5/10 as extensive chromosome-wide monosomy (allelic state [A]) with near-haploid
  DNA indices and retention of especially chromosome 7 (seen as a heterozygous allelic
  state [AB]). In the remaining 5/10 chromosomal allelic states AA with near diploid
  DNA indices were seen with allelic state AABB of chromosome 7, suggesting endoreduplication
  after preceding haploidisation. The latter was supported by the presence of both
  near-haploid and endoreduplicated tumour fractions in some of the cases. Results
  were confirmed using FISH analysis. Relatively to FTC-OV limited numbers of genomic
  alterations were identified in other types of recurrent NMTC studied, except for
  chromosome 22q which showed alterations in 6 of 13 PTCs. Only two HRAS, but no mutations
  of EGFR or BRAF were found in FTC-OV. The validation cohort showed two additional
  tumours with the distinct pattern of genomic alterations (both with oncocytic features
  and recurrent). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that recurrent FTC-OV is frequently
  characterised by genome-wide DNA haploidisation, heterozygous retention of chromosome
  7, and endoreduplication of a near-haploid genome. Whether normal gene dosage on
  especially chromosome 7 (containing EGFR, BRAF, cMET) is crucial for FTC-OV tumour
  survival is an important topic for future research. MICROARRAYS: Data are made available
  at GEO (GSE31828).'
