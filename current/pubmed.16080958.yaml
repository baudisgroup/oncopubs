abstract: Peritoneal metastasis is an important prognostic factor in cases of gastric
  cancer. Although studies on comparative genomic hybridization CGH in gastric cancer
  have been reported, there are few reports on the peritoneal metastasis P and peritoneal
  cytology CY factors in this cancer. In this study, we analyzed the chromosomal changes
  in the primary tumor with a combination of laser microdissection analysis and CGH
  in an attempt to detect the unknown abnormal chromosomal regions. We analyzed 34
  primary tumors, including 13 primary tumors with peritoneal metastasis P1 and or
  positive peritoneal cytology CY1 using a combination of laser microdissection and
  CGH. The minimal overlapping regions in gains were assigned to 5p14 46.2 , 7q21.3
  61.5 , 7q31 46.2 , 7q36 46.2 , 8q23 53.8 , 15q26 46.2 , 20q12 61.5 , 20q13.1 53.8
  , and 20q13.2 53.8 in primary tumors with P1 and or CY1. The minimal regions of
  losses that occurred most frequently were 4q34-q35 23.1 and 22q11.2 23.1 . There
  were significant differences in the minimal regions of 5p14 P 0.033 , 7q21.3 P amp
  lt 0.0001 , 7q31 P 0.013 , 7q36 P 0.033 , and 22q11.2 P 0.048 between primary tumors
  with and without P1 and or CY1. In this study, gain amplification of 5p14, 7q21.3,
  7q31, and 7q36, and loss of 22q11.2 were significant in gastric cancer cases with
  peritoneal dissemination and or positive peritoneal cytology.
