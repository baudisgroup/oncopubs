abstract: Pleuropulmonary blastomas are rare malignant intrathoracic tumors of early
  childhood. They appear as a pulmonary- and or pleural-based mass and their pathogenesis
  and relationship to other pediatric solid tumors is not well understood. In this
  study, paraffin-embedded material of five cases of pleuropulmonary blastoma was
  analyzed for genetic alterations by comparative genomic hybridization and five genetic
  loci by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization identified
  aberrations in all pleuropulmonary blastomas, including four amplifications in three
  tumors at chromosomes 5q33-34, 11q22.2-ter, 15q25-ter, and 19q11-13.2. The most
  frequent DNA gains involved 8q11-22.2 four cases and 20q two cases , whereas the
  most common losses included 9p21-24 two cases and 11p14 three cases . Chromosome
  8 gains were confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, resulting in the detection
  of up to five copies of chromosome 8 centromeres per nucleus. In the two surviving
  patients, chromosome 8 gains were the only genetic abnormality, suggesting that
  this might be an early event in pleuropulmonary blastoma carcinogenesis. The identification
  of new genetic alterations as well as the confirmation of previously reported ones
  especially 8q gains in pleuropulmonary blastoma should help to improve our understanding
  of both the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis of pleuropulmonary
  blastoma and the relationship of pleuropulmonary blastoma with other pediatric tumors.
