abstract: 'Array-CGH is a powerful tool for the detection of chromosomal aberrations.
  The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic profiling,
  termed SNP-CGH, represents a further advance, since simultaneous measurement of
  both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic composition makes it possible
  to detect both copy number changes and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity LOH events.
  We demonstrate the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping
  BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal aberrations
  in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well tumor samples at sub-100 kb
  effective resolution. Detected aberrations include homozygous deletions, hemizygous
  deletions, copy-neutral LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability
  to detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome titration
  model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration of gDNA from a tumor cell
  with that of its paired normal cell line. Analysis was facilitated by using a genome
  browser that plots log ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along
  the chromosomes. We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and
  a paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity ratios and allelic
  ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters generated from approximately
  120 reference samples, whereas the paired sample mode uses a paired normal reference
  sample from the same individual. Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and
  contrasted for their utility in analyzing different types of input gDNA: low input
  amounts, fragmented gDNA, and Phi29 whole-genome pre-amplified DNA.'
