abstract: "Oncogenic mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) predict
  prognosis and therapeutic responses to imatinib. In wild-type GISTs, the tumor-initiating
  events are still unknown, and wild-type GISTs are resistant to imatinib therapy.
  We performed an association study between copy number alterations (CNAs) identified
  from array CGH and gene expression analyses results for four wild-type GISTs and
  an imatinib-resistant PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST, and compared the results to those
  obtained from 27 GISTs with KIT mutations. All wild-type GISTs had multiple CNAs,
  and CNAs in 1p and 22q that harbor the SDHB and GSTT1 genes, respectively, correlated
  well with expression levels of these genes. mRNA expression levels of all SDH gene
  subunits were significantly lower (Pâ\x89¤0.041), whereas mRNA expression levels
  of VEGF (P=0.025), IGF1R (P=0.026), and ZNFs (P<0.05) were significantly higher
  in GISTs with wild-type/PDGFRA D842V mutations than GISTs with KIT mutations. qRT-PCR
  validation of the GSTT1 results in this cohort and 11 additional malignant GISTs
  showed a significant increase in the frequency of GSTT1 CN gain and increased mRNA
  expression of GSTT1 in wild-type/PDGFRA D842V GISTs than KIT-mutant GISTs (P=0.033).
  Surprisingly, all four malignant GISTs with KIT exon 11 deletion mutations with
  primary resistance to imatinib had an increased GSTT1 CN and mRNA expression level
  of GSTT1. Increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 and ZNF could be predictors of a poor
  response to imatinib. Our integrative approach reveals that for patients with wild-type
  (or imatinib-resistant) GISTs, attempts to target VEGFRs and IGF1R may be reasonable
  options."
