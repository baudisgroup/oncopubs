abstract: 'Approximately 10 of ulcerative colitis patients develop colorectal neoplasia.
  At present, identification of this subset is markedly limited and necessitates lifelong
  colonoscopic surveillance for the entire ulcerative colitis population. Better risk
  markers are needed to focus surveillance onto the patients who are most likely to
  benefit. Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, we analyzed single,
  non-dysplastic biopsies from three patient groups: ulcerative colitis progressors
  n 9 with cancer or high-grade dysplasia at a mean distance of 18 cm from the analyzed
  site ulcerative colitis non-progressors n 8 without dysplasia during long-term surveillance
  and non-ulcerative colitis normal controls n 2 . Genomic DNA from fresh colonic
  epithelium purified from stroma was hybridized to 287 low-density and 4342 higher-density
  feature bacterial artificial chromosome arrays. Sample-to-reference fluorescence
  ratios were calculated for individual chromosomal targets and globally across the
  genome. The low-density arrays yielded pronounced genomic gains and losses in 3
  of 9 33 ulcerative colitis progressors but in none of the 10 control patients. Identical
  DNA samples analyzed on the higher-density arrays, using a combination of global
  and individual high variance assessments, distinguished all nine progressors from
  all 10 controls. These data confirm that genomic alterations in ulcerative colitis
  progressors are widespread, even involving single non-dysplastic biopsies that are
  far distant from neoplasia. They therefore show promise toward eliminating full
  colonoscopic surveillance with extensive biopsy sampling in the majority of ulcerative
  colitis patients.'
