abstract: The case of a soft tissue myoepithelioma is presented including clinicopathologic,
  ultrastructural, and genetic findings. A 30-year-old male patient suffered from
  a soft tissue tumor within the deep soft tissues of the right lower leg measuring
  13.2 x 8.2 x 9 cm. Histologically, the lesion was diagnosed as a myoepithelioma
  displaying a lobulated architecture with cords and nests of epithelioid and spindle
  cells without cytologic atypia lying within a fibromyxoid and partly chondroid matrix
  immunohistochemistry was positive for pancytokeratin, S100-protein, calponin and
  partly for GFAP and EMA. Ultrastructural analysis revealed glycogen deposits and
  cell-membrane-associated plaque structures, whereas true myofilaments could not
  be identified with immunohistochemistry being negative for actin . Using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , a gain of chromosome Y was detected. A loss on 17p could
  not be detected unambiguously. However, based on the low resolution of CGH a small
  loss cannot be excluded. The patient was free of disease 25 months following complete
  tumor resection. Myoepitheliomas mixed tumors of deep soft tissue represent rare
  soft tissue lesions that may reach a considerable size and may mimic other soft
  tissue tumors or sarcomas. Based on a local relapse rate of approximately 20 according
  to the literature, a complete resection with thorough follow-up should be recommended.
