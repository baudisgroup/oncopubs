abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH represents a new technique for global
  analysis of a whole genome for net loss or gain of chromosome regions. It offers
  several advantages over alternative techniques. It permits analysis of a whole genome
  in a single hybridization reaction, it does not require the generation of metaphases
  from tumor cells, and it only requires very small numbers of tumor cells. Most previous
  studies have concentrated on the application of CGH to the analysis of chromosome
  defects associated with solid tumors. In this paper we report the use of CGH to
  study bone marrow samples from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and complex
  karyotypic abnormalities. The results obtained using CGH were compared with G-banding
  analysis. Both G-banding and CGH detected a 5q deletion, a 7q deletion, additional
  material derived from 8q, and an HSR on 11q. However, several apparently discrepant
  results were also obtained. Paints for chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 22,
  and X were therefore used to resolve these differences. Our results demonstrate
  that CGH detected chromosome abnormalities associated with acute myeloid leukemia
  and that CGH provided information that was not obtained by G-banding analysis alone.
  These data suggest that CGH may prove a useful adjunct to conventional cytogenetic
  and molecular analysis of hematologic malignancies.
