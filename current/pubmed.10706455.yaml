abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis was performed on bone marrow
  specimens from 19 children with acute myeloid leukemia AML at diagnosis. The results
  of CGH were compared to those of conventional cytogenetic analysis. The most common
  CGH aberrations were gains of whole chromosomes 6 and 8, both of which appeared
  three times. Two losses were seen twice losses of whole chromosomes 7 and X. The
  CGH findings were concordant with the results of conventional karyotyping. CGH did
  not add new information to the karyotypes. Since no high-level amplification was
  found among the samples and standard karyotyping was highly successful, we do not
  advocate routine use of CGH in the diagnostic evaluation of childhood AML.
