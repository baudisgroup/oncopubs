abstract: We previously conducted a phase-II study with selumetinib (AZD6244), a small
  molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2, in advanced biliary tract cancers (BTC), where the
  primary endpoint was response rate. Several patients experienced objective response.
  These findings were confirmed with MEK162 in a similar patient population. To assess
  for tumor-specific genetic variants that mediate sensitivity to MEK inhibition in
  BTC, we performed whole-exome sequencing in patients with an objective response
  to selumetinib. Normal and tumor DNA from FFPE tissue from two patients who experienced
  an objective response underwent whole-exome sequencing. Raw sequence reads were
  processed with GATK workflow and tumor specific variants were identified using MuTect
  and VarScan2. Ensemble Variant Effect Predictor was used to determine functional
  consequences of these variants. Copy number changes and potential gene fusion events
  were also screened. Findings were compared to assess for any commonality between
  the two tumor samples, and whether the identified variants were intrinsic to the
  MAPK pathway. 1169 and 628 tumor-specific variants were identified in the two samples.
  Further analysis demonstrated 60 and 53 functional and novel variants, respectively.
  Of the identified tumor-specific variants, fusion events or copy number changes,
  no commonality was seen. Several variants in genes associated with ERK signaling
  were present in each tumor sample. Although there were no common tumor-specific
  variants in the two patients who exhibited an objective response to selumetinib,
  several genes associated with ERK signaling were identified. Confirmatory studies
  investigating the role of the identified genes and other potential tumor independent
  factors need further investigation.
