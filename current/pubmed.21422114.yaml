abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Alterations of the short arm of chromosome 12 12p occur in
  various hematologic malignancies and ETV6 and CDKN1B, which are located on 12p,
  have been implicated as leukemogenic genes of interest. DESIGN AND METHODS: We selected
  seven patients with myeloid malignancies and small 12p deletions detected by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization encompassing only the region centromeric of ETV6 and further
  evaluated them by single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. RESULTS: The minimally
  deleted region contained only nine genes. These genes were subsequently analyzed
  by microarray expression profiling in an independent cohort of 781 patients, most,
  but not all, of whom had different hematologic malignancies CREBL2, MANSC1, and
  CDKN1B were expressed in more than 25 of cases, while the other six genes were expressed
  in only a minority of cases. As CDKN1B is a cell cycle regulator and functions as
  a tumor suppressor gene, this gene was selected for further expression studies in
  286 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. When comparing patients with low CDKN1B
  expression expression level lt 1,160 1st quartile with those with intermediate or
  high expression 2nd-4th quartiles , certain mutations were observed more frequently
  in the former: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 11 83, 13.3 versus 5 203 2.5 P 0.001 , PML-RARA rearrangements
  11 83, 13.3 versus 4 203, 2.0 P lt 0.001 , 11q23 MLL rearrangements 6 83, 7.2 versus
  4 203, 2.0 P 0.038 , and FLT3-TKD mutations 7 63, 11.1 versus 6 167, 3.6 P 0.047
  . The median overall survival of patients with low CDKN1B expression was longer
  than that of patients with intermediate high expression not reached versus 14.9
  months P 0.005 . Likewise, patients with low CDKN1B expression had a longer event-free
  survival than those with intermediate high expression 31.0 versus 9.7 months P 0.013
  . CONCLUSIONS: CDKN1B is an interesting candidate gene as a potential biomarker
  for prognostication in acute myeloid leukemia.'

title: CDKN1B, encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27), is located
  in the minimally deleted region of 12p abnormalities in myeloid malignancies and
  its low expression is a favorable prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukemia.
