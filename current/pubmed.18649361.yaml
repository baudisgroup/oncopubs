abstract: We tried to establish models that predict systemic recurrence in breast
  cancer by selecting marker clones with DNA copy number alterations CNAs using an
  array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Array CGH containing 4,044 human bacterial
  artificial chromosome clones was used to assess CNAs in 62 primary breast cancer
  tissues from 31 patients with systemic recurrence within 5 years after surgery and
  clinicopathologically well matched 31 patients who had no evidence of disease for
  at least 5years. Fourteen significant clones 11 clones showing gain and 3 showing
  loss were identified by systemic recurrence-free survival SRFS analysis and 23 significant
  clones 17 clones showing gain and 6 showing loss identified by chi 2 test and FDR
  test were selected as predictive markers of systemic breast cancer recurrence. The
  significant CNAs were found in the chromosomal regions of 5p15.33, 11q13.3, 15q26.3,
  17q25.3, 18q23 and 21q22.3 with gain and 9p12, 11q24.1 and 14q32.33 with loss. We
  devised 2 prediction models for the systemic recurrence of breast cancer based on
  the 14 clones and the 23 clones, respectively. The survivals of the patients were
  significantly separated according to the scores from each model at the optimal cut
  off values in SRFS and overall survival analysis. We found candidate clones and
  genes of which CNAs were significantly associated with systemic recurrence of breast
  cancer. The devised prediction models with these clones were effective at differentiating
  the recurrence and nonrecurrence.
