abstract: 'Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma PMBL is an aggressive extranodal B-cell
  non-Hodgkins lymphoma with specific clinical, histopathological and genomic features.
  To characterize further the genotype of PMBL, we analyzed 37 tumor samples and PMBL
  cell lines Med-B1 and Karpas1106P using array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  matrix- or array-CGH to a 2.8k genomic microarray. Due to a higher genomic resolution,
  we identified altered chromosomal regions in much higher frequencies compared with
  standard CGH: for example, 9p24 68 , 2p15 51 , 7q22 32 , 9q34 32 , 11q23 18 , 12q
  30 and 18q21 24 . Moreover, previously unknown small interstitial chromosomal low
  copy number alterations for example, -6p21, -11q13.3 and a total of 19 DNA amplifications
  were identified by array-CGH. For 17 chromosomal localizations 10 gains and 7 losses
  , which were altered in more than 10 of the analyzed cases, we delineated minimal
  consensus regions based on genomic base pair positions. These regions and selected
  immunohistochemistries point to candidate genes that are discussed in the context
  of NF-kappaB transcription activation, human leukocyte antigen class I II defects,
  impaired apoptosis and Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription
  JAK STAT activation. Our data confirm the genomic uniqueness of this tumor and provide
  physically mapped genomic regions of interest for focused candidate gene analysis.'
