abstract: In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of
  cancer-related deaths among women. The most important prognostic factor for this
  cancer is tumor stage, or extent of disease at diagnosis. Although women with low-stage
  tumors have a relatively good prognosis, most women diagnosed with late-stage disease
  eventually succumb to their cancer. In an attempt to understand early events in
  ovarian carcinogenesis, and to explore steps in its progression, we have applied
  multiple molecular genetic techniques to the analysis of 21 early-stage stage I
  II and 17 advanced-stage stage III IV ovarian tumors. These techniques included
  expression profiling with cDNA microarrays containing approximately 18,000 expressed
  sequences, and comparative genomic hybridization to address the chromosomal locations
  of copy number gains as well as losses. Results from the analysis indicate that
  early-stage ovarian cancers exhibit profound alterations in gene expression, many
  of which are similar to those identified in late-stage tumors. However, differences
  observed at the genomic level suggest differences between the early- and late-stage
  tumors and provide support for a progression model for ovarian cancer development.
