abstract: Prostate cancer is clinically heterogeneous, ranging from indolent to lethal
  disease. Expression profiling previously defined three subtypes of prostate cancer,
  one subtype-1 linked to clinically favorable behavior, and the others subtypes-2
  and -3 linked with a more aggressive form of the disease. To explore disease heterogeneity
  at the genomic level, we carried out array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array CGH on 64 prostate tumor specimens, including 55 primary tumors and 9 pelvic
  lymph node metastases. Unsupervised cluster analysis of DNA copy number alterations
  CNA identified recurrent aberrations, including a 6q15-deletion group associated
  with subtype-1 gene expression patterns and decreased tumor recurrence. Supervised
  analysis further disclosed distinct patterns of CNA among gene-expression subtypes,
  where subtype-1 tumors exhibited characteristic deletions at 5q21 and 6q15, and
  subtype-2 cases harbored deletions at 8p21 NKX3-1 and 21q22 resulting in TMPRSS2-ERG
  fusion . Lymph node metastases, predominantly subtype-3, displayed overall higher
  frequencies of CNA, and in particular gains at 8q24 MYC and 16p13, and loss at 10q23
  PTEN and 16q23. Our findings reveal that prostate cancers develop via a limited
  number of alternative preferred genetic pathways. The resultant molecular genetic
  subtypes provide a new framework for investigating prostate cancer biology and explain
  in part the clinical heterogeneity of the disease.
