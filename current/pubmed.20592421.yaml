abstract: Distinct molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas have been identified, but
  translation into clinical use has been limited. We have developed two platform-independent
  algorithms to explore genomic architectural distortion using array comparative genomic
  hybridization data to measure (i) whole-arm gains and losses [whole-arm aberration
  index (WAAI)] and (ii) complex rearrangements [complex arm aberration index (CAAI)].
  By applying CAAI and WAAI to data from 595 breast cancer patients, we were able
  to separate the cases into eight subgroups with different distributions of genomic
  distortion. Within each subgroup data from expression analyses, sequencing and ploidy
  indicated that progression occurs along separate paths into more complex genotypes.
  Histological grade had prognostic impact only in the luminal-related groups, whereas
  the complexity identified by CAAI had an overall independent prognostic power. This
  study emphasizes the relation among structural genomic alterations, molecular subtype,
  and clinical behavior and shows that objective score of genomic complexity (CAAI)
  is an independent prognostic marker in breast cancer.
