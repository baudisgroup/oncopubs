abstract: Although several cytogenetic events of the tumor progression cascade have
  been identified in the past, the specific types of chromosomal alterations that
  lead to the development of lymph node metastases are still unknown. Operative specimens
  of 20 patients 10 patients with metastasizing tumors, 10 patients with nonmetastasizing
  tumors with squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx and hypopharynx, along with
  the corresponding lymph node metastases, were investigated by quantitative DNA measurements
  and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Nonmetastasizing tumors N0 displayed
  overrepresentations on chromosomes 10q 8 cases 5p 7 cases 3q and 20q 6 cases each
  8q 5 cases 1p and 21q 4 cases each 7p and 20p 3 cases each and 2p, 15q, and 19q
  2 cases each . Loss of chromosomal material was found on 5q, 9p, and 14q 2 cases
  each . Metastasizing tumors N demonstrated overrepresentations on chromosomes 5p,
  15q, and 22q 6 cases each 3q and 11q13 5 cases each 20p and 21q 4 cases each and
  10q 3 cases . In 2 cases, an overrepresentation of the chromosomal arm 3q was accompanied
  by a loss of chromosomal arm 3p. Less frequent overrepresentations were observed
  on chromosomes 1q and 17q. Deletions were found on chromosomes 18q 3 cases , 3p,
  4q, 5q, and 19p 2 cases each and sporadic deletions occurred on 2q, 6q, 8p, 9p,
  10p, 13q, 14q, 15q, and 16q. Whereas overrepresentations on chromosomes 1p and 7p
  occurred exclusively in N0 tumors, overrepresentations on chromosomes 1q, 11q, and
  22q, along with deletions on 18q, were only observed in N tumors. Quantitative DNA
  measurements revealed a significantly higher percentage of aneuploid cells and a
  higher degree of DNA entropy in the N tumors. Chromosomal overrepresentations on
  chromosomes 1q, 8q, 11q, 18q, and 19q occurred more frequently in the metastases
  than in the corresponding primary tumors. Pairwise analysis of chromosomal alterations
  in the primary tumors and associated lymph node metastases revealed a genetic relationship,
  although a greater number of chromosomes on average were affected in the lymph node
  metastases. Quantitative DNA measurements demonstrated greater aneuploid values
  in the metastases. Recurring patterns of chromosomal alterations in N0 and N tumors
  were demonstrated in this study. In general, metastasizing tumors are characterized
  by overrepresentations on chromosomes 11q13 and 22q, and deletions on 18q. These
  aberrations suggest an elevation along the tumor progression cascade.
