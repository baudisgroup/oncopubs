abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was applied to 5 breast cancer cell lines
  and 33 primary tumors to discover and map regions of the genome with increased DNA-sequence
  copy-number. Two-thirds of primary tumors and almost all cell lines showed increased
  DNA-sequence copy-number affecting a total of 26 chromosomal subregions. Most of
  these loci were distinct from those of currently known amplified genes in breast
  cancer, with sequences originating from 17q22-q24 and 20q13 showing the highest
  frequency of amplification. The results indicate that these chromosomal regions
  may contain previously unknown genes whose increased expression contributes to breast
  cancer progression. Chromosomal regions with increased copy-number often spanned
  tens of Mb, suggesting involvement of more than one gene in each region.
