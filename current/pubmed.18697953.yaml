abstract: We have employed a laser-capture microdissection technique and single-nucleotide
  polymorphism arrays to characterize genomic alterations associated with the development
  of glioblastoma multiforme GBM . Combined analysis of loss of heterozygosity LOH
  and copy number revealed that more than half 56.3 of the 254 identified LOH loci
  showed no copy-number alteration, indicating the presence of copy-number neutral
  LOH cnLOH . Furthermore, we found a GBM case that showed cnLOH in 18 of the 22 autosomes.
  These results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR, microsatellite analysis,
  and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The high rate of cnLOH suggests that epigenetic
  abnormalities of many genes are involved in the development and progression of GBMs.
