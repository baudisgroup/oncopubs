abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was performed on 38 primary laryngeal
  carcinomas divided into two groups according to the metastatic phenotype. DNA copy
  number changes were detected in 22 of the 38 cases 57.9 . Gains were most frequently
  observed at 3q, 8q, and 9q, and losses were found in decreasing order at 18q, 3p,
  and 4. The mean value of losses was 2.5 times as high in metastasizing primary tumors
  23 38 as in nonmetastasizing tumors. The most frequent losses in metastasizing tumors
  were at 18q, 3p, and 5q.
