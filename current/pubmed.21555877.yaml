abstract: Gliosarcoma, a rare glioblastoma variant, is composed of a glial and a mesenchymal
  component. Though the mesenchymal portion most commonly resembles a fibrosarcoma,
  other differentiation patterns have been observed. We present the first genomic
  characterisation karyotyping followed by FISH and array comparative genomic hybridisation
  analysis of a gliosarcoma with osseous metaplasia. In addition to chromosomal changes
  often found in gliomas 7, -10, -13, and -22 , the tumour cells also harboured a
  hitherto unknown t 3 21 q13 approximately 21 q21 approximately 22 .
