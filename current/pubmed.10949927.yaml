abstract: To discriminate among the chromosomal abnormalities associated with the
  etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC , we performed a comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis on 34 HCCs resected on non-cirrhotic livers from patients serologically
  negative for both hepatitis B HBV and C HCV viruses. The results were compared to
  those of a previous analysis of 50 HCCs selected on the basis of their positivity
  for HBV infection. The majority of the abnormalities found in the HBV positive cases
  losses of chromosome arms 1p, 8p, 6q, 13q and 14q and gains of 1q, 8q, 6p and 17q
  were similarly detected in the virus negative specimens. In contrast, a significant
  decrease 40 on average was observed for losses at 4q, 16q and 17p in non-viral HCC
  samples, suggesting that these abnormalities are tightly associated with HBV infection.
  Thus, in addition to a common pathway towards malignancy, a subset of alterations
  may preferentially contribute to virus-induced carcinogenesis. In a parallel CGH
  study of 10 fibrolamellar carcinomas, a rare subtype of HCC, we found in six out
  of the seven informative cases, gains of chromosome arm 1q. This region, which is
  also preferentially amplified in non fibrolamellar tumors 58 , may contain an essential
  proto-oncogene commonly implicated in liver carcinogenesis.
