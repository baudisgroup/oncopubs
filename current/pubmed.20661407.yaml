abstract: Melanocytic neoplasms with spitzoid features including spitz nevi, spitz
  tumors and spitzoid melanomas are commonly encountered in the practice of dermatopathology.
  Although many cases can be accurately diagnosed on the basis of morphology and histology,
  a significant number of cases may be difficult to accurately classify. Several studies
  have now shown that chromosomal copy number aberrations are typical of melanoma
  while present in only a small percent and to a limited degree in spitz nevi. In
  this study, we correlated the clinical, histologic and array CGH findings of 10
  spiztoid melanocytic neoplasms. Our study shows that the clinical and histologic
  changes correlate well with the molecular findings by array CGH. Further that array
  CGH can be used to help classify and predict behavior of spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms.
  A limited variety of copy number aberrations including gains of 11p and much more
  rarely 7q may be seen in spitz nevi. Additionally in this report we present the
  first case of a typical spitz nevus with copy number gains involving both 7q and
  11p. Conversely, melanomas with spitzoid features typically have multiple chromsomal
  copy number aberrations involving a variety of loci. A smaller number of chromosomal
  aberrations, possibly a single aberrant locus, may be present in spitz tumors, but
  their presence may predict more aggressive behavior.
