abstract: 'Due to problems with primary tumor cell culture, conventional cytogenetics
  has yielded little insightful information on chromosomal alterations in prostate
  cancer. The primary aim of this study was to define the ability of comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH to detect and map genetic deletions in prostate tumors. A secondary
  aim was to apply multiple assays to individual tumors as a means of deciphering
  the mechanisms of genetic alterations in prostate cancer. CGH results were compared
  with allelic imbalance measurements at 29 distinct loci on chromosome 8 in 18 specimens
  17 malignant and 1 benign . CGH detected no changes in cases where all informative
  PCR RFLP loci were retained and detected all p arm deletions consisting of at least
  two loci. We estimate that in this study, the smallest deletions detected by CGH
  were approximately 20-30 cM. Physical mapping of subchromosomal arm deletions by
  CGH correlated well with allelic imbalance mapping by PCR RFLP: The data agreed
  at 88 of loci on 8p and 92 of loci on 8q. Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  with multiple centromere probes and DNA content flow cytometry FCM also was performed
  on selected specimens. FISH revealed two cases of chromosome 8 aneusomy. In these
  two cases and three others, CGH showed simultaneous p arm deletion and q arm gain,
  suggesting isochromosome 8q formation. Together, these data suggested that, simple
  chromosomal aberrations were responsible for allelic losses on 8p and allelic gains
  on 8q in a significant number of prostate tumors. We also used CGH to examine relative
  DNA sequence copy number throughout the genome. Changes frequently associated with
  8p loss include gains of 8q and losses of 13q, 16p, 16q, 17p, 17q, 20q, and Y. Cases
  with 8p loss exhibited five times the number of alterations as did cases without
  8p loss.'
