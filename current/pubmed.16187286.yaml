abstract: Chromosomal regions harboring tumor suppressors and oncogenes are often
  deleted or amplified. Array comparative genomic hybridization detects segmental
  DNA copy number alterations in tumor DNA relative to a normal control. The recent
  development of a bacterial artificial chromosome array, which spans the human genome
  in a tiling path manner with amp gt 32,000 clones, has facilitated whole genome
  profiling at an unprecedented resolution. Using this technology, we comprehensively
  describe and compare the genomes of 28 commonly used non-small cell lung carcinoma
  NSCLC cell models, derived from 18 adenocarcinomas AC , 9 squamous cell carcinomas
  and 1 large cell carcinoma. Analysis at such resolution not only provided a detailed
  genomic alteration template for each of these model cell lines, but revealed novel
  regions of frequent duplication and deletion. Significantly, a detailed analysis
  of chromosome 7 identified 6 distinct regions of alterations across this chromosome,
  implicating the presence of multiple novel oncogene loci on this chromosome. As
  well, a comparison between the squamous and AC cells revealed alterations common
  to both subtypes, such as the loss of 3p and gain of 5p, in addition to multiple
  hotspots more frequently associated with only 1 subtype. Interestingly, chromosome
  3q, which is known to be amplified in both subtypes, showed 2 distinct regions of
  alteration, 1 frequently altered in squamous and 1 more frequently altered in AC.
  In summary, our data demonstrate the unique information generated by high resolution
  analysis of NSCLC genomes and uncover the presence of genetic alterations prevalent
  in the different NSCLC subtypes.
