abstract: In a case of a 67-year-old man with two different early stages of a predominantly
  epithelioid mesothelioma amp quot mesothelioma in situ amp quot , amp quot early-stage
  mesothelioma amp quot , chromosomal imbalances were determined by comparative genomic
  hybridisation CGH , a molecular cytogenetic technique to detect chromosomal gains
  and losses in tumour cells. In the case of the mesothelioma in situ cells, nine
  different chromosomal alterations could be detected losses on 3p, 5q, 6q, 8p, 9p,
  15q, 22q, Y gain on 7q , whereas the early-stage mesothelioma showed the same defects
  except for the gain on 7q. The simultaneous losses of 6q, 9p and 22q, as well as
  other chromosomal regions, correlate well with the most common defects previously
  found in 90 cases of more-advanced-stage mesotheliomas using CGH. These data demonstrate
  that initial chromosomal defects in early stages of mesotheliomas can be detected
  by conventional CGH in combination with laser microdissection. The molecular cytogenetic
  findings support the histological diagnosis of a pleural mesothelioma. The surprisingly
  high number and extent of genomic alterations found in the examined case probably
  reflects the genomic instability in the tumour cells and indicates a amp quot genetic
  chaos amp quot even in earlier stages of malignant mesotheliomas.
