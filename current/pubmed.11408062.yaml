abstract: In order to define and map chromosomal copy number alterations in salivary
  gland tumors SGTs , a comparative genomic hybridization CGH technique was applied
  to two pleomorphic adenomas PAs , one adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC , and one basal
  cell adenocarcinoma BCAC . The PAs exhibited regional copy number losses at 5q12.4-q14.1,
  9q12-q21.13, and 16q11.2, as well as a gain at 20p12.1 among these, the losses at
  the 9q12-q21.11 and 16q11.2 regions were common to both PAs. The ACC showed overrepresentations
  of the entire regions of chromosomes 16 and 20, a regional gain at 22q12.3-q13.1,
  and no losses. In the BCAC, regional gains at 9p21.1-pter, 18q21.1-q22.3, and 22q11.23-q13.31
  as well as losses at 2q24.2 and 4q25-q27 were seen the gain at 22q12.3-q13.1 was
  common in both the ACC and the BCAC. These CGH data indicate that different genetic
  alterations are present in the different types of SGTs, and that the alterations
  involve several chromosomes. The discovery of common alterations in the same and
  or different types of tumors might be important in the understanding of the development
  and progression of the SGTs.
