abstract: Patients with mantle cell lymphoma MCL may present with either nodal or
  leukemic disease. The molecular determinants underlying this different biologic
  behavior are not known. This study compared the pattern of genetic abnormalities
  in patients with nodal and leukemic phases of MCL using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH for specific gene loci. Although
  both leukemic and nodal MCL showed similar genomic patterns of losses involving
  6q, 11q22-q23, 13q14, and 17p13 and gains affecting 3q and 8q , genomic loss of
  chromosome 8p occurred more frequently in patients with leukemic disease 79 versus
  11 , P amp lt .001 . Subsequent CGH analysis confirmed the genomic loss of 8p21-p23
  in 6 of 8 MCL cell lines. Interestingly, MYC gene amplification was restricted to
  cases with 8p deletion. These data indicate the presence of a novel tumor suppressor
  gene locus on 8p, whose deletion may be associated with leukemic dissemination and
  poor prognosis in patients with MCL.
