abstract: The epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT of malignant hepatocytes is
  a crucial event in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC progression and recurrence. We aimed
  to establish a human model of EMT to examine drug efficacy and specificity in HCC
  progression. Human HCC cell populations were characterized by immunofluorescence
  analysis, migration and invasion assays, array comparative genomic hybridization,
  whole-genome expression profiling, and promoter methylation. Therapeutic agents
  clinically used against HCC were examined for efficacy by determination of IC 50
  values. We show that liver cancer cell lines exhibited either an epithelial or mesenchymal
  phenotype of which the latter showed strong migratory and invasive abilities in
  vitro. The common cellular origin of both cell types indicated that mesenchymal
  HCC cells have been derived from epithelial hepatocytes through EMT in the HCC patient.
  Drug exposure of mesenchymal HCC cells showed higher resistance to the targeted
  therapeutic agents sorafenib and erlotinib as compared to epithelial HCC cells,
  which were slightly more resistant to cytostatic drugs. Most remarkably, combined
  treatment with doxorubicin and sorafenib caused increased susceptibility of both
  HCC cell types resulting in enhanced drug efficacy. Taken together, this EMT model
  of human HCC allows the identification of molecular mechanisms and the assessment
  of therapeutic drug efficacy during liver cancer progression in preclinical studies.
