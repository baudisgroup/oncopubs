abstract: Infiltrating lobular breast cancer ILBC is a clinically and biologically
  distinct tumour entity defined by a characteristic linear cord invasion pattern
  and inactivation of the CDH1 tumour suppressor gene encoding for E-cadherin. ILBCs
  also lack beta-catenin expression and show aberrant cytoplasmic localization of
  the E-cadherin binding protein p120-catenin. The lack of a well-characterized ILBC
  cell line has hampered the functional characterization of ILBC cells in vitro. We
  report the establishment of a permanent ILBC cell line, named IPH-926, which was
  derived from a patient with metastatic ILBC. The DNA fingerprint of IPH-926 verified
  genetic identity with the patient and had no match among the human cell line collections
  of several international biological resource banks. IPH-926 expressed various epithelial
  cell markers but lacked expression of E-cadherin due to a previously unreported,
  homozygous CDH1 241ins4 frameshift mutation. Detection of the same CDH1 241ins4
  mutation in archival tumour tissue of the corresponding primary ILBC proved the
  clonal origin of IPH-926 from this particular tumour. IPH-926 also lacked beta-catenin
  expression and showed aberrant cytoplasmic localization of p120-catenin. Array-CGH
  analysis of IPH-926 revealed a profile of genomic imbalances that included many
  distinct alterations previously observed in primary ILBCs. Spectral karyotyping
  of IPH-926 showed a hyperdiploid chromosome complement and numerous clonal, structural
  aberrations. IPH-926 cells were anti-cancer drug-resistant, clonogenic in soft agar,
  and tumourigenic in SCID mice. In xenograft tumours, IPH-926 cells recapitulated
  the linear cord invasion pattern that defines ILBCs. In summary, IPH-926 significantly
  extends the biological spectrum of the established breast cancer cell lines and
  will facilitate functional analyses of genuine human ILBC cells in vitro and in
  vivo.
