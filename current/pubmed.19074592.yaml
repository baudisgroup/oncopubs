abstract: Chromosome gains and losses used for risk stratification in chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL are commonly assessed by multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH studies. We designed and validated a customized array-comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH platform as a clinical assay for CLL genomic profiling. A 60-mer, 44,000-probe
  oligonucleotide array with a 50-kb average spatial resolution was augmented with
  high-density probe tiling at loci that are frequently aberrant in CLL. Aberrations
  identified by aCGH were compared with those identified by a FISH panel, including
  locus-specific probes to ATM 11q22.3 , the centromeric region of chromosome 12 12p11.1-q11
  , D13S319 13q14.3 , LAMP1 13q34 , and TP53 17p13.1 . In 100 CLL samples, aCGH FISH
  concordance was seen for 89 of FISH-called aberrations at the ATM n 18 , D13S319
  n 42 , LAMP n 12 , and TP53 n 22 loci and for chromosome 12 n 14 . Eighty-four percentage
  of FISH aCGH discordant calls were in samples either at or below the limit of aCGH
  sensitivity 10 to 25 FISH aberration-containing cells . Therefore, aCGH profiling
  is a feasible routine clinical test with comparable results to multiprobe FISH studies
  however, it may be less sensitive than FISH in cases with low-level aberrations.
  Further, a customized array design can provide comprehensive genomic profiling with
  additional accuracy in both identifying and defining the extent of small aberrations
  at target loci.
