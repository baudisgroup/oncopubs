abstract: Chromosomal translocations leading to deregulation of specific oncogenes
  characterize approximately 50 of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas DLBL .
  To characterize additional genetic features that may be of value in delineating
  the clinical characteristics of DLBL, we studied a panel of 96 cases at diagnosis
  consecutively ascertained at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center MSKCC for
  incidence of gene amplification, a genetic abnormality previously shown to be associated
  with tumor progression and clinical outcome. A subset of 20 cases was subjected
  to comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis, which identified nine sites of
  chromosomal amplification 1q21-23, 2p12-16, 8q24, 9q34, 12q12-14, 13q32, 16p12,
  18q21-22, and 22q12 . Candidate amplified genes mapped to these sites were selected
  for further analysis based on their known roles in lymphoid cell and lymphoma development,
  and or history of amplification in tumors. Probes for six genes, which fulfilled
  these criteria, REL 2p12-16 , MYC 8q24 , BCL2 18q21 , GLI, CDK4, and MDM2 12q13-14
  , were used in a quantitative Southern blotting analysis of the 96 DLBL DNAs. Each
  of these genes was amplified four or more copies with incidence ranging from 11
  to 23 . This analysis is consistent with our previous finding that REL amplification
  is associated with extranodal presentation. In addition, BCL2 rearrangement and
  or REL, MYC, BCL2, GLI, CDK4, and MDM2 amplification was associated with advanced
  stage disease. These data show, for the first time, that amplification of chromosomal
  regions and genes is a frequent phenomenon in DLBL and demonstrates their potential
  significance in lymphomagenesis.
