abstract: Genetic risk factors for sporadic neuroendocrine tumors NET are poorly understood.
  We tested risk associations in patients with sporadic NET and non-cancer controls,
  using a custom array containing 1536 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 355
  candidate genes. We identified 18 SNPs associated with NET risk at a P-value amp
  lt 0.01 in a discovery set of 261 cases and 319 controls. Two of these SNPs were
  found to be significantly associated with NET risk in an independent replication
  set of 235 cases and 113 controls, at a P value 0.05. An SNP in interleukin 12A
  IL12A rs2243123 , a gene implicated in inflammatory response, replicated with an
  adjusted odds ratio 95 confidence interval aOR 1.47 1.03, 2.11 P-trend 0.04. A second
  SNP in defender against cell death, DAD1 rs8005354 , a gene that modulates apoptosis,
  replicated at aOR 1.43 1.02, 2.02 P-trend 0.04. Consistent with our observations,
  a pathway analysis, performed in the discovery set, suggested that genetic variation
  in inflammatory pathways or apoptosis pathways is associated with NET risk. Our
  findings support further investigation of the potential role of IL12A and DAD1 in
  the etiology of NET.
