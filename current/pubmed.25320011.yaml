abstract: Bone is the most frequent site of metastasis in prostate cancer and patients
  with bone metastases are deemed incurable. Targeting prostate cancer cells that
  disseminated to the bone marrow before surgery and before metastatic outgrowth may
  therefore prevent lethal metastasis. This prompted us to directly analyze the transcriptome
  of disseminated cancer cells (DCC) isolated from patients with nonmetastatic (UICC
  stage M0) prostate cancer. We screened 105 bone marrow samples of patients with
  M0-stage prostate cancer and 18 bone marrow samples of patients without malignancy
  for the presence of EpCAM(+) single cells. In total, we isolated 270 cells from
  both groups by micromanipulation and globally amplified their mRNA. We used targeted
  transcriptional profiling to unambiguously identify DCCs for subsequent in-depth
  analysis. Transcriptomes of all cells were examined for the expression of EPCAM,
  KRT8, KRT18, KRT19, KRT14, KRT6a, KRT5, KLK3 (PSA), MAGEA2, MAGEA4, PTPRC (CD45),
  CD33, CD34, CD19, GYPC, SCL4A1 (band 3), and HBA2. Using these transcripts, we found
  it impossible to reliably identify true DCCs. We then applied combined genome and
  transcriptome analysis of single cells and found that EpCAM(+) cells from controls
  expressed transcripts thought to be epithelial-specific, whereas true DCCs may express
  hematopoietic transcripts. These results point to an unexpected transcriptome plasticity
  of epithelial cancer cells in bone marrow and question common transcriptional criteria
  to identify DCCs.  ï¿½2014 American Association for Cancer Research.
