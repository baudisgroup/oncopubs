abstract: Oral cancer develops and progresses by accumulation of genetic alterations.
  The interrelationship between these alterations and their sequence of occurrence
  in oral cancers has not been thoroughly understood. In the present study, we applied
  oncogenetic tree models to comparative genomic hybridization CGH data of 97 primary
  oral cancers to identify pathways of progression. CGH revealed the most frequent
  gains on chromosomes 8q 72.4 and 9q 41.2 and frequent losses on 3p 49.5 and 8p 47.5
  . Both mixture and distance-based tree models suggested multiple progression pathways
  and identified 8q as an early event. The mixture model suggested two independent
  pathways namely a major pathway with -8p and a less frequent pathway with 9q. The
  distance-based tree identified three progression pathways, one characterized by
  -8p, another by -3p and the third by alterations 11q and 7p. Differences were observed
  in cytogenetic pathways of node-positive and node-negative oral cancers. Node-positive
  cancers were characterized by more non-random aberrations n 11 and progressed via
  -8p or -3p. On the other hand, node-negative cancers involved fewer non-random alterations
  n 6 and progressed along -3p. In summary, the tree models for oral cancers provided
  novel information about the interactions between genetic alterations and predicted
  their probable order of occurrence.
