abstract: Prolonged culture of human embryonic stem cells hESCs can lead to adaptation
  and the acquisition of chromosomal abnormalities, underscoring the need for rigorous
  genetic analysis of these cells. Here we report the highest-resolution study of
  hESCs to date using an Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array containing 906,600 probes for single
  nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs and 946,000 probes for copy number variations CNVs
  . Analysis of 17 different hESC lines maintained in different laboratories identified
  843 CNVs of 50 kb-3 Mb in size. We identified, on average, 24 of the loss of heterozygosity
  LOH sites and 66 of the CNVs changed in culture between early and late passages
  of the same lines. Thirty percent of the genes detected within CNV sites had altered
  expression compared to samples with normal copy number states, of which amp gt 44
  were functionally linked to cancer. Furthermore, LOH of the q arm of chromosome
  16, which has not been observed previously in hESCs, was detected.
