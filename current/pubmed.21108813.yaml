abstract: Different cell subpopulations in a single tumor may show diverse capacities
  for growth, differentiation, metastasis formation, and sensitivity to treatments.
  Thus, heterogeneity is an important feature of tumors. However, due to limitations
  in experimental and analytical techniques, tumor heterogeneity has rarely been studied
  in detail.
