abstract: 'Biopsies of oropharyngeal cancer were screened for chromosomal imbalances
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH performed on 22 primary tumors and morphologically
  nonmalignant surrounding mucosa. The aim was to determine early chromosomal changes
  of tumor development and to draw conclusions on the mechanisms leading to multiple
  tumors. The most prominent chromosomal imbalances observed were over representations
  of genomic material on 3q, 15q, 8q, and 11q and losses on 9p, 3p, and 11q. In morphologically
  normal mucosa collected at 1 cm from the primary tumor border M1 , amplifications
  on 15q and 21q were most frequent. Far fewer gains and losses were found in M1 than
  in the primary tumor average 2.2 vs. 6.9 . Gains dominated over losses, but a tendency
  toward an increasing proportion of losses in the primary tumor PT was observed ratio
  of gains to losses: PT, 4.75 M1, 6.3 . Almost all the imbalances in M1 were detected
  in the primary tumor. No chromosomal alterations were identified with CGH in tissue
  samples dissected at 2 cm from the primary tumor M2 . In all samples, dysplastic
  morphologic changes decreased with distance from the primary tumor, which correlates
  with the observed lower level of genetic changes. We suggest that gains of genetic
  material on 15q and 21q are early events in malignant progression of squamous cell
  carcinoma, followed by gains on 3q, 8q, and 11q, and losses on 3p and 9p at later
  stages. Based on our cytogenetic data, we discuss the monoclonal model followed
  by lateral epithelial spread as an explanation of multiple head and neck squamous
  cell carcinomas.'
