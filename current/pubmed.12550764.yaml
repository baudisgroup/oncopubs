abstract: Rhabdomyosarcomas RMS are soft tissue sarcomas resembling developing skeletal
  muscle, and pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas PRMS are a rare nonpediatric entity. Little
  molecular cytogenetic information exists for PRMS, and their relationship to other
  subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma and other sarcomas is unclear. Chromosomal imbalances
  were determined in seven well-characterized cases of PRMS using comparative genomic
  hybridization. The smallest overlapping regions of gain were 1p22 approximately
  p33 71 , 7p 43 , 18 18q 43 , and 20 20p 43 , and the regions of loss were 10q23
  71 , 15q21 approximately q22 57 , 3p, 5q32 approximately qter, and 13 all 43 . Four
  of the seven cases had amplicons involving the regions 1p21 approximately p31, 1q21
  approximately q25, 3p12, 3q26 approximately qtel, 4q28 approximately q31, 8q21 approximately
  q23 8q, and 22q. These regions are distinct from those frequently associated with
  the alveolar subtype, whereas the embryonal subtype without anaplasia is rarely
  associated with amplification events other than gain amplification of 8q material.
  The regions of imbalance appeared more similar to those reported for malignant fibrous
  histiocytomas MFH and osteosarcomas, consistent with the suggestion that PRMS can
  be considered part of the spectrum of MFH. In addition, one of the cases classified
  as PRMS showed evidence for the presence of a PAX3-FOXO1A fusion gene, which is
  characteristic of the alveolar subtype of RMS.
