abstract: Little is known about genetic alterations during malignant progression of
  meningioma. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH in 20 patients 13 with
  typical, 4 with atypical and 3 with anaplastic meningiomas to investigate the genetic
  pathway underlying the development of meningioma. Typical meningiomas displayed
  only a few genetic changes such as monosomy 22. Anaplastic meningiomas manifested
  more aberrations than typical meningiomas, frequently exhibiting losses of 1p, 2p,
  6q, chromosome 10 and 14q, and gain of 20q, in addition to monosomy 22. The average
  number of alteration sites in each patient with typical meningioma was significantly
  less than those in each patient with atypical p amp lt 0.01 and with anaplastic
  meningioma p amp lt 0.05 . Anaplastic meningiomas showed the chromosomal changes
  seen in atypical meningiomas together with other aberrations. These CGH findings
  suggest that losses of 1p, 2p, 6q, chromosome 10 and 14q, and gain of 20q are genetic
  changes implicated in the malignant progression of meningioma.
