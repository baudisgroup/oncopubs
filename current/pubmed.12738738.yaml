abstract: The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer is largely determined by
  tumor stage. In this respect, colorectal cancers with lymph node metastases indicate
  a worse prognosis versus lymph node-negative tumors. Accordingly, there is considerable
  clinical interest in understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying metastasis
  formation. Furthermore, sensitive and specific biomarkers are needed to predict
  the metastatic phenotype at the time of diagnosis.
