abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to analyse 34 follicular
  lymphoma FL samples. 27 samples showed DNA sequence copy number changes of at least
  one genomic region 26 samples with at least one gain and nine with at least one
  loss . Some chromosomes or chromosomal regions were preferentially involved. The
  most frequently gained regions were chromosome 18q 29 of samples , chromosome X
  21 , chromosome 7 18 , chromosomes 2, 6p and 8q 12 . Two regions were preferentially
  lost: 6q 12 and 17p 9 . All these gained and lost regions have been previously reported
  in cytogenetic studies, confirming the accuracy of CGH in detecting genetic abnormalities
  in FL. 21 of samples displayed normal profiles, probably reflecting the absence
  of unbalanced abnormality, which is also in agreement with the cytogenetic data.
  In conclusion, we showed that CGH is an accurate, reliable and rapid method and
  we propose the inclusion of CGH in the evaluation of FL at diagnosis.'
