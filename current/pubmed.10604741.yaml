abstract: We analysed the involvement of known and putative tumour suppressor- and
  oncogene loci in ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS by microsatellite analysis LOH ,
  Southern blotting and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . A total of 78 pure
  DCIS cases, classified histologically as well, intermediately and poorly differentiated,
  were examined for LOH with 76 markers dispersed along all chromosome arms. LOH on
  chromosome 17 was more frequent in poorly differentiated DCIS 70 Compared to well-differentiated
  DCIS 17 , whereas loss on chromosome 16 was associated with well- and intermediately
  differentiated DCIS 66 . For a subset we have done Southern blot-and CGH analysis.
  C-erbB2 neu was amplified in 30 of poorly differentiated DCIS. No amplification
  was found of c-myc, mdm2, bek, flg and the epidermal growth factor EGF -receptor.
  By CGH, most frequent alterations in poorly differentiated DCIS were gains on 8q
  and 17q22-24 and deletion on 17p, whereas in well-differentiated DCIS amplification
  on chromosome 1q and deletion on 16q were found. In conclusion, our data indicates
  that inactivation of a yet unknown tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 16q is implicated
  in the development of most well and intermediately differentiated DCIS whereas amplification
  and inactivation of various genes on chromosome 17 are implicated in the development
  of poorly differentiated DCIS. Furthermore these data show that there is a genetic
  basis for the classification of DCIS in a well and poorly differentiated type and
  support the evidence of different genetic routes to develop a specific type of carcinoma
  in situ of the breast.
