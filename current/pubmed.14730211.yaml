abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors
  of the gastrointestinal tract. Current criteria for the diagnosis of malignant GISTs
  do not always reliably predict patient outcomes. In order to search for genetic
  markers with prognostic potential, chromosomal imbalance aberrations CIAs were analyzed
  in 28 subjects with GIST using comparative genomic hybridization and correlated
  with clinicopathological features. Except for a small rectal tumor, CIAs were identified
  in all GISTs, including 14 from the stomach, 11 from the small intestine, 1 from
  the esophagus, and 1 from the rectum. Losses were more common than gains. The median
  number of CIAs in high-risk GISTs was significantly higher than that in low-risk
  GISTs 5.60 - 2.59 vs. 3.38 - 2.55 p amp lt 0.05 , especially for losses 4.60 - 1.84
  vs. 2.63 - 2.13 p amp lt 0.01 . Loss of 14q was the most common CIA in both low-risk
  and high-risk GISTs, and can be regarded as an early event of GIST development.
  Losses of 1p and 15q were also very common, often coexisting, and were slightly
  more frequent in high-risk GISTs than in low-risk GISTs. Other recurrent CIAs, including
  losses of 10q, 13q, 15q, 18q, and 22q and gains of 5p, 12q, 17q, and 20q were relatively
  less common in this series. Among these CIAs, losses of 13q, 10q with minimal overlapping
  on q11-q22 , and 22q were most likely the chromosomal loci potentially harboring
  the tumor suppressor gene s which may be related to early recurrence and or metastasis
  during malignant transformation of GISTs.
