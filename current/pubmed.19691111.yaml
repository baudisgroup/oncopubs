abstract: To evaluate the mechanisms and consequences of chromosomal aberrations in
  colorectal cancer CRC , we used a combination of spectral karyotyping, array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH , and array-based global gene expression profiling on
  31 primary carcinomas and 15 established cell lines. Importantly, aCGH showed that
  the genomic profiles of primary tumors are recapitulated in the cell lines. We revealed
  a preponderance of chromosome breakpoints at sites of copy number variants CNVs
  in the CRC cell lines, a novel mechanism of DNA breakage in cancer. The integration
  of gene expression and aCGH led to the identification of 157 genes localized within
  high-level copy number changes whose transcriptional deregulation was significantly
  affected across all of the samples, thereby suggesting that these genes play a functional
  role in CRC. Genomic amplification at 8q24 was the most recurrent event and led
  to the overexpression of MYC and FAM84B. Copy number dependent gene expression resulted
  in deregulation of known cancer genes such as APC, FGFR2, and ERBB2. The identification
  of only 36 genes whose localization near a breakpoint could account for their observed
  deregulated expression demonstrates that the major mechanism for transcriptional
  deregulation in CRC is genomic copy number changes resulting from chromosomal aberrations.
