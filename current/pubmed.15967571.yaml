abstract: The completion of the human genome sequence and the development of high
  throughput technology present exciting opportunities for the study of cancer cells.
  High-resolution analysis of chromosomal aberrations provides a global framework
  for understanding complex patterns in cancer cells, allowing us to ask hypothesis-driven
  questions. Genome-wide analysis of amplification and deletion of genomic regions
  is a critical step to resolving the mechanisms of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. We
  used a high-resolution aCGH system that has over 4000 human BAC clones, resulting
  in an average coverage of 1Mb across the genome, to define whole genome copy number
  aberrations CNAs in a panel of human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. By combining
  the aCGH data with meticulous regional validation studies, we showed that array
  CGH could reliably detect known aberrations including single copy gain or loss,
  that data correlate well with standard techniques used for the detection of these
  genetic changes, and that this technique can be used to identify novel regions of
  genomic imbalance.
