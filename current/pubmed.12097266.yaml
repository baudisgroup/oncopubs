abstract: Genomic abnormalities at 348 loci encoding genes that may contribute to
  lung cancer transformation and progression were assessed using array comparative
  genomic hybridization in 21 squamous carcinomas SqCas and 16 adenocarcinomas AdCas
  . Hierarchical clustering showed a clear pattern of gains and losses for the SqCas,
  whereas the pattern for AdCas was less distinct. Cross-validated classification
  using a K-nearest-neighbor assigned, on average, 32 of 37 samples to their proper
  histological subtype. The most noticeable differences between SqCas and AdCas were
  gain of chromosome 3q22-q26 and loss of chromosome 3p. These occurred almost exclusively
  in SqCas. The region of recurrent increase is approximately 30 Mb in extent, ranging
  from EVI1 to TFRC. PIK3CA, the alpha catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  PI3K , is in this region. The PIK3CA copy number increase was validated using fluorescence
  in situ hybridization to lung cancer tissue microarrays. Activity of the downstream
  PI3K effector protein kinase B PKB was higher in SqCas than in AdCas and was correlated
  with PIK3CA copy number r 0.75 , suggesting that these copy number increases contribute
  to activation of PI3K signaling in SqCas of the lung.
