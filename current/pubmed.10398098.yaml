abstract: For a variety of technical reasons it is rarely possible to study cytogenetic
  abnormalities in ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS using traditional techniques. However,
  by combining molecular biology and computerized image analysis it is possible to
  carry out cytogenetic analyses on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, using
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The purpose of this study was to identify
  the prevalence of chromosomal amplifications and deletions in high-grade DCIS and
  to look specifically for unique or consistent abnormalities in this pre-invasive
  cancer. Twenty-three cases of asymptomatic, non-palpable, screen-detected, high-grade
  DCIS were examined using CGH on tumour cells obtained from histology slides. All
  cases showed chromosomal abnormalities. A wide variety of amplifications and deletions
  were spread across the genome. The most frequent changes were gains of chromosomes
  17 13 of 23 , 16p 13 of 23 , and 20q 9 of 23 and amplifications of 11q13 22 of 23
  , 12q 24.1-24.2 12 of 23 , 6p21.3 11 of 23 , and 1q31-qter 6 of 23 . The most frequent
  deletions were on 13q 21.3-q33 7 of 23 , 9p21 4 of 23 , and 6q16.1 4 of 23 . These
  findings indicate that high-grade DCIS is, from a cytogenetic viewpoint, an advanced
  lesion. There was no absolutely consistent finding in every case, but amplification
  of 11q13 was found in 22 of the 23 cases. The precise significance of this is unknown
  at present. This region of chromosome 11q harbours a number of known oncogenes,
  including cyclin D1 andINT2. It is likely that many of these findings are the result
  of accumulated chromosomal abnormalities, reflecting an unstable genome in established
  malignancy.
