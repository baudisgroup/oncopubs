abstract: The PI3K pathway is frequently activated in cancer; therefore, considerable
  effort is focused on identifying compounds that can inhibit specific pathway components,
  particularly the hallmark oncogene PIK3CA. Although targeted inhibition of a cancer
  survival gene holds significant promise, there are concerns that drug resistance
  may emerge within the cancerous cells, thus limiting clinical efficacy. Using genetically
  defined human mammary epithelial cells, we evolved resistance to the PI3K/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ235, and by genome-wide copy number analyses,
  we identified MYC and eIF4E amplification within the resistant cells. Importantly,
  either MYC or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) was required to
  bypass pharmacological PI3K/mTOR inhibition in resistant cells. Furthermore, these
  cells displayed elevated 5' cap-dependent protein translation. Collectively, these
  findings suggest that analysis of drivers of protein translation could facilitate
  the identification of cancer lesions that confer resistance to PI3K pathway-targeted
  drugs.
