abstract: Two developmentally highly divergent nonmelanoma skin cancers, the epidermal
  squamous cell carcinomas SCC and the neuroendocrine Merkel cell carcinomas MCC ,
  occur late in life at sun-exposed body sites. To determine whether these similarities
  may indicate common genetic alterations, we studied the genetic profile of 10 MCCs
  and analyzed 6 derived cell lines and 5 skin SCC lines by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and molecular genetic analyses. Although the MCCs were highly divergent-only
  3 of the 10 tumors exhibited common gains and losses-they shared gain of 8q21-q22
  and loss of 4p15-pter with the genetically much more homogeneous SCC lines. In addition,
  2 of 5 SCC and 2 of 6 MCC lines exhibited UV-B-type-specific mutations in the p53
  tumor-suppressor gene and a high frequency 9 11 of CC-- amp gt TT double base changes
  in codon 27 of the Harvey Ha -ras gene. Since 45 of the tumor lines were homozygous
  for this nucleotide substitution compared to 14 of the controls and in 1 MCC patient
  the wild-type allele was lost in the tumor, this novel polymorphism may contribute
  to tumor development. On the other hand, loss of 3p, characteristic for SCCs, was
  rare in MCCs. Although in 2 of 3 SCC lines 3p loss was correlated with reduced expression
  of the FHIT fragile histidine triad gene, the potential tumor suppressor mapped
  to 3p14.2 and 2 MCC lines with normal 3p showed aberrant or no FHIT transcripts.
  Taken together, in addition to the common UV-B-specific mutations in the p53 and
  Ha-ras gene, MCCs and SCCs also share chromosomal imbalances that may point to a
  common environmental-derived e.g., UV-A oxidative damage.
