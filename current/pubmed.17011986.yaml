abstract: 'Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of death among Mexican women
  amp gt 35 years of age. At the molecular level, changes in many genetic pathways
  have been reported to be associated with this neoplasm. To analyze these changes,
  we determined gene expression profiles and chromosomal structural alterations in
  tumors from Mexican women. We obtained mRNA to identify expression profiles with
  microarray technology, and DNA to determine amplifications and deletions, in 10
  fresh sporadic breast tumor biopsies without treatment, as well as in 10 nonaffected
  breast tissues. Expression profiles were compared with genetic changes observed
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We compared the expression profiles against
  the structural alterations from the studied genes by means of microarrays at least
  17 of these genes correlated with DNA copy number alterations. We found that the
  following genes were overexpressed: LAMC1, PCTK3, CCNC, CCND1, FGF3, PCTK2, L1CAM,
  BGN, and PLXNB3 alias PLEXR . Underexpressed genes included CASP9, FGR, TP73, HSPG2,
  and ERCC1 genes turned off included FRAP1, EPHA2 previously ECK , IL12A, E2F5, TNFRSF10B,
  TNFRSF10A, EFNB3, and BCL2. The results will allow us, in the near future, to outline
  genes that could serve as diagnostic, prognostic, or target therapy markers for
  the Mexican population.'
