abstract: Although considerable knowledge exists on the tumor biology of lung cancer,
  there is still a need to assess molecular events for the clinical management of
  the disease. We studied the pattern of chromosomal imbalances in 45 non-small cell
  lung carcinomas NSCLC by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and correlated the
  results with clinicopathological features including immunohistochemical IHC expression
  of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR . Twenty-one tumors were squamous cell
  carcinomas SCC and 24 non-squamous cell lung carcinomas NSCC comprising 9 adenocarcinomas
  ADC , 9 large cell carcinomas LCC , 4 sarcomatoid carcinomas and 2 adenosquamous
  carcinomas. The mean number of individual imbalances was 7.1 for SCC mean gains,
  3.8 mean losses, 3.4 and 6.4 for NSCC mean gains, 4.5 mean losses, 1.9 . Several
  individual imbalances correlated significantly with increasing number of imbalances,
  that were 1q, -3p, 3q, -5q, -8p, 8q, 7p, 12p, and 14q. Altogether, the most frequent
  imbalances were 3q 49 , 5p 49 , -5q 36 , 8q 29 , -8p 24 , -3p 22 , 7p 22 , 12p 22
  , 14q 20 , 18p 20 , 1q 18 , and 7q 18 . Among these, 3q and 18p correlated significantly
  with SCC, and 5p and 14q with NSCC. Remarkably, overlapping imbalances included
  3q26, 7p11 in SCC and 1q21, 3q24, 12p11, and 14q12 in NSCC. EGFR expression was
  higher in SCC than in NSCC and correlated with 3q in the entire series. In addition,
  12p correlated significantly with disease progress with the exception of nodal involvement
  in NSCC as well as with disease progress, regardless of nodal involvement, in the
  entire series. In conclusion, the present study contributes to the molecular biological
  characterization of NSCLC histological subtypes and through evaluation of molecular
  events to the recently emergent focus on novel markers for lung cancer treatment.
