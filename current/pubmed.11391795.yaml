abstract: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia T-PLL is a rare malignant proliferation of
  lymphoid cells with a postthymic phenotype. Previous cytogenetic and molecular studies
  reported complex karyotypes with recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, including
  translocations involving either TCL1 at 14q32.1 or MTCP1 at Xq28, inactivation of
  the ATM gene by deletion and or mutation, and isochromosomes 8. For extensive study
  of chromosomal imbalances in T-PLL, we analyzed 22 tumoral DNAs using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . Abnormal CGH profiles were detected in all cases, demonstrating
  highly recurrent gains and losses and largely extending the abnormalities previously
  established. Only a few nonrecurrent abnormalities were observed, in contrast to
  the genetic instability anticipated from ATM inactivation. Nine recurrent regions
  of loss were identified at 8p frequency 86 , 11q 68 , 22q11 45 , 13q 41 , 6q 36
  , 9p 27 , 12p 23 , 11p11-p14 23 , and 17p 23 , as well as four regions of gain at
  8q 82 , 14q32 50 , 22q21-qter 41 , and 6p 23 . Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities
  were simultaneously present in each case mean, 5.7 up to 10 , none being mutually
  exclusive of another. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed and
  extended 22q11 and 13q losses, giving final frequencies of 55 and 45 , respectively.
  Analysis of one case over a 7-year period confirmed the overall genetic stability
  of T-PLL and showed that tumor progression was associated with the onset of a few
  chromosomal abnormalities. This study establishes a complex pattern of highly recurrent
  chromosomal abnormalities in T-PLL, including some, such as chromosome 13 deletion,
  commonly found in other lymphoid malignancies.
