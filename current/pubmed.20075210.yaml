abstract: Specific chromosomal alterations are recognized as important prognostic
  factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . Array-based karyotyping is gaining
  acceptance as an alternative to the standard fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH panel for detecting these aberrations. This study explores the optimum single
  nucleotide polymorphism SNP array probe density for routine clinical use, presents
  clinical validation results for the 250K Nsp Affymetrix SNP array, and highlights
  clinically actionable genetic lesions missed by FISH and conventional cytogenetics.
  CLL samples were processed on low 10K2.0 , medium 250K Nsp , and high SNP6.0 probe
  density Affymetrix SNP arrays. Break point definition and detection rates for clinically
  relevant genetic lesions were compared. The 250K Nsp array was subsequently validated
  for routine clinical use and demonstrated 98.5 concordance with the standard CLL
  FISH panel. SNP array karyotyping detected genomic complexity and or acquired uniparental
  disomy not detected by the FISH panel. In particular, a region of acquired uniparental
  disomy on 17p was shown to harbor two mutated copies of TP53 that would have gone
  undetected by FISH, conventional cytogenetics, or array comparative genomic hybridization.
  SNP array karyotyping allows genome-wide, high resolution detection of copy number
  and uniparental disomy at genomic regions with established prognostic significance
  in CLL, detects lesions missed by FISH, and provides insight into gene dosage at
  these loci.
