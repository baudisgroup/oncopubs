abstract: The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.
  About 2 to 4 of breast cancer patients with positive family history, negative for
  point mutations, can be expected to carry large rearrangements in one of these two
  genes. We developed a novel diagnostic genetic test for the physical mapping of
  large rearrangements, based on molecular combing MC , a FISH-based technique for
  direct visualization of single DNA molecules at high resolution. We designed specific
  Genomic Morse Codes GMCs , covering the exons, the noncoding regions, and large
  genomic portions flanking both genes. We validated our approach by testing 10 index
  cases with positive family history of breast cancer and 50 negative controls. Large
  rearrangements, corresponding to deletions and duplications with sizes ranging from
  3 to 40 kb, were detected and characterized on both genes, including four novel
  mutations. The nature of all the identified mutations was confirmed by high-resolution
  array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and breakpoints characterized by sequencing.
  The developed GMCs allowed to localize several tandem repeat duplications on both
  genes. We propose the developed genetic test as a valuable tool to screen large
  rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 to be combined in clinical settings with an assay
  capable of detecting small mutations.
