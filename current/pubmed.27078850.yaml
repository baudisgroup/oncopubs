abstract: Urachal adenocarcinoma is a rare bladder malignancy arising from the urachal
  remnant. Given its rarity and the lack of knowledge about its genetic characteristics,
  optimal management of this cancer is not well defined. Practice patterns vary and
  outcomes remain poor. In order to identify the genomic underpinnings of this malignancy,
  we performed whole exome sequencing using seven tumor/normal pairs of formalin fixed
  archival specimens. We identified recurrent evidence of MAP-kinase pathway activation
  as three patients had neurofibromin 1 (NF1) mutations, with one of these patients
  also harboring an oncogenic KRAS G13D mutation. We also observed recurrent evidence
  of Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activation as three patients had oncogenic mutations in
  APC or RNF43. In addition, somatic copy number analysis revealed focal chromosome
  12p amplifications in three samples, resembling findings from testicular germ cell
  tumors. We describe the genomic landscape of this malignancy in our institutional
  cohort and propose investigation of the therapeutic potential for MAP-K pathway
  inhibition in the subset of patients who show evidence of its activation.
