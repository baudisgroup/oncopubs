abstract: We studied DNA copy number changes in gastric cancer GC using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH analysis on 35 resected gastric carcinomas 22 of the intestinal
  type and 13 of the diffuse type . Eighty-three percent of the cases showed DNA copy
  number changes. Gains were more common than losses median of 3 and 1 in primary
  tumors of the intestinal and diffuse type, respectively . The most common gains
  were detected on 20q 46 12 intestinal type 55 and four diffuse type 31 , 8q 37 10
  intestinal type 45 and three diffuse type 23 , and 17q12-21 29 all but one intestinal
  type 41 . The most frequent losses were detected on 18q 26 all intestinal type 41
  and on 4q 23 all intestinal type 32 . High-level amplifications were observed in
  the intestinal type of tumors at 17q12-21 three tumors , 20q three tumors . 2q one
  tumor , and 18q one tumor . In the diffuse type, high-level amplification was detected
  once at 13q.
