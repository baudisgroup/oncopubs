abstract: 'The incidence of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome t-MDS in pediatric
  patients is increasing in parallel with the more successful management of the primary
  tumor, but scant information is available on clinical and cytogenetic characteristics.
  We report here two children affected by t-MDS after chemo radiotherapy for a primary
  solid tumor, both with an unbalanced translocation 1 6 in their bone marrow. Characterization
  by array comparative genomic hybridization of the imbalances showed an almost identical
  pattern: almost complete trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 1, and a terminal
  deletion and interstitial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 6. The gain
  of chromosome 6 short arm encompasses regions already highlighted as possibly relevant
  for t-MDS in adults, and we suggest that the unbalanced translocation reported here
  be considered a new recurrent, non-random chromosomal abnormality in pediatric patients
  with t-MDS.'
