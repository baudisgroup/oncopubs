abstract: Blue nevi are benign dermal melanocytic proliferations that can sometimes
  share overlapping microscopic features with melanoma. We used comparative genomic
  hybridization to analyze three groups of dermal melanocytic proliferations. Group
  1 consisted of 10 cellular blue nevi and 1 deep penetrating nevus, none of which
  showed chromosomal aberrations. Group 2 consisted of 11 lesions that were histopathologically
  ambiguous. Three of these lesions demonstrated chromosomal aberrations three or
  fewer per lesion . Group 3 consisted of seven histopathologically malignant lesions,
  each showing three or more chromosomal aberrations. Moderate to severe cytologic
  atypia and a mitotic rate of three or more mitoses per 10 high power fields were
  present in six of eight 75 lesions that had at least three chromosomal aberrations
  but were absent in 15 of 20 75 lesions without chromosomal aberrations. Necrosis
  was present in four of the 29 13 lesions, with every lesion with necrosis demonstrating
  three or more genomic abnormalities. In conclusion, histopathologically unequivocally
  benign or malignant dermal melanocytic proliferations show nonoverlapping patterns
  of chromosomal aberrations. Ambiguous lesions can be separated into lesions with
  and without chromosomal aberrations. Future studies with clinical follow-up are
  necessary to determine which aberrations are most informative for classification
  of these lesions.
