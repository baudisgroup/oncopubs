abstract: 'Nodal marginal zone lymphoma is a poorly defined entity in the World Health
  Organization classification, based largely on criteria of exclusion and the diagnosis
  often remains subjective. Follicular lymphoma lacking t(14;18) has similar characteristics
  which results in a major potential diagnostic overlap which this study aims to dissect.
  Four subgroups of lymphoma samples (n=56) were analyzed with high-resolution array
  comparative genome hybridization: nodal marginal zone lymphoma, t(14;18)-negative
  follicular lymphoma, localized t(14:18)-positive follicular lymphoma and disseminated
  t(14;18)-positive follicular lymphoma. Gains on chromosomes 7, 8 and 12 were observed
  in all subgroups. The mean number of aberrations was higher in disseminated t(14;18)-positive
  follicular lymphoma than in localized t(14:18)-positive follicular lymphoma (P<0.01)
  and the majority of alterations in localized t(14:18)-positive follicular lymphoma
  were also found in disseminated t(14;18)-positive follicular lymphoma. Nodal marginal
  zone lymphoma was marked by 3q gains with amplifications of four genes. A different
  overall pattern of aberrations was seen in t(14;18)-negative follicular lymphoma
  compared to t(14;18)-positive follicular lymphoma. t(14;18)-negative follicular
  lymphoma is characterized by specific (focal) gains on chromosome 3, as observed
  in nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Our results support the notion that localized t(14:18)-positive
  follicular lymphoma represents an early phase of disseminated t(14;18)-positive
  follicular lymphoma. t(14;18)-negative follicular lymphoma bears aberrations that
  are more like those in nodal marginal zone lymphoma, suggesting a relation between
  these groups.'
