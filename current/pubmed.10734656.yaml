abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to clarify the chromosomal
  status of 15 patients diagnosed with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL
  . Bone marrow samples from 10 of the 15 patients were selected because no metaphases
  were obtained for cytogenetic analysis. Three patients with normal trypsin and giemsa
  banding GTG karyotypes were also studied by CGH to determine whether significant
  abnormalities might have been missed by banding analysis, and samples from an additional
  2 patients with hyperdiploidy were also included. Seven of the 10 patients with
  failed GTG banding analysis were found to be chromosomally abnormal by CGH 2 out
  of 3 patients with normal GTG band karyotypes were abnormal, indicating that the
  metaphases available for karyotyping were not malignant cells, and that CGH analysis
  of hyperdiploid samples provided more accurate resolution than karyotyping alone.
  The prognostic value of chromosomal aberrations detected by CGII and the efficiency
  of the technique suggest a central role for CGH in routine clinical cytogenetics.
