abstract: Ulcerative colitis UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon associated
  with a high risk of colorectal cancer. This increased cancer risk is thought to
  result from the cellular damage induced by the inflammatory field. The aim of this
  study was to determine the pattern and time course of genomic instability occurring
  in UC-related neoplasia. Sites of cancer, dysplasia, and nondysplasia from 14 UC
  colectomy cases containing cancer were analyzed for chromosomal alterations by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and for microsatellite instability using a series of 10
  microsatellite markers. Clonal chromosomal alterations were present in 85 of cancer
  sites, 86 of dysplasia sites, and 36 of nondysplasia sites. Losses of chromosome
  18 or 18q and chromosome 5 or 5q were common in cancer and dysplasia and were occasionally
  detected in nondysplasia. High-level microsatellite instability was detected in
  the cancer and dysplasia of two cases. Samples that demonstrated high-level microsatellite
  instability were unlikely to have chromosomal alterations demonstrable by CGH. These
  studies suggest that the predominant type of genomic instability in UC-related neoplasia
  is associated with chromosomal alterations and that this type of genomic instability
  frequently occurs before the development of histologically defined dysplasia.
