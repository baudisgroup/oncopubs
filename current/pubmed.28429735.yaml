abstract: Several studies using genome-wide molecular techniques have reported various
  degrees of genetic heterogeneity between primary tumours and their distant metastases.
  However, it has been difficult to discern patterns of dissemination owing to the
  limited number of patients and available metastases. Here, we use phylogenetic techniques
  on data generated using whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of primary
  and multiple-matched metastatic tumours from ten autopsied patients to infer the
  evolutionary history of breast cancer progression. We observed two modes of disease
  progression. In some patients, all distant metastases cluster on a branch separate
  from their primary lesion. Clonal frequency analyses of somatic mutations show that
  the metastases have a monoclonal origin and descend from a common 'metastatic precursor'.
  Alternatively, multiple metastatic lesions are seeded from different clones present
  within the primary tumour. We further show that a metastasis can be horizontally
  cross-seeded. These findings provide insights into breast cancer dissemination.
