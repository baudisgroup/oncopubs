abstract: 'Various chromosome 11 alterations have been described in rhabdomyosarcoma
  RMS . Allelic losses of 11p15.5 are characteristic of embryonal RMS eRMS , whereas
  an increase in the expression of the Igf2 gene located on 11p15.5 has regularly
  been observed in eRMS and alveolar RMS aRMS . The aim of our study was to analyse
  chromosome 11 alterations of RMS by combining different molecular-genetic and cytogenetic
  methods. 16 RMSs 7 aRMS with proven 2 13 or 1 13 translocations, 9 eRMS were studied
  by a PCR-based microsatellite analysis of loci 11p15.5 and 11q23. Comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH was performed in 8 16 cases. The ploidy status of chromosome 11
  was evaluated using the FISH technique. A RT-PCR analysis of Igf2 gene region was
  performed to evaluate the imprinting status. Allelic losses LOH of 11p15.5 were
  observed in 4 7 aRMS and 8 9 eRMS. These losses were accompanied by LOH of 11q23
  in 2 7 aRMS and 5 9 eRMS, respectively. CGH of all the eRMSs and one aRMS studied
  revealed gains of genetic material mostly involving the entire length of chromosome
  11. One aRMS showed a loss of chromosome 11 material, both in CGH and LOH analysis.
  In 2 9 aRMS, which neither in CGH nor in LOH analysis had exhibited chromosome 11
  alterations, biallelic IGF-II expression was revealed. Our results show that chromosome
  11 alterations play a major role in the biology of both alveolar and eRMS. Combining
  the data of our study, we demonstrated that three different chromosome 11 alterations
  are involved in the tumorigenesis of RMS: 1 LOH resulting in hemizygosity of chromosome
  11. 2 LOH with simultaneous gains of chromosome 11 material due to uniparental polysomy.
  3 loss of imprinting for the Igf2 gene in the absence of gross chromosome 11 alterations.'
