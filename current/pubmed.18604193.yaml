abstract: Myoepithelioma, mixed tumor and parachordoma are uncommon soft tissue tumors
  thought to represent morphological variants of a single tumor type. The genetic
  basis of these neoplasms is poorly understood. However, they morphologically resemble
  mixed tumor of the salivary glands also known as pleomorphic adenoma , a tumor characterized
  by deregulated expression of PLAG1 or HMGA2. To evaluate a possible genetic relationship
  between these soft tissue and salivary gland tumors, PLAG1 expression levels and
  the genomic status of PLAG1 and HMGA2 were investigated in five soft tissue myoepitheliomas
  and one pleomorphic adenoma. In addition, all tumors were cytogenetically investigated
  and whole genome DNA copy number imbalances were studied in five of them. The genetic
  profiles were heterogeneous and the only aberration common to all soft tissue myoepitheliomas
  was a minimally deleted region of 3.55 Mb in chromosome band 19p13. Recurrent deletion
  of CDKN2A suggests that inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene is pathogenetically
  important in a subset. Furthermore, PLAG1 rearrangement was found in a soft tissue
  tumor from a patient previously treated for a salivary pleomorphic adenoma, indicating
  either metastasis of the salivary gland lesion or that some soft tissue tumors develop
  through the same mechanisms as their salivary gland counterparts.
