abstract: A combination of molecular cytogenetic and expression array analysis has
  been performed on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC of the oral cavity
  and supraglottis. These studies were performed to identify consensus regions of
  chromosomal imbalance and structural rearrangement to determine whether genes located
  in these genomic regions are subject to alterations in gene expression. Such combinatorial
  studies may help to identify recurrent patterns of altered gene expression in the
  context of specific chromosomal changes.
