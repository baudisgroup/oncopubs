abstract: Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma SCC sometimes causes lymph node metastasis
  and results in poor prognosis. However, little is known about cytogenetic alterations
  underlying tumor progression or metastasis. The aim of the present study was to
  investigate the genetic aberrations and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
  EGFR in metastatic SCC of the skin.
