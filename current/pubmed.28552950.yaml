abstract: Meningiomas, derived from arachnoid cap cells, are the most common intracranial
  tumor. High-grade meningiomas, as well as those located at the skull base or near
  venous sinuses, frequently recur and are challenging to manage. Next-generation
  sequencing is identifying novel pharmacologic targets in meningiomas to complement
  surgery and radiation. However, due to the lack of in vitro models, the importance
  and implications of these genetic variants in meningioma pathogenesis and therapy
  remain unclear. We performed whole exome sequencing to assess single nucleotide
  variants and somatic copy number variants in four human meningioma cell lines, including
  two benign lines (HBL-52 and Ben-Men-1) and two malignant lines (IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN).
  The two malignant cell lines harbored an elevated rate of mutations and copy number
  alterations compared to the benign lines, consistent with the genetic profiles of
  high-grade meningiomas. In addition, these cell lines also harbored known meningioma
  driver mutations in neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and TNF receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7).
  These findings demonstrate the relevance of meningioma cell lines as a model system,
  especially as tools to investigate the signaling pathways of, and subsequent resistance
  to, therapeutics currently in clinical trials.
