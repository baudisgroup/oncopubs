abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used for the examination of ten
  cases of myeloid leukemia eight acute myeloid leukemias and two myelodysplastic
  syndromes . In five cases, genomic gains or losses were identified, which mapped
  to chromosomal regions known to be involved in this group of malignancies. In comparison
  to the results obtained by banding analysis, discrepancies were found in three of
  the ten cases in two cases, chromosomal imbalances were not identified by CGH because
  they were present only in small subclones. In the other case, there were no evaluable
  metaphase cells for banding analysis CGH revealed an overrepresentation of chromosome
  8, which was confirmed by interphase cytogenetics with a chromosome 8-specific alphoid
  probe. All abnormalities revealed by CGH were confirmed by G-banding or subsequent
  interphase cytogenetic analysis, which demonstrates the high specificity of the
  method. Furthermore, in all cases, CGH identified the chromosomal imbalances present
  in the major clone as detected by banding analysis. The good correlation between
  CGH and chromosome banding results in myeloid leukemias makes this tumor a good
  model for the assessment of tools that are developed for automated and quantitative
  CGH analysis.
