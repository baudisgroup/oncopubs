abstract: Neurofibromatosis type 1 von Recklinghausens NF1 is an autosomal dominant
  disease associated with an increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasia including
  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNSTs . In this study, we employed comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to determine changes in the relative chromosome copy number
  in 24 patients with neurofibromas, including 12 NF1-associated and 12 sporadic cases.
  Differences in the frequency and distribution of chromosomal imbalances were observed
  in both NF1-asociated and sporadic neurofibromas. Chromosomal imbalances were more
  common in NF1-associated tumors than in sporadic neurofibromas. In both groups,
  the number of losses was higher than the number of gains, suggesting a predominant
  role of tumor suppressor gene in tumorigenesis. A number of new chromosomal imbalances
  were noted including chromosomes 17, 19, and chromosome arm 22q, which may be related
  to oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in neurofibromas. In NF1-associated neurofibromas,
  the most frequent losses were found in chromosome 17 the minimal common regions
  were 17p11.2-- amp gt p13 in nine cases and 17q24-- amp gt q25 in six cases and
  19p 19p13.2 in nine cases . In addition, both NF1-associated and sporadic neurofibromas
  often exhibited losses at chromosome arms 19q and 22q in NF1 tumors, the minimal
  common regions were 19q13.2-- amp gt qter in seven cases .
