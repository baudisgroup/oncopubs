abstract: Pediatric undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas USTS are a rare group of
  neoplasms that are unclassifiable despite the application of immunohistochemical,
  cytogenetic, and molecular techniques. To date, there is a dearth of studies looking
  at the cytogenetic and molecular genetic alterations in such tumors. Trisomy 8,
  a frequent molecular alteration in neoplasia, is seen in several soft tissue sarcomas,
  including Ewing sarcoma primitive neuroectodermal tumor ES PNET , synovial sarcoma,
  and leiomyosarcoma. Because USTS share several clinicobiological features with the
  aforementioned tumors, the occurrence of alterations in chromosome 8 was studied
  in 11 pediatric USTS using a combination of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH , spectral karyotyping SKY , and genomic profiling with oligonucleotide array
  comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . The copy number status of MYC was also
  assessed on the same tumors using dual-color FISH, with the aim of delineating the
  degree and intratumoral distribution of MYC amplification in this tumor. A near-uniform
  presence of an increase in MYC copy number was observed, along with an increase
  in chromosome 8 copy number in all the tumors. SKY and aCGH analysis of tumors exhibiting
  trisomy 8 confirmed the numerical imbalances. The occurrence of trisomy 8 in a subset
  of pediatric USTS confirms a shared genomic alteration with several other soft tissue
  sarcomas. Further studies are required to determine the clinical implications of
  such a finding.
