abstract: A substantial number of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer relapse
  from metastatic disease. Identification of these patients by genetic profiling of
  their primary tumours may allow more informed follow-up and tailored administration
  of adjuvant therapy. Primary tumours from 70 patients with early-stage and largely
  microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer were profiled using metaphase-based comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and the aberrations confirmed independently in a subset
  of patients using microarray-based CGH. Of the 70 cancers, 61 were amenable to CGH,
  and follow-up data was available from 56 patients. Genomic aberrations were correlated
  with patients survival using univariate, multivariate and Kaplan-Meier survival
  curves. Metastatic primary tumours exhibited more complex genomic aberrations than
  non-metastatic primary tumours. Loss of chromosome 4p was an independent prognostic
  factor in early-stage colorectal cancer using multivariate analysis Hazard ratio,
  9.6 95 CI, 3.3-28 P 0.0001 . Loss of both chromosome arms 8p and 18q had a statistically
  significant negative effect on disease-free survival. Moreover, primary tumours
  with loss of both chromosomes 4 and 14q bestowed poorer prognosis than tumours with
  loss of any one of the two chromosomes P amp lt 0.0001 . Genetic profiling of primary
  tumours of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer is of significant value in
  identifying the subset of patients who may relapse with metastatic disease. Accordingly,
  the molecular genetic features of primary tumours should be considered in the mainstream
  management of patients with this specific stage of the disease.
