abstract: To clarify the genetic aberrations involved in the development and progression
  of hepatitis C virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma HCV-HCC , we investigated
  DNA copy number aberrations DCNAs in 19 surgically resected HCCs by conventional
  CGH and array CGH. Conventional CGH revealed that increases of DNA copy number were
  frequent at 1q 79 of the cases , 8q 37 , 6p 32 , and 10p 32 and that decreases were
  frequent at 17p 79 , 16q 58 , 4q 53 , 13q 42 , 10q 37 , 1p 32 , and 8p 32 . In general,
  genes that showed DCNAs by array CGH were usually located in chromosomal regions
  with DCNAs detected by conventional CGH analysis. Increases in copy numbers of the
  LAMC2, TGFB2, and AKT3 genes located on 1q and decreases in copy numbers of FGR
  SRC2 and CYLD located on 1p and 16q, respectively were observed in more than 30
  of tumors, including small, well-differentiated carcinomas. These findings suggest
  that these genes are associated with the development of HCV-HCC. Increases of MOS,
  MYC, EXT1, and PTK2 located on 8q were detected exclusively in moderately and poorly
  differentiated tumors, suggesting that these alterations contribute to tumor progression.
  In conclusion, chromosomal and array CGH technologies allow identification of genes
  involved in the development and progression of HCV-HCC.
