abstract: Astrocytoma is comprised of a group of common intracranial neoplasms that
  are classified into four grades based on the World Health Organization histological
  criteria and patient survival. To date, histological grade, patient age, and clinical
  performance, as reflected in the Karnofsky score, are the most reliable prognostic
  predictors. Recently, there has been a significant effort to identify additional
  prognostic markers using objective molecular genetic techniques. We believe that
  the identification of such markers will characterize new chromosomal loci important
  in astrocytoma progression and aid clinical diagnosis and prognosis. To this end,
  our laboratory used comparative genomic hybridization to identify DNA sequence copy
  number changes in 102 astrocytomas. Novel losses of 19p loci were detected in low-grade
  pilocytic astrocytomas and losses of loci on 9p, 10, and 22 along with gains on
  7, 19, and 20 were detected in a significant proportion of high-grade astrocytomas.
  The Cox proportional hazards statistical modeling showed that the presence of 7q
  and -10q comparative genomic hybridization alterations significantly increased a
  patients risk of dying, independent of histological grade. This investigation demonstrates
  the efficacy of comparative genomic hybridization for identifying tumor suppressor
  and oncogene loci in different astrocytic grades. The cumulative effect of these
  loci is an important consideration in their diagnostic and prognostic implications.
