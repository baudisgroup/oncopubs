abstract: Comprehensive information about the molecular cytogenetic changes in metastases
  of colorectal cancer is not yet available. To define such changes in metastases,
  we measured relative DNA sequence copy numbers by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Samples from 27 liver metastases and 6 synchronous primary tumors were analyzed.
  An average of 9.9 aberrations per tumor was found in the metastases. Gains of chromosome
  arms 20q 85 , 13q 48 , 7p 44 , and 8q 44 and losses of chromosome arms 18q 89 ,
  8p 59 , 1p 56 , and 18p 48 were detected most frequently. Chromosomes 14 and 15
  were lost in 26 and 30 of the metastases, respectively. No consistent differences
  were observed between primary tumors and synchronous metastases. Fluorescence in
  situ hybridization FISH was used for further characterization of gains of chromosome
  arm 20q. Touch preparations of 13 tumors that had demonstrated 20q gain with CGH
  were examined with FISH by use of a set of probes mapping to different parts of
  20q. A probe for 20p was used as a reference. FISH showed relative gain of at least
  one 20q locus in 12 of the tumors. High-level gains were detected in 38 of the tumors,
  preferentially for probes mapping to band 20q13. Our CGH data indicate that colorectal
  metastases show chromosomal changes similar to those that have been reported for
  primary tumors. Chromosomal losses were seen at higher frequency, particularly for
  chromosomes 14 and 15. By FISH, we identified subregions on chromosome arm 20q that
  are frequently involved in DNA amplifications in colorectal cancer and that may
  harbor candidate proto-oncogenes.
