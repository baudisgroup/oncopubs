abstract: Benign metastasizing leiomyoma is a rare lesion characterized by benign-appearing
  smooth muscle tumor most frequently involving the lung and usually associated with
  a benign leiomyoma or intravenous leiomyomatosis of the uterus. The pathogenetic
  mechanism of the tumor has not been clarified, but the possibilities including hormone-sensitive
  in situ proliferations of smooth muscle bundles, mechanical displacement or intravascular
  spread of preexisting benign uterine tumor tissue, and metastasized very low-grade
  uterine leiomyosarcoma have been proposed. We described a case of pulmonary benign
  metastasizing leiomyoma associated with a uterine intravenous leiomyomatosis in
  a 46-year-old woman with a result of comparative genomic hybridization study. The
  2 lesions showed significantly overlapping, if not identical, complex genomic changes
  in the comparative genomic hybridization, suggesting that the 2 lesions are closely
  related to each other. Unresected pulmonary nodules were left untreated for 13 months
  after the hysterectomy and wedge biopsy of 3 pulmonary nodules to show no further
  growth, suggesting clinical behavior of nonmalignant tumor in our case. Benign metastasizing
  leiomyomas may comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors in terms of their malignant
  potential and pathogenetic mechanism.
