abstract: Leiomyosarcomas comprise a group of malignant soft-tissue tumors with smooth-muscle
  differentiation. In this study, 14 cases of leiomyosarcoma were screened for changes
  in relative chromosome copy number by comparative genomic hybridization. A high
  number of imbalances mean, 16.3 range, 6-26 was detected, with chromosomal gains
  occurring about twice as much as losses. The most frequent gains were found in 5p15,
  8q24, 15q25-- amp gt q26, 17p, and Xp 43 to 50 , whereas the most frequent losses
  were found in 10q and 13q 50 and 78 , respectively . Twenty high-level amplifications
  affecting 15 different chromosomal subregions were detected in nine different tumors.
  In three leiomyosarcomas, sequences on chromosome arm 17p were found to be highly
  amplified, with a minimal overlapping region on subbands 17p12-- amp gt p11. We
  further discovered that the Smith-Magenis syndrome critical region on 17p11.2 is
  included in the 17p amplicons of two leiomyosarcoma cases. Using probes flanking
  this genetically unstable region, a mean of 14 and 22 signals per nucleus, respectively,
  was detected in both leiomyosarcomas by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In conclusion,
  this analysis identifies a number of characteristic chromosomal imbalances in leiomyosarcomas
  and provides evidence for the localization of potential oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes active in leiomyosarcoma genomes.
