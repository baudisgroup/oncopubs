abstract: Lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS of the breast is considered a marker for
  an increased risk of carcinoma in both breasts. However, the frequent association
  of LCIS with invasive lobular carcinoma ILC suggests a precursor-product relation.
  The possible genomic relation between synchronous LCIS and ILC was analyzed using
  the technique of array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH .
