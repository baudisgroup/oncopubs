abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization was used to characterize 22
  medulloblastomas in order to precisely define genetic alterations in these malignant
  childhood brain tumors. The 17p - 17q copy number abnormality CNA , consistent with
  the formation of isochromosome 17q, was the most common event 8 22 . Amplifications
  in this series included MYCL, MYCN and MYC previously implicated in medulloblastoma
  pathogenesis, as well as novel amplicons on chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and 12. Losses
  involving chromosomes 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 16 and 19 and gains of chromosomes 4, 7,
  8, 9 and 18 were seen in greater than 20 of tumors in this series. A homozygous
  deletion in 11p15 defines the minimal region of loss on this chromosome arm. In
  order to map the minimal regions involved in losses, gains and amplifications, we
  combined aCGH data from this series with that of two others obtained using the same
  RPCI BAC arrays. As a result of this combined analysis of 72 samples, we have defined
  specific regions on chromosomes 1, 8p, 10q, 11p and 16q which are frequently involved
  in CNAs in medulloblastomas. Using high density oligonucleotide expression arrays,
  candidate genes were identified within these consistently involved regions in a
  subset of the tumors.
