abstract: Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was applied
  on fifteen gastric cancer GCA samples to reveal information of DNA copy number changes
  at an exon-level resolution. Twelve of the samples represented the intestinal IGCA
  and three the diffuse DGCA type of GCA. The samples had previously been assessed
  for genetic stability by microsatellite analysis and categorized into microsatellite
  phenotypes according to the type of alterations. As compared to our previous results
  obtained using cDNA platforms, the oligonucleotide platforms revealed more aberrations
  per sample 0-45 vs. 0-22 . A total of 22 amplifications were detected by the oligonucleotide
  arrays. Ten of the amplicons had also been detected on the cDNA platform, but five
  of them spanned only one or a few cDNA clones, thus resembling apparent outliers.
  Two tumors showed five or more amplifications by oligonucleotide aCGH, suggesting
  the presence of an amplifier phenotype. The amplifications occurred irrespective
  of the microsatellite phenotypes. None of the DGCA tumors showed more than one aberration,
  whereas the IGCA tumors showed several aberrations. The increased resolution of
  the oligonucleotide arrays enabled the detection of amplicon boundaries at gene
  level, allowing, e.g., the determination of the 17q12 core amplicon and interstitial
  losses within the 8p23.1-- amp gt p22 and 20q13.2-- amp gt q13.1 amplifications.
  Previously no losses have been reported within amplified regions in GCA. In addition
  to novel amplified regions, the oligonucleotide array results describe novel targets
  for amplicons at 8p11 SFRP1 , 11p12 LRRC4C , and 19q13.2 CEACAM6 .
