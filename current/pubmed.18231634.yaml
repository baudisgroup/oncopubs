abstract: 'The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of FGFR3 mutations
  in bladder tumors of different grade and stage and determine the relation of mutations
  to chromosomal alterations detected by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . One
  hundred bladder cancer samples served as templates for manual microdissection. DNA
  was isolated from dissected samples containing at least 80 tumor cells. Mutations
  in FGFR3 were analyzed by SNaPshot analysis. CGH was carried out according to standard
  protocols. FGFR3 mutations were detected in 45 of 92 samples 48.9 . Concerning T-category,
  the following mutation frequencies occurred: pTa, 69 pT1, 38 and pT2-3, 0 . The
  mutation frequency was significantly associated with tumor grade: G1, 72 G2, 56
  and G3, 4 . In pTaG1 tumors, mutations were found in 74 . A significantly lower
  number of genetic alterations per tumor detected by CGH was associated with FGFR3
  mutations 2 vs 8 . This association was also seen in pTaG1 tumors: 2.5 with mutation
  vs 7.5 without mutation . FGFR3 mutations characterize noninvasive low-risk tumors
  of low malignancy. The low malignant potential of these tumors is underlined by
  a low number of genetic alterations per tumor. Therefore, FGFR3 represents a valuable
  prognostic marker of tumors with low malignant potential and can be used as surrogate
  marker for the detection of genetically stable bladder tumors.'
