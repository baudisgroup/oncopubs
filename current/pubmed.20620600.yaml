abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a technique that permits detection
  of chromosomal imbalances. This method allows the detection of gains and losses
  of genetic material at a resolution lower than 5 Mb. The limitations of conventional
  cytogenetic studies, such as morphologically insufficient quality of metaphases
  or the mitotic index, can be eliminated by use of CGH. It is particularly important
  in the diagnosis of leukemias, and CGH could be a useful tool enabling more precise
  cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells. A group of 89 children with acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia was studied by means of CGH using bone marrow obtained from all consecutive
  pediatric patients. CGH experiments were performed according to the manufacturers
  instruction with minor modifications. In addition, each sample was examined with
  standard GTG technique and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The conventional
  cytogenetics failed in 12 patients 13.5 , and 22 patients 24.7 had a normal karyotype.
  Structural and numerical changes were found in 55 cases 61.8 displaying a different
  abnormalities including deletions, trisomies, tetrasomies, isochromosomes, and markers
  with unknown origin. However, all samples were successfully analyzed by CGH. We
  have shown that high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization analysis is a
  reliable and relatively quick one-step method to identify main aberrations that
  would not be detected by either conventional G banding or by conventional fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. It should be considered to establish CGH as a routine analysis
  for screening patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
