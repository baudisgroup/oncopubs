abstract: Osteosarcoma is one of the most commonly biopsied primary tumor of bone.
  High-grade osteosarcomas in particular exhibit a wide spectrum of cytogenetic changes.
  Molecular cytogenetic studies on osteosarcomas have shown that genomic amplification,
  especially of both the TP53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an
  important role in the biology of these tumors. We applied CGH in order to obtain
  a global view of DNA-sequence losses and gains in osteosarcoma. CGH was performed
  on 20 high-grade medullary osteosarcomas 13 primary tumors prior to chemotherapy,
  5 tumors after chemotherapy, 2 established cell lines MB63, HOS58 using genomic
  DNA of snap-frozen tumor specimens. CGH revealed DNA copy number aberrations, mostly
  gains, in all the tumors studied with an average of 18.5 aberrations tumor range
  8-32 . High-level amplifications were observed in all cases average 4.1 amplifications
  tumor range 1-10 . Amplicons affecting at least five tumors were mapped to 1p21-31
  9 20 cases , 3q25-qter 6 20 , 6p12-21 6 20 , 8q12-qter 10 20 , 12p11-12 9 20 , 12q12-15
  enclosing MDM2 and SAS loci, 7 20 . Losses were most frequently seen at 3p, 10q,
  11p and 13 all 10 20 . In conclusion, our CGH data indicated that genomic amplification
  plays an important role in the biology of osteosarcoma. CGH demonstrated the complexity
  of genetic aberrations in osteosarcomas. The detection of novel non-random DNA amplifications
  in our study has defined regions for further targeted molecular genetic research
  aimed at identifying those oncogenes that are characteristic of osteosarcoma development.
