abstract: Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B LRP1B is frequently
  deleted in tumors of various types, but its status and expression in esophageal
  squamous cell carcinomas ESCs have never been reported. In the course of a program
  to screen ESC cell lines for copy-number aberrations using array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization, we identified a homozygous deletion of LRP1B. Genomic PCR
  experiments revealed homozygous deletions of LRP1B in additional ESC cell lines
  total, 6 of 43 14.0 and in primary esophageal tumors 30 of 70 42.9 . Moreover, expression
  of LRP1B mRNA was frequently silenced in ESC lines without homozygous deletions
  14 of 37 37.8 . Using bisulfite-PCR analysis and sequencing, we found that LRP1B-nonexpressing
  cells without homozygous deletions were highly methylated at a CpG island of LRP1B,
  a sequence possessing promoter activity. Treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine restored
  expression of LRP1B in those ESC lines. Histone acetylation status correlated directly
  with expression of LRP1B and inversely with the methylation status of the CpG island.
  Methylation of LRP1B was also detected in primary esophageal tumors. Restoration
  of LRP1B expression in ESC cells reduced colony formation. These results suggest
  that loss of LRP1B function in esophageal carcinogenesis most often occurs either
  by homozygous deletion or by transcriptional silencing through hypermethylation
  of its CpG island.
