abstract: The vast majority of colorectal cancers display genetic instability, either
  in the chromosomal instability CIN or microsatellite instability MIN forms. Although
  CIN tumors are per definition aneuploid, MIN colorectal cancers, caused by loss
  of mismatch repair function, are usually near diploid. Recently, biallelic germ
  line mutations in the MYH gene were found to be responsible for MYH-associated polyposis
  MAP , an autosomal recessive predisposition to multiple colorectal polyps, often
  indistinguishable from the dominant familial adenomatous polyposis FAP syndrome
  caused by inherited APC mutations. Here, we analyzed MYH- and APC-mutant polyps
  by combining laser capture microdissection, isothermal genomic DNA amplification,
  and array comparative genomic hybridization. Smoothed quantile regression methods
  were applied to the MAP and FAP genomic profiles to discriminate chromosomes predominantly
  affected by gains and losses. Up to 80 and 60 of the MAP and FAP polyps showed aneuploid
  changes, respectively. Both MAP and FAP adenomas were characterized by frequent
  losses at chromosome 1p, 17, 19, and 22 and gains affecting chromosomes 7 and 13.
  The aneuploid changes detected at early stages of MYH-driven tumorigenesis may underlie
  accelerated tumor progression, increased cancer risk, and poor prognosis in MAP.
