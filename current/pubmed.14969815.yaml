abstract: Tumors of different metastatic behavior possibly differ in genomic constitution.
  We identified molecular cytogenetic differences between a group of metastasized
  and nonmetastasized primary tongue tumors by comparative genomic hybridization.
  Most frequent chromosome copy number changes for metastasized and nonmetastasized
  tumors were 8q 100 and 71 , respectively and 3q 56 and 43 , respectively . Metastasized
  tumors showed significantly more chromosome copy number changes than nonmetastasized
  tumors. High copy number gains were exclusively found in metastasized tumors for
  3q23-qter, 5p, 12p and 13q21-q22. Genomic imbalances occurring in metastasized tumors
  but not in nonmetastasized tumours were 7q21 44 , 14q 33 , and -15q 33 . The genetic
  constitution of primary tongue tumors that metastasize differs from tongue tumors
  that do not metastasize. Our data, although obtained from a relative small group
  of tumors, spotlights copy number gain of chromosome region 7q21 as a potential
  marker for metastatic behavior.
