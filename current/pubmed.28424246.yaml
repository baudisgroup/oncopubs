abstract: Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL) is a lethal, and the most
  common, neoplastic complication of celiac disease. Here, we defined the genetic
  landscape of EATL through whole-exome sequencing of 69 EATL tumors. SETD2 was the
  most frequently silenced gene in EATL (32% of cases). The JAK-STAT pathway was the
  most frequently mutated pathway, with frequent mutations in STAT5B as well as JAK1,
  JAK3, STAT3, and SOCS1 We also identified mutations in KRAS, TP53, and TERT Type
  I EATL and type II EATL (monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma)
  had highly overlapping genetic alterations indicating shared mechanisms underlying
  their pathogenesis. We modeled the effects of SETD2 loss in vivo by developing a
  T cell-specific knockout mouse. These mice manifested an expansion of Î³Î´ T cells,
  indicating novel roles for SETD2 in T cell development and lymphomagenesis. Our
  data render the most comprehensive genetic portrait yet of this uncommon but lethal
  disease and may inform future classification schemes.
