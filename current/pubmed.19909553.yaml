abstract: Plasmablastic lymphoma PL is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  DLBCL . Studies have suggested that tumors with PL morphology represent a group
  of neoplasms with clinopathologic characteristics corresponding to different entities
  including extramedullary plasmablastic tumors associated with plasma cell myeloma
  PCM . The goal of the current study was to evaluate the genetic similarities and
  differences among PL, DLBCL AIDS-related and non AIDS-related and PCM using array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization.
