abstract: 'The study of genomic alterations in neuroblastoma is of particular importance
  since several cytogenetic markers proved to be closely associated with the clinical
  phenotype. To disclose patterns of gains and losses, we performed high-resolution
  oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . A total cohort
  of 90 patients was classified into 6 subsets according to tumor stage and outcome:
  Stages 1-3 with event , Stage 1-3- no event , Stage 4 -, and Stage 4S -. The aberration
  patterns in Stages 1-3- and 4S- tumors differed from all other groups as they were
  predominantly characterized by losses 3, 4, 14, X and gains 7, 17 of whole chromosomes.
  However, 59 65 91 tumors of Stages 1-3 or Stage 4 revealed numerous structural copy
  number alterations sCNA . While deletions in chromosomes 1, 3, and 11 discriminated
  outcome in Stage 4, there were no specific sCNA that distinguished tumor stage within
  the subgroup of unfavorable tumors. sCNA in 1p, 3p, 11q, 17q, or MYCN amplification
  MNA was seen among 22 24 patients who died, 10 12 with metastatic relapses, and
  5 9 with local recurrences. Detailed breakpoint analyses on chromosomes 1, 3, 11,
  and 17 disclosed preferred breaking areas, although breakpoints were not identical.
  Amplifications were found in 18 patients and involved 2p24 MYCN and other segments
  of chromosome 2, as well as regions on chromosome arms 6q, 12q, and 17q. One single
  feature in 21q21.1 BU678720, without known function yet attracted particular attention
  since five patients showed a homozygous loss of this sequence.'
