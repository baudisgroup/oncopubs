abstract: 'Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a high frequency
  of abnormal karyotypes some of which are related to outcome. Single nucleotide polymorphism
  (SNP) array analysis provides a highly sensitive platform to detect large and small
  genomic aberrations. SNP array profiling data in adult ALL are limited and further
  systematic studies of this patient group are needed. We performed a population-based
  SNP array analysis of genomic aberrations and their influence on survival in 66
  Lithuanian 18-65 year old ALL patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2013. Most aberrations
  were detected in chromosome arm 9p, chromosome arm 6q, chromosome arm 13q, and chromosome
  17. The recurrently targeted copy number abnormalities involved several leukemia-related
  genes-CDKN2A/B, MLL, IKZF1, PAX5, RB1, TP53, and ETV6. We identified several new
  recurrent aberrations with possible new target genes: SMARCA4 in 19p13.2, RNASEL
  in 1q25.3, ARHGEF12 in 11q23.3, and LYL1 in 19p13.2. Aberrations in chromosome 13
  and the RB1 gene as well as CDKN2A/B gene status were related to the outcome. ï¿½
