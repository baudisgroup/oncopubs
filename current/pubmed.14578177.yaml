abstract: Melanoma and benign melanocytic nevi can overlap significantly in their
  histopathological presentation and misdiagnoses are common. To determine whether
  genetic criteria can be of diagnostic help we determined DNA copy number changes
  in 186 melanocytic tumors 132 melanomas and 54 benign nevi using comparative genomic
  hybridization. We found highly significant differences between melanomas and nevi.
  Whereas 127 96.2 of the melanomas had some form of chromosomal aberration, only
  7 13.0 of the benign nevi cases had aberrations. All seven cases with aberrations
  were Spitz nevi, in six of which the aberration was an isolated gain involving the
  entire short arm of chromosome 11. This aberration was not observed in any of the
  132 melanomas. We also analyzed the 132 melanomas for genetic differences depending
  on anatomical site, Clarks histogenetic type, and sun-exposure pattern. We show
  that melanomas on acral sites have significantly more aberrations involving chromosomes
  5p, 11q, 12q, and 15, as well as focused gene amplifications. Melanomas classified
  as lentigo maligna melanomas or as occurring on severely sun-damaged skin showed
  markedly more frequent losses of chromosomes 17p and 13q. This study shows a pattern
  of chromosomal aberration in melanoma that is distinct from melanocytic nevi and
  should be further evaluated as a diagnostic test for melanocytic lesions that are
  now ambiguous. In addition, we show marked differences in the genetic make-up of
  melanomas that depend on anatomical location and sun-exposure pattern indicating
  that potential therapeutic targets might vary among melanoma types.
