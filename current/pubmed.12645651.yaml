abstract: Neuroblastoma exhibiting deletion of a segment of the long arm of chromosome
  11 represents a genetic subtype of tumor that is distinct from those exhibiting
  MYCN amplification or 1p deletion. The 11q- genetic subtype is further characterized
  by gain of 17q and loss of distal 3p material. Gain of 11p material has also been
  reported in neuroblastoma with 11q loss, but at a considerably lower frequency than
  gain of 17q or loss of the distal 3p region. Our results, however, indicate that
  gain of 11p may occur more frequently in 11q- neuroblastoma than what was previously
  realized. Comparative genomic hybridization analyses of neuroblastoma tissue from
  eleven patients indicated that six of 11 tumors 55 with loss of 11q also possessed
  gain of 11p. The shortest region of 11p gain was 11p11.2-- amp gt p14. G-banding
  and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis performed on tumor cells from primary
  and metastatic sites from one patient allowed us to infer that gain of 11p arose
  secondarily to the abnormality that led to the loss of 11q material. Gain of an
  entire chromosome 7 was detected in 17 of 43 40 tumors, whereas gain of 7q was detected
  in 5 of 43 12 tumors. Unlike gain of 11p, gain of an entire chromosome 7 appears
  to be prevalent in all tumor stages and is not limited to the 11q- tumor subtype.
  Gain of 7q, however, is more prevalent in higher stage tumors. G-band cytogenetic
  analysis indicated that an unbalanced t 3 7 was responsible for the gain of 7q and
  loss of 3p material in one case. We discuss the possibility that gain of 7 7q, and
  11p material may contribute to either tumorigenesis or progression.
