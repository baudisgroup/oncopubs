abstract: Endometrial cancer progression is determined by a complex pattern of multiple
  genetic aberrations, but how these aberrations affect prognosis is unknown. In this
  study, we undertook a genome-wide screening to detect genetic changes by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH in 51 tumors from patients with primary endometrioid carcinoma
  of the uterine corpus. The observed genetic changes were subsequently correlated
  with the progression of the disease and the clinical outcome in each case. The average
  number of genetic aberrations copy number gains and losses was significantly greater
  in non-surviving patients than in disease-free patients 12. 6 vs. 2.7, P amp lt
  0.0001 . According to multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis P 0.015 , cervical
  involvement P 0.007 and one or more copy number losses at 9q32-q34, 11q23, or Xq12-q24
  P 0.023 were significantly predictive of death from the disease. Interestingly,
  lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with copy number gains at 8q22-q23
  and 8q24-qter P 0.003 and P 0.025, respectively . Moreover, cervical involvement
  was also correlated significantly not only with gains of 8q22-q23 and 8q24-qter
  but also with loss of 11q23 P 0.04, 0.0003, and P 0. 009, respectively . These results
  suggest that analysis of genetic changes may help predict clinical outcome and the
  presence of metastatic disease as well as assist in therapeutic decision making
  for patients with endometrioid carcinoma.
