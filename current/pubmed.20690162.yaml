abstract: Primary effusion lymphoma PEL is associated with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus
  KSHV but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Many KSHV-associated products can
  deregulate cellular pathways commonly targeted in cancer. However, KSHV infection
  alone is insufficient for malignant transformation. PEL also lacks the chromosomal
  translocations seen in other lymphoma subtypes. We investigated 28 PELs and ten
  PEL cell lines by 1 Mb resolution array comparative genomic hybridization CGH and
  found frequent gains of 1q21-41 47 , 4q28.3-35 29 , 7q 58 , 8q 63 , 11 32 , 12 61
  , 17q 29 , 19p 34 , and 20q 34 , and losses of 4q 32 , 11q25 29 , and 14q32 63 .
  Recurrent focal amplification was seen at several regions on chromosomes 7, 8, and
  12. High-resolution chromosome-specific tile-path array CGH confirmed these findings,
  and identified selectin-P ligand SELPLG and coronin-1C CORO1C as the targets of
  a cryptic amplification at 12q24.11. Interphase FISH and quantitative PCR showed
  SELPLG CORO1C amplification amp gt 4 extra copies and low levels of copy number
  gain 1-4 extra copies in 23 of PELs, respectively. Immunohistochemistry revealed
  strong expression of both SELPLG and coronin-1C in the majority of PELs, irrespective
  of their gene dosage. SELPLG is critical for cell migration and chemotaxis, while
  CORO1C regulates actin-dependent processes, thus important for cell motility. Their
  overexpression in PEL is expected to play an important role in its pathogenesis.
