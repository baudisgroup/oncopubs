abstract: Isolated deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5, del 5q , are observed
  in 10 of myelodysplastic syndromes MDS and are associated with a more favorable
  prognosis, although the clinical course varies considerably. If one or more additional
  chromosomal aberrations are present, this correlates with a significantly shorter
  overall survival. To assess the frequency of hidden abnormalities in cases with
  an isolated cytogenetic del 5q , we have performed a genome wide high resolution
  44 K 60mer oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH study using
  DNA from bone marrow cells of 12 MDS and one AML patient. In one case a single additional
  hidden 5.6 Mb deletion of 13q14 and in another case multiple larger aberrations
  involving many chromosomes were found. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated
  that aberrations present in 35 of the bone marrow cells can be detected by aCGH.
  Furthermore with oligonucleotide aCGH the deletion end points in 5q were mapped
  precisely, revealing a cluster of proximal breakpoints in band q14.3 n 8 and a distal
  cluster between bands q33.2 and q34 n 11 . This study shows the high resolution
  of oligonucleotide CGH arrays for precisely mapping genomic alterations and for
  refinement of deletion end points. In addition, the high sensitivity of this method
  enables the study of whole bone marrow cells from MDS patients, a disease with a
  low blast count.
