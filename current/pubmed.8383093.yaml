abstract: A modification of amp quot reverse chromosome painting amp quot was carried
  out using genomic DNA from tumor cells as a complex probe for chromosomal in situ
  suppression hybridization to normal metaphase chromosome spreads. Amplified DNA
  sequences contained in such probes showed specific signals, revealing the normal
  chromosome positions from which these sequences were derived. As a model system,
  genomic DNAs were analyzed from three tumor cell lines with amplification units
  including the proto-oncogene c-myc. The smallest amplification unit was about 90
  kb and was present in 16-24 copies the largest unit was bigger than 600 kb and was
  present in 16-32 copies. Specific signals that co-localized with a differently labeled
  c-myc probe on chromosome band 8q24 were obtained with genomic DNA from each cell
  line. In further experiments, genomic DNA derived from primary tumor material was
  used in the case of a male patient with glioblastoma multiforme GBM . Southern blot
  analysis using an epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR probe that maps to
  7p13 indicated the amplification of sequences from this gene. Using reverse chromosome
  painting, signals were found both on band 7p13 and bands 12q13-q15. Notably, the
  signal on 12q13-q15 was consistently stronger. The weaker 7p13 signal showed co-localization
  with the major signal of the differently labeled EGFR probe. A minor signal of this
  probe was seen on 12q13, suggesting cross-hybridization to ERB3 sequences homologous
  to EGFR. The results indicate co-amplification of sequences from bands 12q13-q15,
  in addition to sequences from band 7p13. Several oncogenes map to 12q13-q15 providing
  candidate genes for a tumor-associated proto-oncogene amplification. Although the
  nature of the amplified sequences needs to be clarified, this experiment demonstrates
  the potential of reverse chromosome painting with genomic tumor DNA for rapidly
  mapping the normal chromosomal localization of the DNA from which the amplified
  sequences were derived. In addition, a weaker staining of chromosomes 10 and X was
  consistently observed indicating that these chromosomes were present in only one
  copy in the GBM genome. This rapid approach can be used to analyze cases where no
  metaphase spreads from the tumor material are available. It does not require any
  preknowledge of amplified sequences and can be applied to screen large numbers of
  tumors.
