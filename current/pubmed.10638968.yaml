abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was applied to squamous cell carcinomas
  SCC of the lung to define chromosomal imbalances that are associated with the metastatic
  phenotype. In total, 64 lung SCC from 50 patients were investigated, 25 each with
  or without evidence of metastasis formation. The chromosomal imbalances summarized
  by a CGH histogram of the 50 cases revealed deletions most frequently on chromosomes
  1p21-p31, 2q34-q36, 3p, 4p, 4q, 5q, 6q14-q24, 8p, 9p, 10q, 11p12-p14, 13q13-qter,
  18q12-qter and 21q21. DNA over-representations were most pronounced for chromosomes
  1q11-q25, 1q32-q41, 3q, 5p, 8q22-qter, 11q13, 12p, 17q21-q22, 17q24-q25, 19, 20q
  and 22q. In ten cases, paired samples of primaries and at least one metastasis were
  analysed. The comparison revealed a considerable chromosomal instability and genetic
  heterogeneity however, the CGH pattern indicated a clonal relationship in each case.
  The difference in histograms from the metastatic and non-metastatic tumour groups
  was most useful in pinpointing chromosomal imbalances associated with the metastatic
  phenotype, indicating that the deletions at 3p12-p14, 3p21, 4p15-p16, 6q24-qter,
  8p22-p23, 10q21-qter and 21q22, as well as the over-representations at 1q21-q25,
  8q, 9q34, 14q12 and 15q12-q15, occurred significantly more often in the metastatic
  tumour group. The comparison of the paired samples confirmed these findings in individual
  cases and suggested distinct genetic changes, in particular the extension of small
  interstitial deletions, during tumour progression. Importantly, metastasis-associated
  lesions were frequently detectable in the primary tumour providing a method of identifying
  patients at risk for tumour dissemination. Individual profiles and histograms are
  accessible at our web site http: amba.charite.de cgh.'
