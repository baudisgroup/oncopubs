abstract: The number of DNA losses found using comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  and the proliferation index MIB-1 have been shown to be prognostic factors in renal
  cell carcinoma RCC . We evaluated the associations of these two factors with each
  other and with histopathology and clinical outcome.
