abstract: 'In aplastic anemia AA , contraction of the stem cell pool may result in
  oligoclonality, while in myelodysplastic syndromes MDS a single hematopoietic clone
  often characterized by chromosomal aberrations expands and outcompetes normal stem
  cells. We analyzed patients with AA N 93 and hypocellular MDS hMDS, N 24 using single
  nucleotide polymorphism arrays SNP-A complementing routine cytogenetics. We hypothesized
  that clinically important cryptic clonal aberrations may exist in some patients
  with BM failure. Combined metaphase and SNP-A karyotyping improved detection of
  chromosomal lesions: 19 and 54 of AA and hMDS cases harbored clonal abnormalities
  including copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity UPD, 7 . Remarkably, lesions involving
  the HLA locus suggestive of clonal immune escape were found in 3 of 93 patients
  with AA. In hMDS, additional clonal lesions were detected in 5 36 of 14 patients
  with normal noninformative routine cytogenetics. In a subset of AA patients studied
  at presentation, persistent chromosomal genomic lesions were found in 10 of 33,
  suggesting that the initial diagnosis may have been hMDS. Similarly, using SNP-A,
  earlier clonal evolution was found in 4 of 7 AA patients followed serially. In sum,
  our results indicate that SNP-A identify cryptic clonal genomic aberrations in AA
  and hMDS leading to improved distinction of these disease entities.'
