abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ICC arises from epithelial cells in the
  intrahepatic bile duct. Until now, only few reports have been available concerning
  the genetic changes during the progression of ICC. In this study, we analyzed chromosomal
  aberrations in 19 frozen ICC samples using comparative genomic hybridization. The
  common chromosomal gains were observed in 8q22 approximately qter 11 cases, 58 ,
  5p14 approximately pter 32 , 2q33 approximately qter 26 , 7p 26 , 17q21 approximately
  q22 26 , 18q12 approximately q21 26 , and 19q13.1 26 . DNA amplification was identified
  in nine tumors 47 . Chromosomal loss was found in Y 60 , 1p34 approximately pter
  37 , 4q 32 , 18q21 approximately qter 32 19p 32 , X 32 , 5q11 approximately q14
  26 , 8p 26 , 9p 26 , and 17p 26 . Chromosomal aberrations identified in this study
  provide candidate regions involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of ICC.
