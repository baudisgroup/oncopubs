abstract: Splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma is characterized by high genetic heterogeneity,
  and hepatitis C virus infection seems to be involved in a subset of patients. The
  aims of the analysis were to identify potential genetic alterations related to hepatitis
  C virus status, IgV H gene mutational status, and prognostic categories identified
  in a multicenter study Blood 2006 107:4643 . Genome-wide array comparative genomic
  hybridization at a 100-kilobase kb resolution was performed in 34 patients with
  splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 12 of whom were hepatitis C virus positive.
  Array-comparative genomic hybridization experiments revealed no copy number alterations
  in 10 patients 4 were hepatitis C virus positive . A median of 5.6 and 3.8 copy
  number alterations were detected in hepatitis C virus-positive and in hepatitis
  C virus-negative patients, respectively. The most frequent copy number alterations
  involved chromosomes 7 and 17 21 and 24 , respectively . Except for Xp gain P .01
  , no differences in common alterations were found between hepatitis C virus-positive
  and hepatitis C virus-negative cases. Unmutated status of the IgV H gene was related
  to del 7q P .04 and dup 12q P .03 . The high-risk group identified according to
  the new splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma prognostic score was associated with
  del 7q P .01 and del 17p P .02 . Hepatitis C virus-positive splenic marginal zone
  B-cell lymphoma patients have no specific chromosome alterations. Patients with
  poor prognosis are characterized by distinctive imbalances.
