abstract: Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we have identified and mapped
  regions of DNA amplification in primary and metastatic osteosarcomas. Samples were
  obtained from four patients and ten independent xenografts. Sixty-four percent of
  the tumors showed increased DNA-sequence copy numbers, affecting 23 different chromosomal
  sites. Most of these regions were not previously associated with the development
  and or progression of these tumors. Amplicons originating from 1q21-q23, 6p, 8q23-qter,
  and 17p11-p12 were observed most frequently. The 6p and 17p11-p12 amplicons seem
  to be specific for osteosarcomas, indicating that these regions may harbor genes
  relevant for the development of these tumors.
