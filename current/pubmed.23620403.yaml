abstract: The identification of gene mutations and structural genomic aberrations
  that are critically involved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL pathogenesis is
  still evolving. One may postulate that genomic driver lesions with effects on CLL
  cell proliferation, apoptosis thresholds, or chemotherapy resistance should increase
  in frequency over time when measured sequentially in a large CLL cohort.
