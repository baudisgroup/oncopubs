abstract: Despite several loss of heterozygosity studies, a comprehensive genomic
  survey of pheochromocytomas is still lacking. To identify DNA copy number changes
  which might be important in tumor development and progression and which may have
  diagnostic utility, we evaluated genetic aberrations in 29 sporadic adrenal and
  extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas 19 clinically benign tumors and 10 malignant lesions
  . Comparative genomic hybridization was performed using directly fluorochrome-conjugated
  DNA extracted from frozen 16 and paraffin-embedded 13 tumor tissues. The most frequently
  observed changes were losses of chromosomes 1p11-p32 86 , 3q 52 , 6q 34 , 3p, 17p
  31 each , 11q 28 , and gains of chromosomes 9q 38 and 17q 31 . No amplification
  was identified and no difference between adrenal and extra-adrenal tumors was detected.
  Progression to malignant tumors was strongly associated with deletions of chromosome
  6q 60 versus 21 in clinically benign lesions, P 0.0368 and 17p 50 versus 21 . Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization confirmed the comparative genomic hybridization data of chromosomes
  1p, 3q, and 6q, and revealed aneuploidy in some tumors. Our results suggest that
  the development of pheochromocytomas is associated with specific genomic aberrations,
  such as losses of 1p, 3q, and 6q and gains of 9q and 17q. In particular, tumor suppressor
  genes on chromosomes 1p and 3q may be involved in early tumorigenesis, and deletions
  of chromosomes 6q and 17p in progression to malignancy.
