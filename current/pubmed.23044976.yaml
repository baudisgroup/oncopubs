abstract: Primary plasma cell leukemia pPCL is a rare, yet aggressive form of de novo
  plasma cell tumor, distinct from secondary PCL sPCL which represents a leukemic
  transformation of pre-existing multiple myeloma MM . Herein, we performed a comprehensive
  molecular analysis of a prospective series of pPCLs by means of FISH, single nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP array and gene expression profiling GEP . IGH translocations were
  identified in 87 of pPCL cases, with prevalence of t 11 14 40 and t 14 16 30.5 ,
  whereas the most frequent numerical alterations involved 1p 38 , 1q 48 , 6q 29 ,
  8p 42 , 13q 74 , 14q 71 , 16q 53 , and 17p 35 . We identified a minimal biallelic
  deletion 1.5 Mb in 8p21.2 encompassing the PPP2R2A gene, belonging to a family of
  putative tumor suppressors and found to be significantly down-regulated in deleted
  cases. Mutations of TP53 were identified in four cases, all but one associated with
  a monoallelic deletion of the gene, whereas activating mutations of the BRAF oncogene
  occurred in one case and were absent in N- and K-RAS. To evaluate the influence
  of allelic imbalances in transcriptional expression we performed an integrated genomic
  analysis with GEP data, showing a significant dosage effect of genes involved in
  transcription, translation, methyltransferase activity, apoptosis as well as Wnt
  and NF-kB signaling pathways. Overall, we provide a compendium of genomic alterations
  in a prospective series of pPCLs which may contribute to improve our understanding
  of the pathogenesis of this aggressive form of plasma cell dyscrasia and the mechanisms
  of tumor progression in MM.
