abstract: The 6q23-27 region, recurrently deleted in Sï¿½zary syndrome (SS), was characterized
  at the molecular level in 13 SS patients and SS cell line SeAx. Using fine-tiling
  comparative genomic hybridization, deletions within the 6q23-27 region were detected
  in half of the samples (six patients and SeAx). All samples with deletions were
  further analyzed by ligation-mediated PCR. In addition, in one patient sample and
  in SeAx, paired-end next-generation sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 Illumina
  platform. Using those techniques, 23 rearrangements associated with the deletions
  were identified. The majority of rearrangements showed enormous complexity and diversity,
  including eight inversions, three transpositions, and four translocations (with
  chromosomes 3, 17, 10, and 12). Fifteen genes were disrupted by those rearrangements,
  the MYB proto-oncogene three times and the interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-2
  gene (IL22RA2) twice. All three patients with MYB alterations showed low MYB expression,
  whereas seven of the remaining patients showed overexpression. Most patients overexpressing
  MYB also presented increased expression of MYC, HSPA8, and BCL2. Five gene fusions
  were identified, of which two, CCDC28A-IL22RA2 and AIG1-GOSR1, both in SeAx, were
  in the same orientation and were expressed at the messenger RNA level.
