abstract: "Selecting colorectal cancer (CRC) patients likely to respond to therapy
  remains a clinical challenge. The objectives of this study were to establish which
  genes were differentially expressed with respect to treatment sensitivity and relate
  this to copy number in a panel of 15 CRC cell lines. Copy number variations of the
  identified genes were assessed in a cohort of CRCs. IC50's were measured for 5-fluorouracil,
  oxaliplatin, and BEZ-235, a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Cell lines were profiled using
  array comparative genomic hybridisation, Illumina gene expression analysis, reverse
  phase protein arrays, and targeted sequencing of KRAS hotspot mutations. Frequent
  gains were observed at 2p, 3q, 5p, 7p, 7q, 8q, 12p, 13q, 14q, and 17q and losses
  at 2q, 3p, 5q, 8p, 9p, 9q, 14q, 18q, and 20p. Frequently gained regions contained
  EGFR, PIK3CA, MYC, SMO, TRIB1, FZD1, and BRCA2, while frequently lost regions contained
  FHIT and MACROD2. TRIB1 was selected for further study. Gene enrichment analysis
  showed that differentially expressed genes with respect to treatment response were
  involved in Wnt signalling, EGF receptor signalling, apoptosis, cell cycle, and
  angiogenesis. Stepwise integration of copy number and gene expression data yielded
  47 candidate genes that were significantly correlated. PDCD6 was differentially
  expressed in all three treatment responses. Tissue microarrays were constructed
  for a cohort of 118 CRC patients and TRIB1 and MYC amplifications were measured
  using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. TRIB1 and MYC were amplified in 14.5%
  and 7.4% of the cohort, respectively, and these amplifications were significantly
  correlated (pâ\x89¤0.0001). TRIB1 protein expression in the patient cohort was significantly
  correlated with pERK, Akt, and Caspase 3 expression. In conclusion, a set of candidate
  predictive biomarkers for 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and BEZ235 are described
  that warrant further study. Amplification of the putative oncogene TRIB1 has been
  described for the first time in a cohort of CRC patients."
