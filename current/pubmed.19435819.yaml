abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme GBM is an extremely malignant brain tumor. To identify
  new genomic alterations in GBM, genomic DNA of tumor tissue explants from 55 individuals
  and 6 GBM cell lines were examined using single nucleotide polymorphism DNA microarray
  SNP-Chip . Further gene expression analysis relied on an additional 56 GBM samples.
  SNP-Chip results were validated using several techniques, including quantitative
  PCR Q-PCR , nucleotide sequencing, and a combination of Q-PCR and detection of microsatellite
  markers for loss of heterozygosity with normal copy number acquired uniparental
  disomy AUPD . Whole genomic DNA copy number in each GBM sample was profiled by SNP-Chip.
  Several signaling pathways were frequently abnormal. Either the p16 INK4A p15 INK4B
  -CDK4 6-pRb or p14 ARF -MDM2 4-p53 pathways were abnormal in 89 49 of 55 of cases.
  Simultaneous abnormalities of both pathways occurred in 84 46 of 55 samples. The
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway was altered in 71 39 of 55 GBMs either by deletion
  of PTEN or amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor and or vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha. Deletion of
  chromosome 6q26-27 often occurred 16 of 55 samples . The minimum common deleted
  region included PARK2, PACRG, QKI, and PDE10A genes. Further reverse transcription
  Q-PCR studies showed that PARK2 expression was decreased in another collection of
  GBMs at a frequency of 61 34 of 56 of samples. The 1p36.23 region was deleted in
  35 19 of 55 of samples. Notably, three samples had homozygous deletion encompassing
  this site. Also, a novel internal deletion of a putative tumor suppressor gene,
  LRP1B, was discovered causing an aberrant protein. AUPDs occurred in 58 32 of 55
  of the GBM samples and five of six GBM cell lines. A common AUPD was found at chromosome
  17p13.3-12 included p53 gene in 13 of 61 samples and cell lines. Single-strand conformational
  polymorphism and nucleotide sequencing showed that 9 of 13 of these samples had
  homozygous p53 mutations, suggesting that mitotic recombination duplicated the abnormal
  p53 gene, probably providing a growth advantage to these cells. A significantly
  shortened survival time was found in patients with 13q14 RB deletion or 17p13.1
  p53 deletion AUPD. Taken together, these results suggest that this technique is
  a rapid, robust, and inexpensive method to profile genome-wide abnormalities in
  GBM.
