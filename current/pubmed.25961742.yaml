abstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by the lack of expression
  of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal receptor 2,
  is an aggressive form of breast cancer that is more prevalent in certain populations,
  in particular in low- and middle-income regions. The detailed molecular features
  of TNBC in these regions remain unexplored as samples are mostly accessible as formalin-fixed
  paraffin embedded (FFPE) archived tissues, a challenging material for advanced genomic
  and transcriptomic studies. Using dedicated reagents and analysis pipelines, we
  performed whole exome sequencing and miRNA and mRNA profiling of 12 FFPE tumor tissues
  collected from pathological archives in Mexico. Sequencing analyses of the tumor
  tissues and their blood pairs identified TP53 and RB1 genes as the most frequently
  mutated genes, with a somatic mutation load of 1.7 mutations/exome Mb on average.
  Transcriptional analyses revealed an overexpression of growth-promoting signals
  (EGFR, PDGFR, VEGF, PIK3CA, FOXM1), a repression of cell cycle control pathways
  (TP53, RB1), a deregulation of DNA-repair pathways, and alterations in epigenetic
  modifiers through miRNA:mRNA network de-regulation. The molecular programs identified
  were typical of those described in basal-like tumors in other populations. This
  work demonstrates the feasibility of using archived clinical samples for advanced
  integrated genomics analyses. It thus opens up opportunities for investigating molecular
  features of tumors from regions where only FFPE tissues are available, allowing
  retrospective studies on the search for treatment strategies or on the exploration
  of the geographic diversity of breast cancer.
