abstract: This study aims to determine the effect of loss of breast cancer metastasis
  suppressor 1 BRMS1 protein expression on disease-free survival in breast cancer
  patients stratified by estrogen receptor ER , progesterone receptor PR , or HER2
  status, and to determine whether loss of BRMS1 protein expression correlated with
  genomic copy number changes.
