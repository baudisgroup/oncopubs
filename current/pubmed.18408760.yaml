abstract: Pilocytic astrocytomas PAs, WHO grade I are the most common brain tumors
  in the pediatric and adolescent population, accounting for approximately one-fifth
  of central nervous system tumors. Because few consistent molecular alterations have
  been identified in PAs compared to higher grade gliomas, we performed array comparative
  genomic hybridization using two independent commercial array platforms. Although
  whole chromosomal gains and losses were not observed, a 1-Mb amplified region of
  7q34 was detected in multiple patient samples using both array platforms. Copy-number
  gain was confirmed in an independent tumor sample set by quantitative PCR, and this
  amplification was correlated to both increased mRNA and protein expression of HIPK2,
  a homeobox-interacting protein kinase associated with malignancy, contained within
  this locus. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type HIPK2, but not a kinase-inactive
  mutant, in a glioma cell line conferred a growth advantage in vitro. Collectively,
  these results illustrate the power and necessity of implementing high-resolution,
  multiple-platform genomic analyses to discover small and subtle, but functionally
  significant, genomic alterations associated with low-grade tumor formation and growth.
