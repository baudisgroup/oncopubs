abstract: Insulinomas represent the predominant syndromic subtype of endocrine pancreatic
  tumors EPTs . Their metastatic potential cannot be predicted reliably using histopathological
  criteria. In the past few years, several attempts have been made to identify prognostic
  markers, among them TP53 mutations and immunostaining of p53 and recently cytokeratin
  19 CK19 . In a previous study using conventional comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH we have shown that chromosomal instability CIN is associated with metastatic
  disease in insulinomas. It was our aim to evaluate these potential parameters in
  a single study. For the determination of CIN, we applied CGH to microarrays because
  it allows a high-resolution detection of DNA copy number changes in comparison with
  conventional CGH as well as the analysis of chromosomal regions close to the centromeres
  and telomeres, and at 1pter-- amp gt p32, 16p, 19 and 22. These regions are usually
  excluded from conventional CGH analysis, because they may show DNA gains in negative
  control hybridizations. Array CGH analysis of 30 insulinomas 15 tumors of benign,
  eight tumors of uncertain and seven tumors of malignant behavior revealed that amp
  gt or 20 chromosomal alterations and amp gt or 6 telomeric losses were the best
  predictors of malignant progression. A subset of 22 insulinomas was further investigated
  for TP53 exon 5-8 gene mutations, and p53 and CK19 expression. Only one malignant
  tumor was shown to harbor an arginine 273 serine mutation and immunopositivity for
  p53. CK19 immunopositivity was detected in three malignant tumors and one tumor
  with uncertain behavior. In conclusion, our results indicate that CIN as well as
  telomeric loss are very powerful indicators for malignant progression in sporadic
  insulinomas. Our data do not support a critical role for p53 and CK19 as molecular
  parameters for this purpose.
