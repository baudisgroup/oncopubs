abstract: Mantle cell lymphomas MCLs are characterized by 11q13 chromosomal translocations
  and cyclin D1 overexpression. The secondary genetic and molecular events involved
  in the progression of these tumors are not well known. In this study, we have analyzed
  45 MCLs 32 typical and 13 blastoid variants by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . To identify the possible genes included in the abnormal chromosome regions,
  selected cases were analyzed for P53, P16 INK4a , RB, C-MYC, N-MYC, BCL2, BCL6,
  CDK4, and BMI-1 gene alterations. The most frequent imbalances detected by CGH were
  gains of chromosomes 3q 49 , 7p 27 , 8q 22 , 12q 20 , 18q 18 , and 9q34 16 and losses
  of chromosomes 13 44 , 6q 27 , 1p 24 , 11q14-q23 22 , 10p14-p15 18 , 17p 16 , and
  9p 16 . High-level DNA amplifications were identified in 11 different regions of
  the genome, predominantly in 3q27-q29 13 , 18q23 9 , and Xq28 7 . The CGH analysis
  allowed the identification of regional consensus areas in most of the frequently
  involved chromosomes. Chromosome gains P . 02 and losses P .01 and DNA amplifications
  P .015 were significantly higher in blastoid variants. The significant differences
  between blastoid and typical tumors were gains of 3q, 7p, and 12q, and losses of
  17p. CGH losses of 17p correlated with P53 gene deletions and mutations. Similarly,
  gains of 12q and high-level DNA amplifications of 10p12-p13 were associated with
  CDK4 and BMI-1 gene amplifications, respectively. One of 2 cases with 8q24 amplification
  showed C-MYC amplification by Southern blot. Alterations in 2p, 3q, 13, and 18q
  were not associated with N-MYC, BCL6, RB, or BCL2 alterations, respectively, suggesting
  that other genes may be the targets of these genetic abnormalities in MCLs. Increased
  number of gains 0 v 1-4 v amp gt 4 gains per case P .002 , gains of 3q P .02 , gains
  of 12q P .03 , and losses of 9p P . 003 were significantly associated with a shorter
  survival of the patients. These results indicate that an increased number of chromosome
  imbalances are associated with blastoid variants of MCLs and may have prognostic
  significance.
