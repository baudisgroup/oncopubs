abstract: The aim of the present study was to detect complex genetic alterations in
  human glioblastoma multiforme GBM by comparative genomic in situ hybridization CGH
  . Of the 24 GBM that were examined, increased fluorescence intensities indicating
  chromosomal polysomy of chromosome 7 and gene amplification at chromosome 7p were
  found in 42 of the tumors. In addition, signal enhancement of chromosome 19 was
  present in 29 and at 12q13-15 in 21 of the tumors. We also detected reduction of
  fluorescence intensities indicating gross deletions on chromosomes 10 58 , 9p 46
  , and 13 29 . There was a close correlation of CGH results when compared with Southern
  analysis of the EGFR gene localized on chromosome 7 and loss of heterozygosity detection
  of chromosome 9 and 10 by microsatellite PCR. A close correlation was also observed
  between copy number changes of chromosome 7 and deletions of chromosome 10. Amplification
  of chromosome 12q and deletions of chromosomes 9p and 13 seemed to be complementary
  in the tumors investigated in the present study.
