abstract: Despite the excellent survival of Wilms tumour patients treated with multimodality
  therapy, approximately 15 will suffer from tumour relapse, where response rates
  are markedly reduced. We have carried out microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation
  on a series of 76 Wilms tumour samples, enriched for cases which recurred, to identify
  changes in DNA copy number associated with clinical outcome. Using 1Mb-spaced genome-wide
  BAC arrays, the most significantly different genomic changes between favourable
  histology tumours that did n 37 , and did not n 39 , subsequently relapse were gains
  on 1q, and novel deletions at 12q24 and 18q21. Further relapse-associated loci included
  losses at 1q32.1, 2q36.3-2q37.1, and gain at 13q31. 1q gains correlated strongly
  with loss of 1p and or 16q. In 3 of 11 cases with concurrent 1p - 1q , a breakpoint
  was identified at 1p13. Multiple low-level sub-megabase gains along the length of
  1q were identified using chromosome 1 tiling-path arrays. One such recurrent region
  at 1q22-q23.1 included candidate genes RAB25, NES, CRABP2, HDGF and NTRK1, which
  were screened for mRNA expression using quantitative RT-PCR. These data provide
  a high-resolution catalogue of genomic copy number changes in relapsing favourable
  histology Wilms tumours.
