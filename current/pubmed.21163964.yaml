abstract: Medulloblastoma MB is the most common malignant brain tumor of children.
  To identify the genetic alterations in this tumor type, we searched for copy number
  alterations using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding
  genes and microRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 MBs. We found that,
  on average, each tumor had 11 gene alterations, fewer by a factor of 5 to 10 than
  in the adult solid tumors that have been sequenced to date. In addition to alterations
  in the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, our analysis led to the discovery of genes not
  previously known to be altered in MBs. Most notably, inactivating mutations of the
  histone-lysine N-methyltransferase genes MLL2 or MLL3 were identified in 16 of MB
  patients. These results demonstrate key differences between the genetic landscapes
  of adult and childhood cancers, highlight dysregulation of developmental pathways
  as an important mechanism underlying MBs, and identify a role for a specific type
  of histone methylation in human tumorigenesis.
