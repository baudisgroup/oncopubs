abstract: Cancer development is presumed to be an evolutionary process that is influenced
  by genetic background and environment. In laboratory animals, genetics and environment
  are variables that can largely be held constant. In humans, it is possible to compare
  independent tumours that have developed in the same patient, effectively constraining
  genetic and environmental variation and leaving only stochastic processes. Patients
  affected with von Hippel-Lindau disease are at risk of developing multiple independent
  clear cell renal carcinomas. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing on 40 tumours
  from six von Hippel-Lindau patients. We confirm that the tumours are clonally independent,
  having distinct somatic single-nucleotide variants. Although tumours from the same
  patient show many differences, within-patient patterns are discernible. Single-nucleotide
  substitution type rates are significantly different between patients and show biases
  in trinucleotide mutation context. We also observe biases in chromosome copy number
  aberrations. These results show that genetic background and/or environment can influence
  the types of mutations that occur.
