abstract: Myeloma is a clonal malignancy of plasma cells. Poor-prognosis risk is currently
  identified by clinical and cytogenetic features. However, these indicators do not
  capture all prognostic information. Gene expression analysis can be used to identify
  poor-prognosis patients and this can be improved by combination with information
  about DNA-level changes.
