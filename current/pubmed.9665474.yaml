abstract: To study the genetic basis of tumor progression, we have screened 37 hormone-refractory
  prostate carcinomas for genetic changes by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . All recurrent tumors showed genetic aberrations, with a mean total number of changes
  per tumor of 11.4 range, 3 to 23 . The most common genetic aberrations were losses
  of 8p 72.5 , 13q 50 , 1p 50 , 22 45 , 19 45 , 10q 42.5 , and 16q 42.5 and gains
  of 8q 72.5 , 7q 40 , Xq 32.5 , and 18q 32.5 . The CGH results were further validated
  with fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH using probes for pericentromeric regions
  of chromosomes 7, 8, and 18 as well as probes for caveolin 7q31 , c-myc 8q24 , and
  bcl-2 18q21.3 . In addition, the samples had previously been analyzed for androgen
  receptor gene copy number. CGH and FISH results were concordant in 78 of cases.
  Seventeen of twenty-two tumors showed an increased copy number of c-myc by FISH.
  However, only 5 of 17 29 of the cases showed high-level more than threefold amplification.
  Both CGH and FISH findings suggested that in most of the cases 8q gain involves
  the whole q-arm of the chromosome. Four of seventeen 24 cases showed increased copy
  number of bcl-2 by FISH however, no high-level amplifications were found. To evaluate
  the clonal relationship of the primary and recurrent tumors, six primary-recurrent
  tumor pairs from the same patients were studied by CGH. In three of six cases 50
  , the recurrent tumor had more than one-half of the aberrations found in the corresponding
  primary tumor, indicating a close clonal relationship. In the rest of the cases,
  such a linear clonal relationship was less evident. Altogether, these results suggest
  that recurrent prostate carcinomas are genetically unstable. The resulting heterogeneity
  may well underlie the poor responsiveness of hormone-refractory tumors to treatment.
