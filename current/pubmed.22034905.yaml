abstract: Whole genome-scale integrated analyses of exon array and array-comparative
  genomic hybridization are expected to enable the identification of unknown genetic
  features of cancer cells. Here, we evaluated this approach in 22 gastric and colorectal
  cancer cell lines, focusing on protein kinase genes and genes belonging to the cadherin-catenin
  family. Regarding alternative splicing patterns, several cancer cell lines predominantly
  expressed isoform 1 of protein kinase A catalytic subunit beta PRKACB . Paired gastric
  cancer specimens demonstrated that isoform 1 of PRKACB was a novel cancer-related
  variant transcript in gastric cancers. In addition, the exon array analysis clearly
  identified exon 3 or exon 3-4 skipping in catenin beta 1, a short intron insertion
  with exon 9 skipping in CDH1, and a deletional transcript of CDH13. These abnormal
  transcripts were shown to have arisen from small genomic deletions. Meanwhile, an
  integrated analysis of 11 gastric cancer cell lines revealed that four cell lines
  amplified fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, with truncated forms observed in
  two of the cell lines. Gene amplification, and not the truncated form, was found
  to determine the sensitivity to a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, indicating
  that our cell line panel might be useful for cell-based evaluations of specific
  inhibitors. Using an integrated analysis, we identified several abnormal transcripts
  and genomic alterations in gastric and colorectal cancer cells. Our approach might
  enable genetic changes to be identified more efficiently, and the present results
  warrant further investigation using clinical samples and integrated analyses.
