abstract: Stable cell lines obtained by spontaneous immortalization might represent
  early stages of malignant transformation and be useful experimental models for studies
  of mechanisms of cancer development. The FHC fetal human cells cell line has been
  established from normal fetal colonic mucosa. Detailed characterization of this
  cell line and mechanism of spontaneously acquired immortality have not been described
  yet. Therefore, we characterized the FHC cell line in terms of its tumorigenicity,
  cytogenetics, and TP53 gene mutation analysis. FHC cells displayed capability for
  anchorage-independent growth in semisolid media in vitro and formed solid tumors
  after transplantation into SCID severe combined immunodeficiency mice. This tumorigenic
  phenotype was associated with hypotriploidy and chromosome number ranging from 66
  to 69. Results of comparative genetic hybridization arrays showed that most chromosomes
  included regions of copy number gains or losses. Region 8q23 approximately 8q24.3
  containing, e.g., MYC proto-oncogene was present in more than 20 copies per nucleus.
  Moreover, we identified mutation of TP53 gene in codon 273 triplet CGT coding Arg
  was changed to CAG coding His. Expression of Pro codon 72 polymorphic variant of
  p53 was also detected. Mutation of TP53 gene was associated with abolished induction
  of p21 Waf1 Cip1 and MDM-2 proteins and resistance to apoptosis after genotoxic
  treatment. Because of their origin from normal fetal colon and their relative resistance
  to the induction of apoptosis, FHC cells can be considered a valuable experimental
  model for various studies.
