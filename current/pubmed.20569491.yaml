abstract: Cancer is a heterogeneous disease caused by genomic aberrations and characterized
  by significant variability in clinical outcomes and response to therapies. Several
  subtypes of common cancers have been identified based on alterations of individual
  cancer genes, such as HER2, EGFR, and others. However, cancer is a complex disease
  driven by the interaction of multiple genes, so the copy number status of individual
  genes is not sufficient to define cancer subtypes and predict responses to treatments.
  A classification based on genome-wide copy number patterns would be better suited
  for this purpose.
