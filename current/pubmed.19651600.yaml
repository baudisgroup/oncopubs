abstract: Cytogenetic analysis of acute myeloid leukemia AML cells has accelerated
  the identification of genes important for AML pathogenesis. To complement cytogenetic
  studies and to identify genes altered in AML genomes, we performed genome-wide copy
  number analysis with paired normal and tumor DNA obtained from 86 adult patients
  with de novo AML using 1.85 million feature SNP arrays. Acquired copy number alterations
  CNAs were confirmed using an ultra-dense array comparative genomic hybridization
  platform. A total of 201 somatic CNAs were found in the 86 AML genomes mean, 2.34
  CNAs per genome , with French-American-British system M6 and M7 genomes containing
  the most changes 10-29 CNAs per genome . Twenty-four percent of AML patients with
  normal cytogenetics had CNA, whereas 40 of patients with an abnormal karyotype had
  additional CNA detected by SNP array, and several CNA regions were recurrent. The
  mRNA expression levels of 57 genes were significantly altered in 27 of 50 recurrent
  CNA regions amp lt 5 megabases in size. A total of 8 uniparental disomy UPD segments
  were identified in the 86 genomes 6 of 8 UPD calls occurred in samples with a normal
  karyotype. Collectively, 34 of 86 AML genomes 40 contained alterations not found
  with cytogenetics, and 98 of these regions contained genes. Of 86 genomes, 43 50
  had no CNA or UPD at this level of resolution. In this study of 86 adult AML genomes,
  the use of an unbiased high-resolution genomic screen identified many genes not
  previously implicated in AML that may be relevant for pathogenesis, along with many
  known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
