abstract: Adrenocortical carcinomas ACCs are aggressive cancers originating in the
  cortex of the adrenal gland. Despite overall poor prognosis, ACC outcome is heterogeneous.
  We performed exome sequencing and SNP array analysis of 45 ACCs and identified recurrent
  alterations in known driver genes CTNNB1, TP53, CDKN2A, RB1 and MEN1 and in genes
  not previously reported in ACC ZNRF3, DAXX, TERT and MED12 , which we validated
  in an independent cohort of 77 ACCs. ZNRF3, encoding a cell surface E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, was the most frequently altered gene 21 and is a potential new tumor suppressor
  gene related to the beta-catenin pathway. Our integrated genomic analyses further
  identified two distinct molecular subgroups with opposite outcome. The C1A group
  of ACCs with poor outcome displayed numerous mutations and DNA methylation alterations,
  whereas the C1B group of ACCs with good prognosis displayed specific deregulation
  of two microRNA clusters. Thus, aggressive and indolent ACCs correspond to two distinct
  molecular entities driven by different oncogenic alterations.
