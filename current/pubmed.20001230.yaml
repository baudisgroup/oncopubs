abstract: We studied a series of 68 subjects diagnosed with childhood acute myeloid
  leukemia AML using conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH , polymerase chain reaction PCR to analyze mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 genes,
  and or array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Cytogenetic FISH abnormalities
  were observed in 71 of subjects, FLT3-ITD mutations in 15 , and NPM1 mutations in
  13 . The array CGH alterations average 3.6 per case were observed in 96 of the tested
  subjects. The most frequent alterations were gains of 8q24.3 and 11p15.5-p15.4 in
  16 of the samples. Six genes AKT1, RUNX1, LTB, SDC1, RUNX1T1, and JAK2 from the
  imbalanced regions have been reported to be involved in AML, whereas other 30 cancer
  genes, not previously reported in an AML context, were identified as imbalanced.
  They probably correspond to non passenger alterations that cooperate with the recurrent
  translocations. The clinical data and genetic changes were tested to find out the
  possible association with prognosis. Genomic instability four or more genomic imbalances
  was correlated with poor patient outcome p 0.029 .
