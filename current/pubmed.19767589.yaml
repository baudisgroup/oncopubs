abstract: In 5 to 10 of cases, neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by microdeletions
  scattered across the entire NF1 gene and various neighboring genes. The phenotype
  appears to be more severe in patients with NF1 microdeletions than in patients with
  NF1 single point mutations. We have developed a new method for detecting and characterizing
  NF1 microdeletions based on a custom high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative
  genomic hybridization by using the custom 8x15K Agilent array format. The array
  comprised a total of 14,207 oligonucleotide probes spanning the whole of chromosome
  17, including 12,314 probes spanning an approximately 8 Mb interval surrounding
  the NF1 locus. We validated this approach by testing NF1 microdeleted DNA samples
  previously characterized by means of microsatellites and real-time PCR methods.
  Our array comparative genomic hybridization provided enough information for subsequent
  long-range PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the microdeletion endpoints. Unlike
  previously described methods, our array comparative genomic hybridization was able
  to unambiguously differentiate between the three types of microdeletions type I,
  type II, and atypical and to characterize atypical microdeletions. Further comparative
  studies of patients with well-characterized genotypes and phenotypes and different
  microdeletions sizes and breakpoints will help determine whether haploinsufficiency
  of deleted genes and or genes rearrangements influence clinical outcomes.
