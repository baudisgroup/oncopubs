abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most frequent human malignancies,
  especially in Asia and Africa, but also in the Western world its incidence is increasing.
  HCC is a complication of chronic liver disease with cirrhosis as the most important
  risk factor. Viral co-pathogenesis due to hepatitis B virus HBV and hepatitis C
  virus HCV infection seems to be an important factor in the development of HCC. Curative
  therapy is often not possible due to the late detection of HCC. Thus, it is attractive
  to find parameters which predict malignant transformation in HBV- and HCV-infected
  livers. In the past decade, preneoplastic lesions, i.e. dysplastic foci or nodules,
  have gained interest as possible markers for imminent malignancy. Noteworthy, dysplastic
  liver lesions are increasingly detected by imaging techniques. We describe here
  two cases of chronic viral liver disease, one HBV-and one HCV-related, in which
  dysplastic lesions were present adjacent to HCC. In the HBV case, a smaller satellite
  of HCC was present as well. The neoplastic specimens were investigated by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and in situ hybridization ISH . Both methods revealed
  multiple genetic alterations in the HCCs. The genetic patterns of the HBV-related
  HCC and the satellite tumor showed many shared alterations suggesting a clonal relationship.
  A subset of genetic changes were already present in dysplasias illustrating their
  preneoplastic nature. Surrounding liver cirrhosis samples did not display chromosomal
  aberrations. A literature survey illustrates the relative paucity of information
  concerning genetic alterations in preneoplastic liver lesions. However, all the
  data strongly suggests a role for liver cell dysplasia as a precursor condition
  of liver cell cancer.
