abstract: 'ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS has been accepted
  as a marker of risk for the development of invasive breast cancer, yet modern models
  of breast carcinogenesis include LCIS as a precursor of low-grade carcinomas. We
  provide evidence favoring a clonal origin for LCIS and synchronous estrogen receptor-positive
  malignant lesions of the ductal and lobular phenotype. METHODS: Patients with prior
  LCIS undergoing mastectomy were identified preoperatively from 2003 to 2008. Specimens
  were widely sampled, and frozen blocks were screened for LCIS and co-existing malignant
  lesions, and were subject to microdissection. Samples from 65 patients were hybridized
  to the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array platform. Cases with both an LCIS sample and an
  associated ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS or invasive tumor sample were evaluated
  for patterns of somatic copy number changes to assess evidence of clonal relatedness.
  RESULTS: LCIS was identified in 44 of the cases, and among these a DCIS and or invasive
  lesion was also identified in 21 cases. A total of 17 tumor pairs had adequate DNA
  array data for analysis, including nine pairs of LCIS invasive lobular cancer, four
  pairs of LCIS DCIS, and four pairs of LCIS invasive ductal cancer. Overall, seven
  pairs 41 were judged to be clonally related in five 29 evidence suggested clonality
  but was equivocal, and five 29 were considered independent. Clonal pairs were observed
  with all matched lesion types and low and high histological grades. We also show
  anecdotal evidence of clonality between a patient-matched triplet of LCIS, DCIS,
  and invasive ductal cancer. CONCLUSION: Our results support the role of LCIS as
  a precursor in the development of both high-grade and low-grade ductal and lobular
  cancers.'
