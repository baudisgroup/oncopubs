abstract: Interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma IDCS is a rare tumor derived from
  interdigitating dendritic cells. Three cases of IDCS associated with chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma CLL SLL have been described, but no clonal relationship
  between the 2 neoplasms was demonstrated. We present a detailed case analysis of
  a CLL SLL with metachronous IDCS and demonstrate that these 2 neoplasms are clonally
  related. The IDCS and CLL cells had trisomy 12 and identical monoclonal immunoglobulin
  heavy chain gene rearrangements. Analysis of transcription factors with a role in
  myeloid differentiation demonstrated PU.1 up-regulation and C EBPalpha down-regulation
  in IDCS compared with CLL. High-density array comparative genomic hybridization
  also identified gains in part of chromosome 16q in IDCS. Our study demonstrates
  for the first time clonal transformation of CLL SLL into IDCS. This phenomenon may
  be triggered by alterations in lineage-determining transcription programs, which
  result in transdifferentiation, coupled with additional oncogenic stimuli caused
  by chromosomal imbalances.
