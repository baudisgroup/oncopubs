abstract: We studied chromosomal abnormalities by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and flow cytometry in anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC , and when present in coexisting
  or previous differentiated thyroid cancer DTC . Overall 10 frozen tissues from patients
  with ATC and 5 cell lines 1 ATC and 4 DTCs were analyzed. We found chromosomal abnormalities
  in 5 of 10 ATC tissues, with 24 abnormalities 22 gains and 2 losses . Among 8 ATCs
  that were associated with prior or concurrent DTC, more chromosomal abnormalities
  were found in ATC associated with follicular thyroid cancer FTC than those associated
  with PTC median numbers 9.5 and 0.5, respectively, p 0.046 or no associated differentiated
  thyroid cancer. Gain of 1q was relatively common in ATCs 30 . By flow cytometry,
  we found aneuploidy in 6 of 10 ATC tissues and diploidy in 4. There was concordance
  between DNA aneuploidy and the presence of chromosomal abnormalities by CGH in 4
  of the 5 ATCs p 0.048 . We also found 26 chromosomal abnormalities in an ATC cell
  line, 14.3 in 3 FTC cell line, and 3 in a PTC cell line. In conclusion, chromosomal
  abnormalities are frequent in ATCs associated with FTC, but uncommon in those associated
  with PTC and in ATCs with no associated differentiated thyroid cancer. These findings
  support the concept that PTC and FTC have different genetic backgrounds and, even
  after the transformation to ATC, they may retain some of their cytogenetic characteristics.
