abstract: A case of acute myeloid leukemia M2 with double minute chromosomes and complex
  karyotypic abnormalities was analyzed cytogenetically and molecularly. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH showed that the 8q24 region that contains the MYC oncogene
  was not amplified. Instead, amplification of chromosomal regions 11q23-- amp gt
  qter and 9p11-- amp gt pter was identified. Southern blot analysis confirmed the
  CGH findings and showed that the ETS1, FLI1, SRPR, NFRKB, and KCNJ5 genes located
  at 11q23-- amp gt 24 were amplified, whereas the MLL at 11q23 was not amplified.
  Additionally, the IFN beta 1 and CDKN2A genes at 9p were amplified, but to a lesser
  degree. This is the first example of a case of acute myeloid leukemia with double
  minute chromosomes that has not involved amplification of either the MYC or the
  MLL genes.
