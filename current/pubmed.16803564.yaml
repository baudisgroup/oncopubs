abstract: 'Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders PTLD are a major complication
  of solid organ transplantation, representing a cause of severe morbidity and mortality.
  Apart from Epstein-Barr virus infection, knowledge of the pathogenesis of monoclonal
  PTLD is limited. Powerful analysis techniques, such as whole genomic DNA profiling
  array comparative genomic hybridisation , can improve our understanding of PTLD
  pathogenesis. Whole genome profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping
  10 k 2.0 was performed on 20 PTLD cases and 25 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  DLBCL from immunocompetent patients as a control group. Recurrent lesions were detected
  among all the samples. Chromosome 18q, 7q, 3q and 12 were the most common gains
  in the control group. Chromosomes 5p and 11p were commonly gained in PTLD-DLBCL.
  The latter had frequent losses of 6q, 17p, 1p and 9p. Chromosome 12p was the most
  frequent target of deletions among PTLD-DLBCL cases. Loss of heterozygosity LOH
  did not always match DNA loss: chromosome 10 seemed to be targeted by uniparental
  disomy in PTLD. Small deletions and gains, involving both known BCL2 and PAX5 and
  unknown genes ZDHHC14 , were identified. These data suggest that PTLD share, at
  a lower frequency, common genetic aberrations with DLBCL from immunocompetent patients.
  The demonstration of 9p13 amplification emphasises the importance of PAX5 in PTLD.
  The combination of DNA copy number and LOH assessment lead to the hypothesis that
  uniparental disomy may be a potential mechanism in B-cell lymphomagenesis.'
