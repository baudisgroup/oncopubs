abstract: Follicle center lymphoma FCL is an indolent B cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma
  NHL characterized genetically by the t 14 18 translocation. Histological transformation
  and clinical progression of FCLs are frequently associated with secondary genetic
  alterations at both nucleic acid and chromosomal levels. To determine the type and
  pattern of genomic instability occurring in histological transformation of FCLs
  and the role of DNA mismatch repair defects in this procedure, we have performed
  microsatellite analysis, comparative genomic hybridization CGH and mutational analysis
  of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes on serial biopsy specimens from patients with FCL transformed
  to diffuse large cell lymphoma DLCL . Paired biopsy samples of eight patients were
  analyzed for microsatellite instability and structural alterations for hMLH1 and
  hMSH2 genes, and tumor samples of five patients were subjected to CGH analysis.
  A high level of microsatellite instability was associated with histological transformation
  of two cases of FCL, but no mutations of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes were detected
  in any of the lymphoma samples. In the five cases subjected to CGH analysis, the
  histological transformation of FCLs was associated with genomic imbalances at 21
  chromosomal regions. The genomic abnormalities found were rather heterogeneous and
  none of the genetic changes were overrepresented in the transformed DLCLs. These
  data suggest that histological transformation of FCLs to DLCL is frequently associated
  with genome wide instability at both nucleic acid and chromosomal levels, although
  mutations of the hMSH1 and hMLH2 genes are not involved in this process.
