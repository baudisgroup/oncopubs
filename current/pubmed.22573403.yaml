abstract: We have used whole exome sequencing to compare a group of presentation t
  4 14 with t 11 14 cases of myeloma to define the mutational landscape. Each case
  was characterized by a median of 24.5 exonic nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variations,
  and there was a consistently higher number of mutations in the t 4 14 group, but
  this number did not reach statistical significance. We show that the transition
  and transversion rates in the 2 subgroups are similar, suggesting that there was
  no specific mechanism leading to mutation differentiating the 2 groups. Only 3 of
  mutations were seen in both groups, and recurrently mutated genes include NRAS,
  KRAS, BRAF, and DIS3 as well as DNAH5, a member of the axonemal dynein family. The
  pattern of mutation in each group was distinct, with the t 4 14 group being characterized
  by deregulation of chromatin organization, actin filament, and microfilament movement.
  Recurrent RAS pathway mutations identified subclonal heterogeneity at a mutational
  level in both groups, with mutations being present as either dominant or minor subclones.
  The presence of subclonal diversity was confirmed at a single-cell level using other
  tumor-acquired mutations. These results are consistent with a distinct molecular
  pathogenesis underlying each subgroup and have important impacts on targeted treatment
  strategies. The Medical Research Council Myeloma IX trial is registered under ISRCTN68454111.
