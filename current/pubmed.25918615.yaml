abstract: 'Hidradenocarcinoma is a rare malignancy of the sweat glands with only a
  few cases reported in literature. The management of these tumors is based on the
  extent of disease with local disease managed with surgical resection. These can
  tumors carry a high potential of lymphatic and vascular spread and local and distant
  metastases are not uncommon. Given the rarity of the tumor and lack of genetic and
  clinical data about these tumors, there is no consensus on the proper management
  of metastatic disease. Here in we report the first case of metastatic hidradenocarcinoma
  with detailed molecular profiling including whole exome sequencing. We identified
  mutations in multiple genes including two that are potentially targetable: PTCH1
  and TCF7L1. Further work is necessary to not only confirm the presence of these
  mutations but also to confirm the clinical significance.'
