abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs are clonal stem cell disorders characterized
  by cytopenias, dysplasia in one or more cell lineages and ineffective hematopoiesis
  and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to bone marrow failure
  or evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are detected
  in 40-60 of patients. Multiple recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified
  by cytogenetics including fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH which is now widely
  recognized as one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic markers in MDS.
