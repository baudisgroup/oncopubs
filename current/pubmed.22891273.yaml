abstract: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma SMZL is a B cell malignancy of unknown pathogenesis,
  and thus an orphan of targeted therapies. By integrating whole-exome sequencing
  and copy-number analysis, we show that the SMZL exome carries at least 30 nonsilent
  gene alterations. Mutations in NOTCH2, a gene required for marginal-zone MZ B cell
  development, represent the most frequent lesion in SMZL, accounting for approximately
  20 of cases. All NOTCH2 mutations are predicted to cause impaired degradation of
  the NOTCH2 protein by eliminating the C-terminal PEST domain, which is required
  for proteasomal recruitment. Among indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorders,
  NOTCH2 mutations are restricted to SMZL, thus representing a potential diagnostic
  marker for this lymphoma type. In addition to NOTCH2, other modulators or members
  of the NOTCH pathway are recurrently targeted by genetic lesions in SMZL these include
  NOTCH1, SPEN, and DTX1. We also noted mutations in other signaling pathways normally
  involved in MZ B cell development, suggesting that deregulation of MZ B cell development
  pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of approximately 60 SMZL. These findings
  have direct implications for the treatment of SMZL patients, given the availability
  of drugs that can target NOTCH, NF-kappaB, and other pathways deregulated in this
  disease.
