abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
  with non-small-cell lung carcinomas in smokers being the predominant form of the
  disease. Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations
  in lung cancers, they have primarily focused on a limited set of genes and have
  thus provided a constrained view of the mutational spectrum. Recent cancer sequencing
  efforts have used next-generation sequencing technologies to provide a genome-wide
  view of mutations in leukaemia, breast cancer and cancer cell lines. Here we present
  the complete sequences of a primary lung tumour 60x coverage and adjacent normal
  tissue 46x . Comparing the two genomes, we identify a wide variety of somatic variations,
  including amp gt 50,000 high-confidence single nucleotide variants. We validated
  530 somatic single nucleotide variants in this tumour, including one in the KRAS
  proto-oncogene and 391 others in coding regions, as well as 43 large-scale structural
  variations. These constitute a large set of new somatic mutations and yield an estimated
  17.7 per megabase genome-wide somatic mutation rate. Notably, we observe a distinct
  pattern of selection against mutations within expressed genes compared to non-expressed
  genes and in promoter regions up to 5 kilobases upstream of all protein-coding genes.
  Furthermore, we observe a higher rate of amino acid-changing mutations in kinase
  genes. We present a comprehensive view of somatic alterations in a single lung tumour,
  and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of distinct selective pressures
  present within the tumour environment.
