abstract: The genetic mechanisms that define the malignant behaviour of small-cell
  lung cancer SCLC are poorly understood. We performed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH on 22 autoptic SCLCs to screen the tumour genome for genomic imbalances. DNA
  loss of chromosome 3p was a basic alteration that occurred in all tumours. Additionally,
  deletions were observed on chromosome 10q in 94 of tumours and on chromosomes 4q,
  5q, 13q and 17p in 86 of tumours. DNA loss was confirmed by loss of heterozygosity
  LOH analysis for chromosomes 3p, 5q and 10q. Simultaneous mutations of these six
  most abundant genetic changes were found in 12 cases. One single tumour carried
  at least five deletions. DNA under-representations were observed less frequently
  on chromosome 15q 55 and chromosome 16q 45 . The prevalent imbalances were clearly
  indicated by the superposition of the 22 tumours to a CGH superkaryogram. In our
  view, the high incidence of chromosomal loss is an indication that SCLC is defined
  by a pattern of deletions and that the inactivation of multiple growth-inhibitory
  pathways contributes in particular to the aggressive phenotype of that type of tumour.
