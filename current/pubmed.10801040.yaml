abstract: We have examined genetic alterations in 11 surgically removed oral squamous
  cell carcinomas OSCCs using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and laser scanning
  cytometry LSC , which allow quantitative analysis of chromosomal abnormalities.
  CGH analysis revealed gains and or losses of DNA sequence copy number in all tumors.
  Gains in DNA sequence copy number were detected frequently for chromosome arms 3q25-28
  6 11 , 5p 6 11 and 8q 5 11 , and losses in chromosome arms 18q 4 11 , 19q 4 11 ,
  17p 3 11 , and 19p 3 11 . Amplification of 5p was observed in two tumors. LSC detected
  DNA aneuploidy with DNA indices ranging from 1.30 to 1.82 in 6 of 11 tumors. The
  number of chromosomal aberrations was higher in DNA aneuploid tumors than in diploid
  tumors 8.17 vs 3.60 tumor, P amp lt 0.05 . Furthermore, the average number of chromosomal
  aberrations was significantly higher in stage T2 tumors and larger tumors than in
  stage T1 tumors 7.71 vs 3.25 tumor, P amp lt 0.05 . Our results suggest that DNA
  aneuploidy and large tumor size reflect an underlying chromosomal instability.
