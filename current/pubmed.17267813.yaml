abstract: High-density SNP microarrays provide insight into the genomic events that
  occur in diseases like cancer through their capability to measure both LOH and genomic
  copy numbers. Where currently available methods are restricted to the use of fresh
  frozen tissue, we now describe the design and validation of copy number measurements
  using the Illumina BeadArray platform and the application of this technique to formalin-fixed,
  paraffin-embedded FFPE tissue. In fresh frozen tissue from a set of colorectal tumors
  with numerous chromosomal aberrations, our method measures copy number patterns
  that are comparable to values from established platforms, like Affymetrix GeneChip
  and BAC array-CGH. Moreover, paired comparisons of fresh frozen and FFPE tissues
  showed nearly identical patterns of genomic change. We conclude that this method
  enables the use of paraffin-embedded material for research into both LOH and numerical
  chromosomal abnormalities. These findings make the large pathological archives available
  for genomic analysis, which could be especially relevant for hereditary disease
  where fresh material from affected relatives is rarely available.
