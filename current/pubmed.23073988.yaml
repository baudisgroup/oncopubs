abstract: Translocations affecting chromosome subband 6p25.3 containing the IRF4 gene
  have been recently described as characteristic alterations in a molecularly distinct
  subset of germinal center B-cell-derived lymphomas. Secondary changes have yet only
  been described in few of these lymphomas. Here, we performed array-comparative genomic
  hybridization and molecular inversion probe microarray analyses on DNA from 12 formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded and two fresh-frozen IRF4 translocation-positive lymphomas, which
  together with the previously published data on nine cases allowed the extension
  of copy number analyses to a total of 23 of these lymphomas. All except one case
  carried chromosomal imbalances, most frequently gains in Xq28, 11q22.3-qter, and
  7q32.1-qter and losses in 6q13-16.1, 15q14-22.31, and 17p. No recurrent copy-neutral
  losses of heterozygosity were observed. TP53 point mutations were detected in three
  of six cases with loss of 17p. Overall this study unravels a recurrent pattern of
  secondary genetic alterations in IRF4 translocation-positive lymphomas.
