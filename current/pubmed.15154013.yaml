abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers. Molecular events in the
  carcinogenesis of gastric cancer remain, however, largely undefined. We investigated
  changes in DNA copy number in 102 gastric cancers by CGH. We found changes in DNA
  copy number in all cases, with frequent amp gt or 30 of patients gains at 20q, 8q,
  20p, 7q, 17q, 5p, and 13q. Frequent amp gt or 20 losses were found at 19p, 18q,
  5q, 21q, 4p, 4q, 15q, and 17p. The mean number of total alterations was significantly
  lower in grade 3 and scirrhous-type carcinomas 10.81 in grade 3 vs 13.98 in grade
  1 and grade 2, 9.31 in scirrhous-type vs 13.18 in medullary- and intermediate-type
  . The mean number of losses and total alterations were higher in tumors at pT2,
  pT3 and pT4 4.68 and 12.77 in pT2, pT3, and pT4 vs 2.55 and 9.22 in pT1 . The mean
  number of losses was higher in carcinomas with lymph node metastasis 4.83 . The
  mean number of gains and total alterations were higher in carcinomas with venous
  invasion 8.44 and 13.28 . Several chromosomal alterations were linked in a statistically
  significant manner to specific clinicopathological parameters. Gain of 17q, 20p,
  and 20q and loss of 4p were associated with the pattern of the cancer-stroma relationship
  loss of 18q was associated with pT category gain of 5p was associated with pN category
  loss of 4q and loss of 21q were associated with lymphatic invasion gain of 7p and
  loss of 4q and 18q were associated with venous invasion and loss of 18q was associated
  with pathological stage. These data suggest that gain of 20q and loss of 18q might
  play an important role in the development and progression of gastric cancer. Moreover,
  some genes on 20q and 18q might be target genes of gastric cancer.
