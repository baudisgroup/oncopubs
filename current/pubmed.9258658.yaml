abstract: We have analyzed 30 cases of advanced-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma
  stages IIb-IV by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The most consistent chromosomal
  gain in the aneuploid tumors was mapped to chromosome arm 3q in 77 of the cases.
  Acquisition of genetic material also occurred frequently on Iq 47 , 5p 30 , 6p 27
  , and 20 23 . Recurrent losses were mapped on 2q 33 , 3p 50 , 4 33 , 8p 23 , and
  13q 27 . High-level copy number increases were mapped to chromosome 8, chromosome
  arms 3q, 5p, 8q, 12p, 14q, 17q, 19q, 20p, and 20q, and chromosomal bands 3q26-27,
  9p23-24, 11q22-23, and 12p13. In the majority of the cases, the presence of high-risk
  human papilloma virus genomes was detected. High proliferative activity was accompanied
  by crude aneuploidy. Increased p21 WAF-I activity, but low or undetectable expression
  of TP53 were representative for the immunophenotype. This study confirms the importance
  of a gain of chromosome arm 3q in cervical carcinogenesis and identifies additional,
  recurrent chromosomal aberrations that are required for progression from stage I
  tumors to advanced-stage carcinomas.
