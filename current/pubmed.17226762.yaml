abstract: 'To model the cytogenetic evolution in gastrointestinal stromal tumour GIST
  , an oncogenetic tree model was reconstructed using comparative genomic hybridization
  data from 203 primary GISTs 116 gastric and 87 intestinal GISTs, including 151 newly
  analysed cases , with follow-up available in 173 cases mean 40 months maximum 133
  months . The oncogenetic tree model identified three major cytogenetic pathways:
  one initiated by -14q, one by -1p, and another by -22q. The -14q pathway mainly
  characterized gastric tumours with predominantly stable karyotypes and more favourable
  clinical course. On the other hand, the -1p pathway was more characteristic of intestinal
  GISTs, with an increased capacity for cytogenetic complexity and more aggressive
  clinical course. Loss of 22q, more closely associated with -1p than -14q, appeared
  to initiate the critical transition to an unfavourable cytogenetic subpathway. This
  -22q pathway included accumulation of 8q, -9p, and -9q, which could all predict
  disease-free survival in addition to tumour site. Thus, insights into the cytogenetic
  evolution obtained from oncogenetic tree models may eventually help to gain a better
  understanding of the heterogeneous site-dependent biological behaviour of GISTs.'
