abstract: We report on a pediatric case of mixed phenotype acute leukemia with myeloid
  and T-lymphoid differentiation, a single myeloblastic cell population, and a monosomal
  complex karyotype. The patient, a 5-year-old girl, responded to acute myeloid leukemia-oriented
  therapy that was decided based on the morphological appearance of blast cells. In
  this study, we analyzed the patients peculiar chromosomal abnormalities, as evaluated
  by array comparative genomic hybridization in combination with multicolor fluorescence
  in situ hybridization and cytogenetic analyses.
