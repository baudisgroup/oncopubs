abstract: 'The genetic changes involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma are
  not completely understood. To investigate this matter, we studied paraffin-embedded,
  microdissected tissue of 47 ovarian epithelial tumors 9 adenomas, 11 tumors of low
  malignant potential LMP , 14 serous carcinomas, and 13 nonserous carcinomas using
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The primary data used in this study are
  available at our CGH online tumor database at http: amba.charite.de cgh. Chromosomal
  imbalances were found in 1 serous adenoma and in 7 LMP tumors. In the latter the
  alterations appeared randomly and showed no overlap with alterations found in invasive
  carcinomas. Although the mean aberration number of low-grade serous carcinomas was
  comparable to LMP tumors, the imbalances of the former occurred with high incidence
  amp gt 50 and were found at different localizations. High-grade serous carcinomas
  had more than twice as much chromosomal imbalances as low-grade serous carcinomas
  and also had pronounced alterations. In serous carcinomas, gains were found on 3q,
  6p, 7, 8q, and 20, and losses were found on 4q, 6q, 12q, 13q, and 16q. Comparing
  serous and nonserous carcinomas, the mean aberration number was comparable, but
  the number of high incidence changes was lower, and the most frequent imbalances
  were losses on 13q and gains on 20p. Overlapping alterations occurring in serous
  and nonserous carcinomas were gains on 3q and 6p, as well as losses on 4q. Chromosomal
  imbalances associated with poor prognosis of ovarian carcinomas were gains on 6p,
  7q, and 13q and losses on 15q, 17p, 18q, and 21q. Our data indicate that serous
  LMP tumors and invasive carcinomas have different genetic aberrations, indicating
  that invasive carcinomas do not arise from preexisting serous LMP tumors. On the
  other hand, there are common genetic abnormalities in serous and nonserous carcinomas,
  suggesting that they have very early lesions in common but take different paths
  of further development.'
