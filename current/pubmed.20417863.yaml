abstract: The prognosis of adult normal karyotype NK precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia B-ALL has not improved over the last decade, mainly because separation
  into distinct molecular subsets has been lacking and no targeted treatments are
  available. We screened the genome of blasts from 10 adult NK B-ALL patients for
  novel genomic alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization and verified
  our results with fluorescent in situ hybridization and gene expression profile with
  the same probes. The results demonstrate cryptic deletions of 9q34 involving SET,
  PKN3, NUP188, ABL1, and NUP214 in three of the samples. The smallest deletion resulted
  in the likely juxtaposition of the SET and NUP214 genes. This aberration has not
  been described before in adult NK B-ALL. Larger number of samples is warranted to
  determine the prognostic significance of this cryptic deletion.
