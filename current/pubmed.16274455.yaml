abstract: The aim of the present study was to identify genetic aberrations in a series
  of patients with cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma LBCL using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . Eighteen consecutive patients with primary 13 patients PCLBCL
  and secondary five patients SCLBCL cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma were included
  in the study. Nine cases corresponded to PCLBCL leg type and four cases primary
  cutaneous follicle centre-cell lymphoma PCFCL . Chromosomal imbalances CIs were
  detected in 14 of 18 samples 77.8 . All of nine cases with PCLBCL leg type and two
  of four cases with PCFCL showed CIs 100 and 50 , respectively . Regarding SCLBCL,
  in three of five cases 60 , CIs were detected. The most frequently detected gains
  involved 2q, 5q, 3 and 7q and amplifications affected 18, 12 and 13. Frequent losses
  were found in 17p. In PCLBCL leg type, the most frequent gains involved 2q and 7q,
  amplifications were localized in chromosomes 12, 13 and 18 and losses affected chromosomes
  17p and 19. In PCFCL, gains located in 3q, 4 and 7q were found. Our study seems
  to confirm clear-cut differences between primary cutaneous LBCL and nodal diffuse
  LBCL, and it suggests the presence of genotypic differences between cases of PCLBCL
  leg type and cases of PCFCL.
