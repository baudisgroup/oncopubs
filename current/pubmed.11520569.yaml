abstract: Angiosarcoma of the head and neck most commonly involves the skin of the
  scalp or face; primary involvement of the sinonasal region is exceedingly rate.
  We report a patient with sinonasal angiosarcoma who showed marrow involvement at
  presentation. Marrow aspiration smears showed many large, often segregated blast-like
  cells, mimicking malignant lymphoma. However, trephine biopsy revealed formation
  of anastomosing vascular spaces by the tumor cells and immunoreactivity for CD31,
  supporting a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. DNA ploidy analysis showed an apparent diploidy.
  Nevertheless, conventional cytogenetics demonstrated very complex chromosomal abnormalities
  with the presence of multiple hypodiploid clones, together with several near-triploid
  to near-tetraploid clones showing structural abnormalities involving chromosomes
  1, 3, 4, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 22. The identification of these karyotypic changes
  has been facilitated by the application of comparative genomic hybridization and
  spectral karyotyping.
