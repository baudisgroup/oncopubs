abstract: Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis
  and or progression of ovarian cancer OC . To investigate the genomic imbalances
  and identify the cancer-related genes associated with this tumor, we applied comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH in OC cell lines.
