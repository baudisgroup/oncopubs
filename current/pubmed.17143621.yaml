abstract: DNA copy number changes represent molecular fingerprints of solid tumors
  and are as such relevant for better understanding of tumor development and progression.
  In this study, we applied genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH
  to identify gene-specific DNA copy number changes in chromosomal CIN - and microsatellite
  MIN -unstable sporadic colorectal cancers sCRC . Genomic DNA was extracted from
  microdissected, matching normal colorectal epithelium and invasive tumor cells of
  formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues of 22 cases with colorectal cancer
  CIN 11, MIN 11 . DNA copy number changes were determined by aCGH for 287 target
  sequences in tumor cell DNAs, using pooled normal DNAs as reference. aCGH data of
  tumor cell DNAs was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH for three
  genes on serial tissues as those used for aCGH. aCGH revealed DNA copy number changes
  previously described by metaphase CGH gains 7, 8q, 13q, and 20q losses 8p, 15q,
  18q, and 17p . However, chromosomal regions 20q, 13q, 7, and 17p were preferentially
  altered in CIN-type tumors and included DNA amplifications of eight genes on chromosome
  20q TOP1, AIB1, MYBL2, CAS, PTPN1, STK15, ZNF217, and CYP24 , two genes on chromosome
  13q BRCA2 and D13S25 , and three genes on chromosome 7 IL6, CYLN2, and MET as well
  as DNA deletions of two genes on chromosome 17p HIC1 and LLGL1 . Finally, additional
  CIN-tumor-associated DNA amplifications were identified for EXT1 8q24.11 and MYC
  8q24.12 as well as DNA deletions for MAP2K5 15q23 and LAMA3 18q11.2 . In contrast,
  distinct MIN-tumor-associated DNA amplifications were detected for E2F5 8p22-q21.3
  , GARP 11q13.5-q14 , ATM 11q22.3 , KAL Xp22.3 , and XIST Xq13.2 as well as DNA deletions
  for RAF1 3p25 , DCC 18q21.3 , and KEN 21q tel . aCGH revealed distinct DNA copy
  number changes of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in CIN- and MIN-type sporadic
  colorectal carcinomas. The identified candidate genes are likely to have distinct
  functional roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of CIN- and MIN-type sporadic
  CRCs and may be involved in the differential response of CIN- and MIN-type tumor
  cells to adjuvant therapy, such as 5-fluorouracil.
