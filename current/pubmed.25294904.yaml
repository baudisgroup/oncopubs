abstract: CD8(+) T lymphocytes can kill autologous melanoma cells, but their activity
  is impaired when poorly immunogenic tumor phenotypes evolve in the course of disease
  progression. Here, we analyzed three consecutive melanoma lesions obtained within
  one year of developing stage IV disease for their recognition by autologous T cells.One
  skin (Ma-Mel-48a) and two lymph node (Ma-Mel-48b, Ma-Mel-48c) metastases were analyzed
  for T-cell infiltration. Melanoma cell lines established from the respective lesions
  were characterized, determining the T-cell-stimulatory capacity, expression of surface
  molecules involved in T-cell activation, and specific genetic alterations affecting
  the tumor-T-cell interaction.Metastases Ma-Mel-48a and Ma-Mel-48b, in contrast with
  Ma-Mel-48c, were infiltrated by T cells. The T-cell-stimulatory capacity was found
  to be strong for Ma-Mel-48a, lower for Ma-Mel-48b, and completely abrogated for
  Ma-Mel-48c cells. The latter proved to be HLA class I-negative due to an inactivating
  mutation in one allele of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene and concomitant loss
  of the other allele by a deletion on chromosome 15q. The same deletion was already
  present in Ma-Mel-48a and Ma-Mel-48b cells, pointing to an early acquired genetic
  event predisposing to development of Î²2m deficiency. Notably, the same chronology
  of genetic alterations was also observed in a second Î²2m-deficient melanoma model.Our
  study reveals a progressive loss in melanoma immunogenicity during the course of
  metastatic disease. The genetic evolvement of T-cell resistance suggests screening
  tumors for genetic alterations affecting immunogenicity could be clinically relevant
  in terms of predicting patient responses to T-cell-based immunotherapy.
