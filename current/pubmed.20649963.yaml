abstract: We present a computational method, TuMult, for reconstructing the sequence
  of copy number changes driving carcinogenesis, based on the analysis of several
  tumor samples from the same patient. We demonstrate the reliability of the method
  with simulated data, and describe applications to three different cancers, showing
  that TuMult is a valuable tool for the establishment of clonal relationships between
  tumor samples and the identification of chromosome aberrations occurring at crucial
  steps in cancer progression.
