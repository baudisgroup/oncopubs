abstract: Metaplastic thymoma is a rare primary thymic epithelial tumor, and its biologic
  behavior is uncertain. We report 7 cases of metaplastic thymoma. The spindle components
  of the tumor seemed to be undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is
  characterized by the loss of E-cadherin expression. Epstein-Barr virus seemed not
  to have an etiologic role in metaplastic thymoma. No gross genetic alterations were
  found by using comparative genomic hybridization. The patients were alive and well
  in follow-up ranging from 11 to 172 months mean, 81.7 months . The findings suggest
  that metaplastic thymoma has a benign clinical course. Unless the histomorphologic
  findings show malignant features, surgical excision alone is recommended.
