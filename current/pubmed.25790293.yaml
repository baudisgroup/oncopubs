abstract: There is incomplete understanding of genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution
  during cancer progression. Here we use deep whole-exome sequencing to describe the
  clonal architecture and evolution of 20 pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias
  from diagnosis to relapse. We show that clonal diversity is comparable at diagnosis
  and relapse and clonal survival from diagnosis to relapse is not associated with
  mutation burden. Six pathways were frequently mutated, with NT5C2, CREBBP, WHSC1,
  TP53, USH2A, NRAS and IKZF1 mutations enriched at relapse. Half of the leukaemias
  had multiple subclonal mutations in a pathway or gene at diagnosis, but mostly with
  only one, usually minor clone, surviving therapy to acquire additional mutations
  and become the relapse founder clone. Relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 were found
  in nine cases, with mutations in four cases being in descendants of the relapse
  founder clone. These results provide important insights into the genetic basis of
  treatment failure in ALL and have implications for the early detection of mutations
  driving relapse.
