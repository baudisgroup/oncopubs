abstract: Conventional cytogenetics has led to the identification of the primary t
  11 22 q24 q12 translocation in the Ewings family of tumours, and to the demonstration
  of certain recurring secondary aberrations that may contribute to neoplastic progression.
  Other important cytogenetic abnormalities may previously have been overlooked due
  to the limited resolution of chromosome banding. Here, we have applied the molecular
  cytogenetic techniques of spectral karyotyping, multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridisation
  and comparative genomic hybridisation to the characterisation of seven Ewings tumour
  cell lines and one primary culture. These complementary techniques have enabled
  us to produce a detailed description of the karyotypes of the cell lines and to
  demonstrate recurring numerical and structural abnormalities. In particular, we
  have identified a novel, unbalanced translocation involving chromosomes 16 and 17
  in three of eight samples, including the primary culture. The unbalanced translocation
  was associated with comparative genomic hybridisation evidence of loss of 16q and
  17p, copy number imbalances that were seen in five and four of the eight samples
  respectively. Recurrent breakpoints at 16p11.2, 16q11.1, 17p11.2 and 17q11.2 were
  identified. Our findings indicate that chromosomes 16 and 17 should be investigated
  further in the search for genes involved in the development of Ewings family tumours.
