abstract: 'Twenty-six gastric carcinoma and matching normal tissue DNAs, which had
  previously been analyzed for alterations of the APC adenomatous polyposis coli and
  MCC mutated in colorectal cancer genes were further investigated for the following
  genetic alterations: mutation and loss of heterozygosity LOH of the p53 gene, replication
  error RER and LOH at 12 microsatellite repeat loci, and mutation of the hMSH2 gene.
  In addition, 9 of the 26 gastric carcinomas were analyzed for genetic alterations
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Somatic mutations of the p53 gene
  were found to be frequent being detected in 31 of gastric carcinomas while LOH at
  the p53 locus was observed in 37.5 of informative cases. Loss of wild type p53 allele
  was detected in the majority 7 of 8 tumors found to be harboring a mutation. In
  the hMSH2 gene, an intronic 4 base pair insertion at 31 base pairs upstream of the
  beginning of exon 13 was detected in both tumor and normal tissue from one gastric
  carcinoma case. RER was detected in 11.5 of gastric carcinomas, at one or more microsatellite
  repeat loci. Of the 12 microsatellite repeat loci analyzed LOH was most frequently
  observed at D22S351 30 informative cases suggesting that a tumor suppressor gene
  on 22q may be important in gastric carcinogenesis. In support of this, CGH analysis
  carried out on 9 of the gastric carcinomas identified loss of chromosome 22 in 5
  of these tumors.'
