abstract: Ewing sarcoma peripheral primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor PNET is a round-cell
  sarcoma that may show varying degrees of neuro-ectodermal differentiation. These
  tumors are identified by a characteristic round-cell morphology and immunohistochemical
  profile, as well as by specific translocations involving the EWS gene on chromosome
  22 and the 3 portion of the E26 transformation-specific family of transcription
  factors. These translocations result in fusion proteins that act as aberrant transcription
  factors. The majority of Ewing sarcoma cases are characterized by a balanced t 11
  22 . Specific chromosomal abnormalities often correlate with distinct morphologic
  or phenotypic subtypes of tumors and play an important role in prognosis. Here we
  describe the molecular cytogenetic investigation of a case of Ewing sarcoma in the
  proximal humerus of a 39-year-old male using COBRA combined binary ratio labelling
  fluorescent in situ hybridization karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization,
  and EWS-gene specific fluorescence in situ hybridization. Multiple chromosomal aberrations
  were identified, including a der 22 r 20 22 , resulting in an amplification of the
  proximal region of the EWS gene. This is the first time that both translocation
  and amplification involving the EWS gene and an unidentified gene are described.
  This case adds to the spectrum of both morphology and genetic rearrangements in
  Ewing sarcoma, and shows the importance of combined molecular cytogenetic approaches
  in identifying uncommon rearrangements in sarcomas.
