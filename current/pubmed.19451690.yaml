abstract: Somatic genetic alterations in cancers have been linked with response to
  targeted therapeutics by creation of specific dependency on activated oncogenic
  signaling pathways. However, no tools currently exist to systematically connect
  such genetic lesions to therapeutic vulnerability. We have therefore developed a
  genomics approach to identify lesions associated with therapeutically relevant oncogene
  dependency. Using integrated genomic profiling, we have demonstrated that the genomes
  of a large panel of human non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC cell lines are highly
  representative of those of primary NSCLC tumors. Using cell-based compound screening
  coupled with diverse computational approaches to integrate orthogonal genomic and
  biochemical data sets, we identified molecular and genomic predictors of therapeutic
  response to clinically relevant compounds. Using this approach, we showed that v-Ki-ras2
  Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog KRAS mutations confer enhanced Hsp90
  dependency and validated this finding in mice with KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma,
  as these mice exhibited dramatic tumor regression when treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor.
  In addition, we found that cells with copy number enhancement of v-abl Abelson murine
  leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 ABL2 and ephrin receptor kinase and v-src sarcoma
  Schmidt-Ruppin A-2 viral oncogene homolog avian SRC kinase family genes were exquisitely
  sensitive to treatment with the SRC ABL inhibitor dasatinib, both in vitro and when
  it xenografted into mice. Thus, genomically annotated cell-line collections may
  help translate cancer genomics information into clinical practice by defining critical
  pathway dependencies amenable to therapeutic inhibition.
