abstract: Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney CCSK is a rare malignant pediatric tumor,
  distinguished from the Wilms tumor by its characteristic histologic features and
  a more aggressive clinical behavior with a tendency to metastasize to bone. Genetic
  studies on CCSK are limited and no consistent findings have been reported.
