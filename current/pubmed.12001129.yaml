abstract: Placental site trophoblastic tumor PSTT is a rare form of gestational trophoblastic
  neoplasm composed predominantly of intermediate trophoblast. Most showed benign
  behavior whereas 10-15 of PSTTs were clinically malignant with later recurrence
  and metastasis. Currently, there are no reliable means to predict clinical outcome,
  and cytogenetic information is scanty.
