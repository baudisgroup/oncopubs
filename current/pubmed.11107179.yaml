abstract: To characterize phenotypic and genotypic changes in gastric cancer GC ,
  DNA copy number aberrations CNAs were assessed in 53 tumors using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics and status
  of TP53 and replication error RER . The number of CNAs per tumor was 6.8 gain 5.3,
  loss 1.5 , and the number of changes was significantly higher in tumors with advanced
  stage, TP53 mutation, and without RER than in those with early stage 7.7 vs. 3.0
  , no TP53 mutations 12.4 vs. 4.8 or RER phenotype 8.2 vs. 2.6 . Frequent abnormalities
  included gains on chromosomal arms 8q 43 , 6q 26 , 11q 26 , 13q 24 , 7p 23 , 17q
  23 , and 20q 23 , and losses on chromosomal arms 16q 26 , 19p 23 , 5q 19 , 3p 15
  , 4q 15 , and 1p 15 . Advanced GC demonstrated a higher prevalence of gains of 8q
  51 vs. 10 , P amp lt 0.05 and loss of 16q 33 vs. 0 , P amp lt 0.05 than early GC.
  Gains on 8q 64 vs. 20 , P amp lt 0.05 , 17q 39 vs. 4 , P amp lt 0.05 and losses
  on 3p 25 vs. 4 , P 0.05 and 5q 32 vs. 4 , P amp lt 0.05 were higher in intestinal
  GC than in diffuse GC. On the other hand, gains on 13q were more common in the diffuse
  type 40 vs. 11 , P amp lt 0.05 . As compared with noncardia cancer, cardia cancer
  showed more gains on 7p 58 vs. 12 , P amp lt 0.05 and 20q 58 vs. 12 , P amp lt 0.05
  and more losses on 4q 50 vs. 5 , P amp lt 0.05 . The finding of histology-related
  aberrations and the combination of CGH and molecular data thus provide additional
  evidence suggesting genetic heterogeneity of GC.
