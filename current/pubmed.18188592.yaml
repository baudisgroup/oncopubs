abstract: Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary comprise 8 of all ovarian neoplasms.
  Because they consist of cells that resemble embryonic sex cord and or specialized
  ovarian stroma cells, their cytologic and histologic features can be viewed as reflecting
  a continuum from fibromas to thecomas with thecofibromas in between. Existing cytogenetic
  knowledge about ovarian thecomas-thecofibromas-fibromas is restricted to 44 cases
  with chromosomal abnormalities. The most common aberration has been trisomy 12,
  identified either by karyotyping or using fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  . We wanted to obtain more information about the genomic composition of these tumors,
  and, therefore, examined 29 new thecoma-thecofibroma-fibroma tumors of the ovary
  using karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, interphase FISH, and DNA ploidy
  analysis. We detected aneuploidy in 21 tumors. Trisomy and or tetrasomy 12 was the
  most common chromosomal aberration, found in 15 tumors 71.5 of the aneuploid tumors
  or 51.5 of all analyzed tumors , followed by trisomy for chromosomes 10, 18, 4,
  and 9. Some monosomies for chromosomes 4, 9, 10, and 18 were also identified, either
  as the sole change or in combination with trisomies. The nonrandom occurrence of
  these aneuploidies in these benign tumors strongly indicates that they play a major
  pathogenetic role, but how trisomies and other aneuploidies contribute to tumorigenesis
  remains unknown.
