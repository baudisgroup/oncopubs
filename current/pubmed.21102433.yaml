abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most aggressive of human cancers. A key
  feature of GBMs is the extensive network of abnormal vasculature characterized by
  glomeruloid structures and endothelial hyperplasia. Yet the mechanisms of angiogenesis
  and the origin of tumour endothelial cells remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate
  that a subpopulation of endothelial cells within glioblastomas harbour the same
  somatic mutations identified within tumour cells, such as amplification of EGFR
  and chromosome 7. We additionally demonstrate that the stem-cell-like CD133(+) fraction
  includes a subset of vascular endothelial-cadherin (CD144)-expressing cells that
  show characteristics of endothelial progenitors capable of maturation into endothelial
  cells. Extensive in vitro and in vivo lineage analyses, including single cell clonal
  studies, further show that a subpopulation of the CD133(+) stem-like cell fraction
  is multipotent and capable of differentiation along tumour and endothelial lineages,
  possibly via an intermediate CD133(+)/CD144(+) progenitor cell. The findings are
  supported by genetic studies of specific exons selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas,
  quantitative FISH and comparative genomic hybridization data that demonstrate identical
  genomic profiles in the CD133(+) tumour cells, their endothelial progenitor derivatives
  and mature endothelium. Exposure to the clinical anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab
  or to a Î³-secretase inhibitor as well as knockdown shRNA studies demonstrate that
  blocking VEGF or silencing VEGFR2 inhibits the maturation of tumour endothelial
  progenitors into endothelium but not the differentiation of CD133(+) cells into
  endothelial progenitors, whereas Î³-secretase inhibition or NOTCH1 silencing blocks
  the transition into endothelial progenitors. These data may provide new perspectives
  on the mechanisms of failure of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors currently in use. The
  lineage plasticity and capacity to generate tumour vasculature of the putative cancer
  stem cells within glioblastoma are novel findings that provide new insight into
  the biology of gliomas and the definition of cancer stemness, as well as the mechanisms
  of tumour neo-angiogenesis.
