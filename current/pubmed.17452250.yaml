abstract: Large-scale hemizygous loss of chromosome 3p is a common event in neuroblastoma,
  occurring preferentially in tumors that exhibit loss of chromosome 11q and lack
  MYCN amplification. Although numerous tumor suppressor genes TSG have been mapped
  to the 3p region, the gene or genes contributing to neuroblastoma pathogenesis have
  remained elusive. High-resolution oligonucleotide array CGH mapping of chromosome
  3p breakpoints relative to the positions of known TSGs indicates that more than
  one gene may contribute to neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We evaluated the methylation
  status of semaphorin 3B SEMA3B , one of the chromosome 3p TSGs, in neuroblastoma
  tumors with n 12 and without n 32 3p deletions. A significantly higher percentage
  of methylated CpG sites in the SEMA3B promoter was detected in tumors exhibiting
  3p loss 95 , relative to tumors without loss 52 , suggestive of a two-hit mechanism
  of allele inactivation. The involvement of methylation in the control of SEMA3B
  expression was confirmed by treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with the demethylating
  agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Transcriptional regulation of this locus is complex,
  however low levels of SEMA3B expression were also seen in tumors with unmethylated
  SEMA3B promoters n 4 . SEMA3B is known to play an important role in the development
  of normal sympathetic neurons, and interestingly, we found higher levels of SEMA3B
  expression in differentiated tumors with favorable histopathology n 19 than in tumors
  with unfavorable histology n 22 . Furthermore, SEMA3B was upregulated in the SK-N-BE
  neuroblastoma cell line following induction of differentiation with retinoic acid.
  The association of SEMA3B expression with neuroblastoma differentiation suggests
  that this TSG may play a role in neuroblastoma pathobiology.
