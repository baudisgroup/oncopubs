abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous neoplasm among
  American males and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Prostate
  specific antigen screening has resulted in earlier disease detection, yet approximately
  30 of men will die of metastatic disease. Slow disease progression, an aging population
  and associated morbidity and mortality underscore the need for improved disease
  classification and therapies. To address these issues, we analyzed a cohort of patients
  using array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . The cohort comprises 64 patients,
  half of whom recurred postoperatively. Analysis of the aCGH profiles revealed numerous
  recurrent genomic copy number aberrations. Specific loss at 8p23.2 was associated
  with advanced stage disease, and gain at 11q13.1 was found to be predictive of postoperative
  recurrence independent of stage and grade. Moreover, comparison with an independent
  set of metastases revealed approximately 40 candidate markers associated with metastatic
  potential. Copy number aberrations at these loci may define metastatic genotypes.
