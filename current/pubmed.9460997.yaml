abstract: The differential diagnosis of mesothelioma, primary adenocarcinomas and
  pleural metastases frequently causes problems. We have used the comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH technique on 34 malignant mesotheliomas and 30 primary lung carcinomas
  adenocarcinoma, including bronchoalveolar carcinoma and large-cell anaplastic carcinoma
  to compare their copy number changes and to evaluate the use of CGH to distinguish
  between these two types of tumour. In mesothelioma, gains of genetic material occurred
  as frequently as losses, whereas gains predominated over losses in carcinoma. In
  mesothelioma, the most frequent changes were losses in 4q, 6q and 14q and gains
  in 15q and 7p, whereas gains in 8q, 1q, 7p, 5p and 6p were the most common changes
  in carcinoma. Amplification of KRAS2 was detected in two adenocarcinomas by Southern
  blot analysis. CGH showed gains in 12p in the same tumours. Statistically significant
  differences between the two types of tumour were detected in chromosomes X, 1, 2p,
  4, 8q, 10q, 12p, 14q, 15q and 18q. When comparing the frequency of gains and losses
  between mesothelioma and lung carcinoma using discriminant analysis, the sensitivity
  of CGH to differentiate mesotheliomas from lung carcinomas was 81 and the specificity
  77 . The differences in DNA copy number changes between the two types of tumour
  suggest that they are genetically different tumour entities. Although CGH cannot
  be used as a definitive discriminatory method, we were able to distinguish between
  mesothelioma and lung carcinoma in a large proportion of the abnormal cases.
