abstract: Although it is well-known that cancers show intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity,
  genotypic studies have been scarce. Using comparative genomic hybridization and
  laser scanning cytometric analyses, we investigated intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity
  in 21 surgically removed gliomas including 11 glioblastomas GBMs , 8 anaplastic
  astrocytomas AAs and 2 low-grade astrocytomas. Comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis revealed gain or amplification of 7p in 63 , gain of 7q in 73 , loss of
  9p in 53 , loss of 10p in 47 , loss of 10q in 47 , loss of 13q in 53 , and loss
  of 22q in 37 of high-grade astrocytomas. Because these aberrations were region-independent
  within the same tumor, they did not contribute to intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity.
  Such heterogeneity was due to cytogenetic changes other than the above region-independent
  aberrations. Intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity was detected in 8 of 11 GBMs,
  4 of 8 AAs, and none of the 2 low-grade astrocytomas. These observations suggest
  that cytogenetic changes at chromosomes 7, 9p, 10, 13, and 22 are primary events
  in high-grade astrocytomas and that subsequent cytogenetic changes involving increases
  in copy number provide intratumoral heterogeneity. DNA aneuploidy was detected by
  laser scanning cytometry in 5 of 11 GBMs and 1 of 8 AAs. All tumors with DNA aneuploidy
  exhibited intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity, and there was a significant correlation
  between DNA aneuploidy and intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity. These results
  support the notion that cytogenetic heterogeneity results from genetic instability
  within a tumor.
