abstract: Forty-four samples from 25 cases of retroperitoneal sarcoma initially diagnosed
  as malignant fibrous histiocytoma were histologically reviewed. Immunohistochemistry
  for mdm2 and cdk4 was performed on 20 cases. Comparative genomic hybridization was
  performed on 18 samples from 13 patients. Seventeen cases were reclassified as dedifferentiated
  liposarcoma. Twenty-one of 32 samples from these patients showed areas of well-differentiated
  liposarcoma, allowing the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemistry
  performed in 15 of these cases showed positivity for mdm2 and cdk4. Comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis performed on 15 samples from 11 of these patients
  showed an amplification of the 12q13-15 region. Eight cases were reclassified as
  poorly differentiated sarcoma. Twelve samples from these patients showed no area
  of well-differentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for mdm2
  and cdk4 in one of six of these patients and showed positivity for CD34 in another
  one. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis performed on three samples from
  two of these patients showed no amplification of the 12q13-15 region but showed
  complex profiles. This study shows that most so-called malignant fibrous histiocytomas
  developed in the retroperitoneum are dedifferentiated liposarcoma and that a poorly
  differentiated sarcoma in this area should prompt extensive sampling to demonstrate
  a well-differentiated liposarcoma component, immunohistochemistry for mdm2 and cdk4,
  and if possible, a cytogenetic or a molecular biology analysis.
