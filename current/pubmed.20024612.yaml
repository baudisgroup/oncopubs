abstract: Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 FGFR-1 is amplified in 10 of human breast
  cancers. The goal of this study was to test the correlation between FGFR-1 amplification
  and expression and sensitivity to brivanib, an FGFR-1 small molecule inhibitor,
  in breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Using CGH array and gene expression profiling,
  FGFR-1 DNA copy number, mRNA, and protein expression were measured in 21 cell lines
  and correlated with growth inhibition by brivanib. We examined FGFR-1 autophosphorylation
  and kinase activity, as well as phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules
  in response to bFGF and brivanib exposure. CAMA, MDA-MB-361, and HCC38 cells had
  FGFR-1 amplification and protein overexpression. Brivanib GI 50 values were significantly
  lower in the gene amplified 15.17 M, n 3 compared to normal copy number 69.09 M,
  n 11 or FGFR-1 deleted 76.14 M, n 7 cells P 0.0107 . Among nonamplified cells, there
  was no correlation between FGFR-1 mRNA or protein expression levels and brivanib
  sensitivity. Two of three FGFR-1 amplified cells were sensitive to bFGF-induced
  growth stimulation, which was blocked by brivanib. In cells with amplified FGFR-1,
  brivanib decreased receptor autophosphorylation, inhibited bFGF-induced tyrosine
  kinase activity, and reduced phosphorylation of ERK and AKT. Breast cancer cell
  lines with FGFR-1 gene amplification and protein overexpression are more sensitive
  to growth inhibition by brivanib than nonamplified cells. These findings suggest
  that FGFR-1 amplification or protein overexpression in breast cancers may be an
  indicator for brivanib treatment, where it may have direct anti-proliferative effects
  in addition to its anti-angiogenic effects.
