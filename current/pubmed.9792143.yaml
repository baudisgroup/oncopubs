abstract: DNA copy number changes were compared in 29 histologically benign follicular
  adenomas, of which five were atypical, and 13 follicular carcinomas of the thyroid
  by comparative genomic hybridization. DNA copy number changes were frequent in adenomas
  14 out of 29, 48 . Most changes were gains, and they always involved a gain of the
  entire chromosome 7 10 out of 29, 34 other common gains involved chromosomes 5 28
  , 9 10 , 12 24 , 14 21 , 17 17 , 18 14 and X 17 . Losses were found only in four
  14 adenomas. Two of the five atypical adenomas had DNA copy number losses, and none
  had gains. Unlike adenomas, gains were rare and losses were frequent in carcinomas.
  A loss of chromosome 22 or 22q was particularly common in carcinomas 6 out of 13,
  46 , whereas a loss of chromosome 22 was found in only two 7 adenomas, one of which
  was atypical P 0.002 . A loss of 1p was also frequent in carcinomas 31 , but gains
  of chromosomes 5, 7, 12, 14 or X that were common in adenomas were not found. Loss
  of chromosome 22 or 22q was present in six of the eight widely invasive follicular
  carcinomas, but in only one of the five minimally invasive carcinomas. We conclude
  that large DNA copy number changes are common in thyroid adenomas. These changes
  are strikingly different from those found in follicular carcinomas consisting of
  few losses and frequent gains, especially those of chromosome 7. A loss of chromosome
  22 is common in widely invasive follicular carcinoma.
