abstract: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-CLL results from the accumulation
  of monoclonal CD5 B cells. Despite its homogeneity at cellular level, B-CLL is clinically
  heterogeneous. Clinical studies indicate that CD38 B-CLL are characterized by a
  more aggressive clinical course than are CD38- B-CLL. On the basis of these studies
  and considering the established correlation between specific chromosome aberrations
  and the clinical course of B-CLL, it is possible that CD38 B-CLL cases are also
  characterized by specific subsets of chromosomal alterations.
