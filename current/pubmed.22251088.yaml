abstract: Multistep pathways and mechanisms are involved in the development of oral
  cancer. Chromosomal alterations are one of such key mechanisms implicated oral carcinogenesis.
  Therefore, this study aims to determine the genomic copy number alterations CNAs
  in oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC using array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH and in addition attempt to correlate CNAs with modified gene expression.
