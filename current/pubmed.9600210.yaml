abstract: AWe report on two siblings brother and sister who developed cerebral PNETs
  at the age of 5 years and 6 months, respectively. Both children were treated by
  operation followed by polychemotherapy. The brother also received cranio-spinal
  irradiation. Nevertheless, the children died about 12 months and 24 months post-operatively
  due to extensive cerebral tumor recurrences. Shortly after having lost both of her
  children, the mother developed an intra-abdominal tumor, which was resected and
  histologically diagnosed as ovarian carcinoma. Because of this unusual familial
  clustering of tumors and a positive history of brain tumors and other cancers in
  several maternal relatives, we analyzed DNA isolated from both PNETs and the ovarian
  carcinoma as well as constitutional leukocyte DNA from the whole family for mutation
  of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. This analysis revealed that all tumors were homozygous
  for a missense mutation at codon 213 CGA amp gt TGG resulting in an amino acid exchange
  from arginine to tryptophane. The same mutation was present in one TP53 allele in
  the constitutional DNA of the mother and the children, indicating that the mother
  had transmitted a TP53 germline mutation to both of her children. Analysis of loss
  of heterozygosity at microsatellite markers from 17p confirmed deletion of the paternal
  wild-type allele in both PNETs. Further investigation of the PNETs by comparative
  genomic hybridization revealed multiple chromosomal abnormalities. Interestingly,
  some genomic changes were common to both PNETs, while many others were not, a finding
  suggesting substantial genomic instability, probably as a consequence of p53 inactivation.
