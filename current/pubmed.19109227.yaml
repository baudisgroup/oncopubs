abstract: 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia APL is a hematopoietic malignant disease characterized
  by the chromosomal translocation t 15 17 , resulting in the formation of the PML-RARA
  gene. Here, 47 t 15 17 APL samples were analyzed with high-density single-nucleotide
  polymorphism microarray 50-K and 250-K SNP-chips using the new algorithm AsCNAR
  allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references . Copy-number-neutral
  loss of heterozygosity CNN-LOH was identified at chromosomes 10q 3 cases , 11p 3
  cases , and 19q 1 case . Twenty-eight samples 60 did not have an obvious alteration
  normal-copy-number NC group . Nineteen samples 40 showed either one or more genomic
  abnormalities: 8 samples 17 had trisomy 8 either with or without an additional duplication,
  deletion, or CNN-LOH 8 group and 11 samples 23 had genomic abnormalities without
  trisomy 8 other abnormalities group . These chromosomal abnormalities were acquired
  somatic mutations. Interestingly, FLT3-ITD mutations 11 47 cases occurred only in
  the group with no genomic alteration NC group . Taken together, these results suggest
  that the pathway of development of APL differs in each group: FLT3-ITD, trisomy
  8, and other genomic changes. Here, we showed for the first time hidden abnormalities
  and novel disease-related genomic changes in t 15 17 APL.'
