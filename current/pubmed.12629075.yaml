abstract: 'The mechanisms of adrenocortical tumorigenesis are still not fully understood.
  Data from clonal analysis, comparative genomic hybridization, and allelotyping suggest
  that it involves a multistep process during which several genetic defects are progressively
  acquired, leading to the malignant transformation. The events involved in the first
  steps of this process are not well known, and most of the abnormalities described
  in adrenocortical tumors to date are associated with the malignant phenotype. We
  report a case that suggests that adrenocortical tumorigenesis may be a multistep
  process. A 43-yr-old patient underwent surgery for an incidentally discovered adrenal
  mass. Pathological analysis showed that this tumor consisted of two parts: a central
  part with features of malignancy surrounded by another part with a strictly benign
  appearance. These data were confirmed by molecular analysis and comparative genomic
  hybridization that were consistent with either a malignant or benign presentation.
  The apparently malignant part of the tumor exhibited molecular abnormalities 17p13
  loss of heterozygosity LOH , 11p15 uniparental disomy and overexpression of the
  IGF-II gene as well as chromosomal gains and losses comparative genomic hybridization
  that have been previously described in malignant tumors. No abnormalities were found
  in the surrounding benign tissues. Although this observation is not definitive proof
  that adrenocortical tumorigenesis occurs via a multistep process, it suggests that
  there is a progressive change from the benign to the malignant state in some adrenocortical
  tumors.'
