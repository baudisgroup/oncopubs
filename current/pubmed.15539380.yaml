abstract: A number of genetic abnormalities have been detected in multiple myeloma
  MM using cytogenetic techniques. The prominent abnormalities are deletions of 13q
  and translocations affecting the IgH locus on 14q32. The recurrence of chromosomal
  abnormalities in MM suggests a specific role for them concerning its pathogenesis.
  We performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH on samples from 53 patients with
  MM and 4 with monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance. In 31 cases
  54 , normal ratio profiles were found, whereas 26 cases 46 had aberrant profiles.
  The most common aberrations were gains of 9p n 14 , 11 n 9 , and 21q n 5 and loss
  of 22 n 7 . In earlier reports on cytogenetics of lymphomas, gains of 9p are described
  as characteristic of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, but the consensus region
  is smaller than in the present study 9p23pter vs 9p13pter . Therefore, we suggest
  a stronger genetic affinity between MM and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma than
  MM and other B-cell lymphomas. To support this suggestion, more molecular cytogenetic
  techniques and expression analyses have to be performed.
