abstract: Differences in survival have been reported between pediatric and adult acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia. The inferior prognosis in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  is not fully understood but could be attributed, in part, to differences in genomic
  alterations found in adult as compared to in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
