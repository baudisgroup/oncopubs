abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was carried out on 15 primary testicular
  germ cell tumors TGCT of adolescents and adults and two metastatic residual tumors
  after chemotherapeutic treatment. The results were compared with karyotypic data
  obtained form the same tumor specimens after direct harvesting of metaphases or
  short-term in vitro culture. Both techniques revealed that the most consistent abnormality
  in primary TGCT is gain of 12p-sequences. Although in most cases over-representation
  of the complete short arm was observed, CGH revealed a specific amplification of
  12p11.1-p12.1 region in two independent primary tumors. In addition, loss of parts
  of chromosome 13 always involving q31-qter , and gain of parts of chromosome 7 mostly
  involving q11 , parts of chromosome 8, and the X chromosome were detected in more
  than 25 of the tumors by this latter technique. Loss of 6q15-q21 in both residual
  tumors analyzed may suggest a role for this anomaly in acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic
  treatment. Overall, the CGH analyses confirmed gains and losses of certain chromosomal
  regions in TGCT as observed by karyotyping, and thus support their role in the development
  of these neoplasms. The amplification of a restricted region of 12p in primary TGCT
  confirms and extends our previous observations and, as such, represents an important
  step forward in the identification of gene s on 12p relevant for the pathogenesis
  of these tumors.
