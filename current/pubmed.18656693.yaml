abstract: A 4-year-old patient, who was newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  ALL , was referred to us for cytogenetic evaluation. He had a normal karyotype by
  G-banded chromosome analysis, and a deletion of the ETV6 alias TEL gene was determined
  by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using DNA probes specific for t 12
  21 , which leads to ETV6 RUNX1 alias TEL AML1 gene fusion, but no translocation
  was found between the two genes. To find out if there were possibly additional subtle
  chromosomal changes undetectable by routine cytogenetics, high-density 385K oligo
  array comparative genomic hybridization CGH assay was performed. Besides the confirmation
  of the 12p deletion, a deletion of a 12-megabase Mb chromosomal segment on 14q24.1
  approximately q24.3 was also detected. Within the deleted 12-Mb region, there were
  a total of 155 genes and at least 28 of these were cancer-related genes. A similar
  approach by array CGH in patients with ALL, especially in those patients with 12p
  deletion, could help to determine the significance of this rare event.
