abstract: Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis, we, and others, have
  shown that there is a high and consistent incidence of chromosome 1q copy gain in
  human hepatocellular carcinoma HCC . Chromosome 1 rearrangements, that involved
  peri-centromeric breakpoints, have also been frequently reported in karyotypic studies
  of HCC. Satellite DNA hypomethylation has been postulated as the mechanism underlying
  the induction of chromosome 1 peri-centromeric instability in many human cancers
  and in individuals with the rare recessive disorder ICF immunodeficiency, centromeric
  heterochromatin instability, facial anomalies . In this study, we have investigated
  the role of DNA hypomethylation in 1q copy gain in HCC by examining the methylation
  status of chromosome 1 heterochromatin DNA band 1q12 . Thirty-six histologically
  confirmed samples of HCC were studied 24 paired tumor and adjacent nontumorous liver
  tissues, and 12 tumor only . Hypomethylation of satellite 2 Sat2 DNA in 1q12 was
  analyzed by Southern blotting using methyl-sensitive enzyme digestion. In parallel,
  all cases were analyzed by CGH. A strong correlation between hypomethylated Sat2
  sequences and 1q copy gain with a 1q12 breakpoint was found P amp lt 0.001 . We
  postulate that such hypomethylation alters the interaction between the CpG-rich
  satellite DNA and chromatin proteins, resulting in heterochromatin decondensation,
  breakage and aberrant 1q formation. Spectral karyotyping further supported the presence
  of fragile 1q12 in HCC. Of particular interest was the finding of Sat2 DNA hypomethylation
  in 5 of 24 adjacent nontumorous liver tissues examined. These tissues showed no
  evidence of malignancy on histological examination nor did they display any CGH
  abnormalities. Our findings suggest a role for Sat2 demethylation in the early stages
  of the stepwise progression of liver carcinogenesis.
