abstract: "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder
  with heterogeneous clinical, morphological and genetic characteristics. Clonal cytogenetic
  abnormalities are found in 20-30% of patients with CMML. Patients with low risk
  cytogenetic features (normal karyotype and isolated loss of Y chromosome) account
  for â\x88¼80% of CMML patients and often fall into the low risk categories of CMML
  prognostic scores. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A)
  karyotyping could detect cryptic chromosomal alterations with prognostic impact
  in these subgroup of patients. SNP-A were performed at diagnosis in 128 CMML patients
  with low risk karyotypes or uninformative results for conventional G-banding cytogenetics
  (CC). Copy number alterations (CNAs) and regions of copy number neutral loss of
  heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) were detected in 67% of patients. Recurrent CNAs included
  gains in regions 8p12 and 21q22 as well as losses in 10q21.1 and 12p13.2. Interstitial
  CNN-LOHs were recurrently detected in the following regions: 4q24-4q35, 7q32.1-7q36.3,
  and 11q13.3-11q25. Statistical analysis showed that some of the alterations detected
  by SNP-A associated with the patients' outcome. A shortened overall survival (OS)
  and progression free survival (PFS) was observed in cases where the affected size
  of the genome (considering CNAs and CNN-LOHs) was >11 Mb. In addition, presence
  of interstitial CNN-LOH was predictive of poor OS. Presence of CNAs (â\x89¥1) associated
  with poorer OS and PFS in the patients with myeloproliferative CMML. Overall, SNP-A
  analysis increased the diagnostic yield in patients with low risk cytogenetic features
  or uninformative CC and added prognostic value to this subset of patients. Am. J.
