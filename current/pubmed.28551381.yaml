abstract: 8-Oxoguanine, a common mutagenic DNA lesion, generates G:C>T:A transversions
  via mispairing with adenine during DNA replication. When operating normally, the
  MUTYH DNA glycosylase prevents 8-oxoguanine-related mutagenesis by excising the
  incorporated adenine. Biallelic MUTYH mutations impair this enzymatic function and
  are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) in MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP)
  syndrome. Here, we perform whole-exome sequencing that reveals a modest mutator
  phenotype in MAP CRCs compared to sporadic CRC stem cell lines or bulk tumours.
  The excess G:C>T:A transversion mutations in MAP CRCs exhibits a novel mutational
  signature, termed Signature 36, with a strong sequence dependence. The MUTYH mutational
  signature reflecting persistent 8-oxoG:A mismatches occurs frequently in the APC,
  KRAS, PIK3CA, FAT4, TP53, FAT1, AMER1, KDM6A, SMAD4 and SMAD2 genes that are associated
  with CRC. The occurrence of Signature 36 in other types of human cancer indicates
  that DNA 8-oxoguanine-related mutations might contribute to the development of cancer
  in other organs.
