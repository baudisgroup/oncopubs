abstract: In acute myeloid leukemia AML and myelodysplastic syndromes MDS there are
  frequently complex karyotypes with multiple structurally altered chromosomes, many
  of which are marker chromosomes of unknown origin. The aim of this study was to
  apply comparative genomic hybridization CGH to cases of AML or MDS in transformation
  submitted for routine cytogenetic analysis to investigate whether this approach
  would yield any further information and, if possible, to predict which cases would
  benefit from CGH analysis. Nineteen cases with AML or MDS in transformation were
  analyzed. CGH revealed nine cases with gains or losses of chromosomal material.
  In six of these cases the chromosomal location of this material was not apparent
  from cytogenetic analysis especially when multiple markers were present. By using
  fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH with specific libraries for the chromosome
  regions that showed discordance between CGH and conventional cytogenetics, we were
  able to identify the chromosome location of material within the karyotype. In this
  group of six patients, four cases of an unbalanced translocation involving regions
  of chromosomes 5 and 17 were characterized. Three of these cases had additional
  abnormalities, including two cases with regions of amplification in which oncogenes
  are located MYC, MLL and one case with a dic 7 21 p10 p10 . In all six cases it
  was possible to characterize complex chromosomal aberrations such as derivative
  chromosomes, marker chromosomes, and ring chromosomes. This study demonstrates that
  CGH can detect true gain and loss of critical chromosome regions more accurately
  than conventional karyotyping in cases with very complex karyotypes, and can thus
  prove useful in predicting prognosis and pinpointing areas of the genome that require
  further study. Also, CGH can be a useful technique to identify the origin of marker
  chromosomes, and it can assist in choice of probes for confirmatory FISH, when there
  is no clue provided from the analysis of G-banded chromosomes.
