abstract: As recent technological innovations make it possible to clarify the concordant
  relationship between genomic alterations and aberrant gene expression during the
  progression of colorectal cancer CRC , we aimed at identifying new overexpressing
  genes with genomic amplification on the responsible loci in CRC. The candidate gene
  was found using cDNA microarray and array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis after laser microdissection LMD in 132 Japanese CRC. We focused on
  SUGT1, which is associated with the assembling of kinetochore proteins at the metaphase
  of the cell cycle, with significant association between genetic alterations and
  expression. SUGT1 mRNA expression was evaluated in 98 CRC cases to determine the
  clinicopathological significance of SUGT1 expression. The mean level of SUGT1 mRNA
  expression in tumor tissue specimens was significantly higher than in non-tumor
  tissue. The high SUGT1 expression group was characterized by a significantly elevated
  frequency of recurrence and a significantly poorer prognosis than the low expression
  group. There was a significant association between poor prognosis of CRC cases and
  the overexpression of SUGT1 with genomic amplification of the loci concordantly.
  The amplification of SUGT1 might give rise to promote the transcription of the gene
  directly subsequent to the progression of CRC cases with worsening prognosis.
