abstract: Pancreatic carcinomas display highly complex chromosomal abnormalities,
  including many structural and numerical aberrations. There is ample evidence indicating
  that some of these abnormalities, such as recurrent amplifications and homozygous
  deletions, contribute to tumorigenesis by altering expression levels of critical
  oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. To increase the understanding of gene copy
  number changes in pancreatic carcinomas and to identify key amplification deletion
  targets, we applied genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization to
  31 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Two different microarrays were used, one containing
  3,565 fluorescence in situ hybridization-verified bacterial artificial chromosome
  clones and one containing 25,468 cDNA clones representing 17,494 UniGene clusters.
  Overall, the analyses revealed a high genomic complexity, with several copy number
  changes detected in each case. Specifically, 60 amplicons at 32 different locations
  were identified, most frequently located within 8q 8 cases , 12p 7 cases , 7q 5
  cases , 18q 5 cases , 19q 5 cases , 6p 4 cases , and 8p 4 cases . Amplifications
  of 8q and 12p were mainly clustered at 8q23-24 and 12p11-12, respectively, whereas
  amplifications on other chromosome arms were more dispersed. Furthermore, our analyses
  identified several novel homozygously deleted segments located to 9p24, 9p21, 9q32,
  10p12, 10q22, 12q24, and 18q23. The individual complexity and aberration patterns
  varied substantially among cases, i.e., some cell lines were characterized mainly
  by high-level amplifications, whereas others showed primarily whole-arm imbalances
  and homozygous deletions. The described amplification and deletion targets are likely
  to contain genes important in pancreatic tumorigenesis.
