abstract: Tumor grade is an established indicator of breast cancer outcome, although
  considerable heterogeneity exists even within-grade. Around 25 of grade III invasive
  ductal breast carcinomas are associated with a amp quot basal amp quot phenotype,
  and these tumors are reported to be a distinct subgroup. We have investigated whether
  this group of breast cancers has a distinguishing pattern of genetic alterations
  and which of these may relate to the different clinical outcome of these patients.
  We performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis on 43 grade III invasive
  ductal breast carcinomas positive for basal cytokeratin 14, as well as 43 grade-
  and age-matched CK14-negative controls, all with up to 25 years median, 7 years
  of clinical follow-up. Significant differences in CGH alterations were seen between
  the two groups in terms of mean number of changes CK14 ve - 6.5, CK14-ve - 10.3
  P 0.0012 and types of alterations at chromosomes 4q, 7q, 8q, 9p, 13q, 16p, 17p,
  17q, 19p, 19q, 20p, 20q and Xp. Supervised and unsupervised algorithms separated
  the two groups on CGH data alone with 76 and 74 accuracy, respectively. Hierarchical
  clustering revealed distinct subgroups, one of which contained 18 42 of the CK14
  ve tumors. This subgroup had significantly shorter overall survival P 0.0414 than
  other grade III tumors, regardless of CK14 status, and was an independent prognostic
  marker P 0.031 . These data provide evidence that the amp quot basal amp quot phenotype
  on its own does not convey a poor prognosis. Basal tumors are also heterogeneous
  with only a subset, identifiable by pattern of genetic alterations, exhibiting a
  shorter overall survival. Robust characterization of this basal group is necessary
  if it is to have a major impact on management of patients with breast cancer.
