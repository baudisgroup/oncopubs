abstract: Representational Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis (ROMA) detects genomic
  amplifications and deletions with boundaries defined at a resolution of approximately
  50 kb. We have used this technique to examine 243 breast tumors from two separate
  studies for which detailed clinical data were available. The very high resolution
  of this technology has enabled us to identify three characteristic patterns of genomic
  copy number variation in diploid tumors and to measure correlations with patient
  survival. One of these patterns is characterized by multiple closely spaced amplicons,
  or "firestorms," limited to single chromosome arms. These multiple amplifications
  are highly correlated with aggressive disease and poor survival even when the rest
  of the genome is relatively quiet. Analysis of a selected subset of clinical material
  suggests that a simple genomic calculation, based on the number and proximity of
  genomic alterations, correlates with life-table estimates of the probability of
  overall survival in patients with primary breast cancer. Based on this sample, we
  generate the working hypothesis that copy number profiling might provide information
  useful in making clinical decisions, especially regarding the use or not of systemic
  therapies (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy), in the management of operable primary
  breast cancer with ostensibly good prognosis, for example, small, node-negative,
  hormone-receptor-positive diploid cases.
