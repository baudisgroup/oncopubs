abstract: Supernumerary rings in the context of a simple karyotype characterize several
  low-grade malignant tumors of soft tissue and bone. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma
  is an uncommon low-grade sarcoma, the cytogenetics of which has not yet been reported.
  Here we describe the first molecular-cytogenetic characterization of a pulmonary
  metastasis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. The histology of the primary and recurrent
  tumors was consistent with the diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma of the
  usual type, whereas the pulmonary metastasis was of the amp quot giant rosettes
  amp quot variant. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a ring chromosome. Because gain
  of material of chromosomes 7 and 16 was detected by CGH, the ring chromosome is
  assumed to be composed of material from these respective chromosomes.
