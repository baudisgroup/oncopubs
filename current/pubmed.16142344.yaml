abstract: Despite the continuous progress in molecular methodology, the genetic events
  involved in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic head ductal carcinomas PHDCs and ampulla
  of Vater cancer AVC remain largely unknown. Their proximity within the confined
  region lends them to very similar clinical presentations and operative approaches.
  However, it is unclear why AVC has a significantly better outcome than PHDCs. The
  drastic difference may arise from the distinct tumor origins. Therefore, the study
  of genetic alterations within these two neighboring tumors may elucidate their mechanisms.
  However, previous genetic analysis of PHDCs may have been influenced by contamination
  of excessive stromal and inflammatory cells in the background. To date, most comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH studies of pancreatic cancer are based in cell lines or
  specimens that were not microdissected. Even AVC has a paucity of data. To determine
  the differences of the genetic alterations of PHDCs and AVC, we used laser capture
  microdissection combined with degenerated oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction
  and CGH to identify the chromosomal aberrations. Frequent gains were found on 5p,
  13q, 3q, 8q, 1p, 2p, 2q, 3q, 7p, 8p, 9p, 13q, and 21q, while frequent losses were
  located on 7p, 18q, 1p, 11q, 16q, 19q, 1q, 2q, 3p, 19p, and 17p in PHDCs. In AVC,
  chromosomal gains occurred frequently in 7p, 8q, 1q, 2q, 3p, 4p, 7p, 3q, 5p, 20p,
  20q, 4q, 5q, 7q, 11p, 12p, 13q, 14q, 18p, 18q, 21q, 9p, 10p, and 15q, and losses
  frequently in 17q, 1p, 18q, 19p, 5q, 10p, and 10q. This is the first report on the
  CGH profiles of AVC. These data provide evidence that chromosomal gains amplifications
  of AVC differ from those of PHDCs. Among them, chromosomal gains on 1q25, 7p15,
  8q23, and 3p21, and losses on 17q24, were statistically higher in AVC than PHDCs
  P amp lt 0.05 . The gains and losses suggest possible putative tumor suppressors
  and oncogenes that may be involved in the different carcinogenic pathways of AVC.
