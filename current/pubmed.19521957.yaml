abstract: The identification of genetic aberrations may help understand the mechanisms
  of tumorigenesis and has important implications in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.
  We applied Illuminas 317K high-density single nucleotide polymorphism SNP arrays
  to profile chromosomal aberrations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC from
  80 patients and analyzed the association of LOH amplification events with clinicopathological
  characteristics and telomere length. The most common loss of heterozygosity LOH
  were 3p 69 cases including 38 whole 3p arm losses, 30 large fragment LOH spanning
  3p21-36 , and 1 interstitial LOH spanning 3p12-14, 3p21-22, 3p24.1-24.2 and 3p24.3
  , followed by chromosome losses at 8p12-pter, 6q23.3-27, 14q24.1-qter, 9q32-qter,
  10q22.3-qter, 9p13.3-pter, 4q28.3-qter and 13q12.1-21.1. We also found several smallest
  overlapping regions of LOH that contained tumor suppressor genes. One smallest LOH
  in 8p12 had a size of 0.29 Mb and only contained one gene NRG1 . The most frequent
  chromosome gains were at 5q 32 cases , including 10 whole 5q amplification, 21 large
  amplifications encompassing 5q32-ter and 1 focal amplification in 5q35.3 0.42 Mb
  . The other common chromosome gains were 1q25.1-qter, 7q21.13-qter, 8q24.12-qter
  and whole 7p arm. Significant associations of LOH at 9p, 9q, 14q and 18q were observed
  with higher nuclear grade. Significant associations with tumor stage were observed
  for LOH at 14q, 18p and 21q. Finally, we found that tumors with LOH at 2q, 6p, 6q,
  9p, 9q and 17p had significantly shorter telomere length than those without LOH.
  This is the first study to use Illuminas SNP-CGH array that provides a close estimate
  of the size and frequency of chromosome LOH and amplifications of ccRCC. The identified
  regions and genes may become diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as potential
  targets of therapy.
