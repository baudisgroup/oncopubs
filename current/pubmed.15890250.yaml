abstract: Neuroendocrine carcinoid tumours of the thymus are rare neoplasms characterized
  by a highly malignant clinical behavior. Some of these tumors are associated with
  MEN1. In this study we evaluated 10 cases of sporadic thymic neuroendocrine tumours
  using immunohistochemistry and comparative genomic hybridization CGH . All tumours
  showed a diffuse expression of neuron specific enolase NSE and synaptophysin. Chromosomal
  imbalances were detected in 8 10 cases, the most frequent gains were seen on chromosome
  Xp 3 10 cases , 7p, 7q, 11q, 12q, and 20q 2 10 each , losses were most frequently
  detected at 6q 5 10 each , 6p 3 10 each , 4q 3 10 each , 3p, 10q, 11q and 13 q 2
  10 each . These CGH data show a degree of overlap with chromosomal imbalances commonly
  observed in advanced thymomas.
