abstract: Recurrent metastatic melanoma provides a unique opportunity to analyze disease
  evolution in metastatic cancer. Here, we followed up eight patients with an unusually
  prolonged history of metastatic melanoma, who developed a total of 26 recurrences
  over several years. Cell lines derived from each metastasis were analyzed by comparative
  genomic hybridization and global transcript analysis. We observed that conserved,
  patient-specific characteristics remain stable in recurrent metastatic melanoma
  even after years and several recurrences. Differences among individual patients
  exceeded within-patient lesion variability, both at the DNA copy number (P<0.001)
  and RNA gene expression level (P<0.001). Conserved patient-specific traits included
  expression of several cancer/testis antigens and the c-kit proto-oncogene throughout
  multiple recurrences. Interestingly, subsequent recurrences of different patients
  did not display consistent or convergent changes toward a more aggressive disease
  phenotype. Finally, sequential recurrences of the same patient did not descend progressively
  from each other, as irreversible mutations such as homozygous deletions were frequently
  not inherited from previous metastases. This study suggests that the late evolution
  of metastatic melanoma, which markedly turns an indolent disease into a lethal phase,
  is prone to preserve case-specific traits over multiple recurrences and occurs through
  a series of random events that do not follow a consistent stepwise process.
