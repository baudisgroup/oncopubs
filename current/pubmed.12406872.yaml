abstract: Genomic aberrations in a series of paired biopsy samples from patients who
  presented initially with follicle center lymphoma FCL and subsequently transformed
  to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL were measured by array comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . The consequences of these aberrations on gene expression were
  determined by comparison with expression analysis on these specimens using cDNA
  microarrays. A heterogeneous pattern of acquired genomic abnormalities was observed
  upon transformation, some of which were recurrent in small subsets of patients.
  Some of the genomic aberration acquired upon transformation, such as gain amplification
  of 1q21-q24, 2p16 REL BCL11A gene loci , 3q27-q29 including the BCL6 locus , 7q11.2-q22.1,
  12pter-q12, 18q21 including the BCL2 locus and Xq, and deletion of 6q22-q24, 13q14-q21
  and 17p13 P53 locus have been previously implicated in the FCL DLBCL pathogenesis.
  In addition, novel genomic imbalances not previously reported in association with
  FCL transformation, such as overrepresentation of 4p12-pter, 5p12-p15, 6p12.3-p21,
  9p23, 9q13-q31, 16q, 17q21, and loss of 1p36.3, 4q21-q23, 5q21-q23, 9q31-qter, 11q24-q25,
  and 15q23, were identified. We observed a differential expression profile of many
  genes within regions of gain and deletion upon transformation, including novel target
  genes associated with FCL transformation. However, other genes did not show deregulated
  expression despite their location within these areas. In summary, the combination
  of array CGH and expression analysis provides a more comprehensive picture of the
  transformation of FCL to DLBCL. This process is associated with the acquisition
  of a variable spectrum of genomic imbalances affecting recurrent chromosomal areas
  that harbor overexpressed or underexpressed genes targeted upon transformation.
