abstract: Pyothorax-associated lymphoma PAL develops in the pleural cavity of patients
  with a long history of pyothorax. Epstein-Barr virus EBV is also involved in PAL,
  similar to lymphomas in immunodeficient patients. Here we examined T-lymphocyte
  subsets as well as c-myc and REL gene amplification in PAL tissues.
