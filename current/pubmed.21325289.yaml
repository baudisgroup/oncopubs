abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNST are highly aggressive sarcomas
  with variable patient survival and few known prognostically relevant genomic biomarkers.
  To identify survival-associated genomic biomarkers, we performed high-resolution
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH on a large set of MPNSTs.
