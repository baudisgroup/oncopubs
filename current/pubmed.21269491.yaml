abstract: Genomic instability in cancer leads to abnormal genome copy number alterations
  CNA as a mechanism underlying tumorigenesis. Using microarrays and other technologies,
  tumor CNA are detected by comparing tumor sample CN to normal reference sample CN.
  While advances in microarray technology have improved detection of copy number alterations,
  the increase in the number of measured signals, noise from array probes, variations
  in signal-to-noise ratio across batches and disparity across laboratories leads
  to significant limitations for the accurate identification of CNA regions when comparing
  tumor and normal samples.
