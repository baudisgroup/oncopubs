abstract: Loss of the long arm of chromosome 16 16q is observed in the vast majority
  of low grade grade I GI invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type IDC-NSTs ,
  whereas this event is uncommonly seen in high grade grade III GIII IDC-NSTs. Together
  with data on the pathology and genetics of breast cancer recurrences, this has led
  to the proposal that GI and GIII breast cancers evolve through distinct genetic
  pathways and that progression from GI to GIII is an unlikely biological phenomenon.
  We compared the genomic profiles of GIII-IDC-NSTs with 16q whole arm loss 16qWL
  according to estrogen receptor ER status. 16qWL was found in 36.5 of cases and was
  significantly associated with ER expression and luminal phenotype. ER GIII-IDC-NSTs
  with 16qWL displayed significantly higher levels of genomic instability than ER
  IDC-NSTs without 16qWL. Furthermore, ER and ER- IDC-NSTs stratified according to
  the presence of 16qWL harbored distinct patterns of genetic aberrations. Interestingly,
  ER 16qWL tumors displayed genetic features usually found in tumors with homologous
  DNA repair defects and significantly more frequently harbored heterozygous loss
  of BRCA2 than the remaining ER cancers. Our results demonstrate that approximately
  one third of GIII tumors harbor 16qWL, confirming that progression from low to high
  grade breast cancer is not found in the majority of breast cancers. 16qWL was significantly
  more prevalent in ER luminal GIII-IDC-NSTs. Given that GI breast cancers harbor
  a luminal phenotype, our results suggest that if progression from GI to GIII breast
  cancer does happen, it may preferentially occur in breast cancers of luminal phenotype.
