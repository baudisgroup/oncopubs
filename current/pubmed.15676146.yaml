abstract: Cervical and vulvar cancers are diseases of the female lower genital tract,
  and high-risk human papillomavirus HPV infection is the most important risk factor
  for the development of both cancers. However, it is clear that additional genetic
  events are necessary for tumor progression, particularly in HPV-negative cases.
  We detected the presence of high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 genomes by gene-specific polymerase
  chain reaction and searched for common genetic imbalances by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH in 28 cervical and 8 vulvar tumor samples and 7 cancer cell lines.
  The presence of the HPV genome was detected in 25 28 89 cervical tumors and 6 8
  75 vulvar tumors. CGH of cervical and vulvar tumor samples revealed a consistent
  pattern of genetic changes in both cancers. Frequent gains were found in 1q, 3q,
  5p, and 8q, and less consistent losses were detected in 2q, 3p, 4p, and 11p. Notably,
  a high-level amplification of 3q was found in 9 28 32 cervical tumors and 1 8 12.5
  vulvar tumors, indicating a pivotal role of gain of 3q in cervical and vulvar carcinogenesis.
  Furthermore, gains of 5p identified in 9 28 32 cervical tumors and 3 8 37.5 vulvar
  tumors were seldom described, particularly in vulvar tumors. Our findings suggest
  that cervical and vulvar carcinomas bear similar chromosomal alteration hot spots
  that largely coincide with common genomic lesions during tumor progression, besides
  the initiation by infection and integration of oncogenic HPV.
