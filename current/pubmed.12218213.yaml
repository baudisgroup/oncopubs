abstract: The cytogenetic abnormalities of granulosa cell tumors GCT of the ovary
  are only partially known. Up to now, mainly numerical chromosomal aberrations have
  been described. Therefore we performed a comprehensive study on paraffin-embedded
  material of 20 GCT 17 adult, 3 juvenile patient age between 16 and 78 y combining
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH using
  DNA-specific probes for chromosome 12, 17, 22, and X DNA cytometry and immunohistochemistry
  inhibin, p53, Ki67 . By DNA cytometry, 16 of 20 tumors 80 were diploid. However,
  6 of 16 diploid tumors 37 showed aberrations by FISH. FISH revealed monosomy 22
  in 8 18 cases 40 trisomy 12 in 5 20 25 monosomy X in 2 20 10 and loss of chromosome
  17 in one case 5 . The main findings by CGH were gains of chromosomes 12 6 cases,
  33 and 14 6 cases, 33 and losses of chromosomes 22 7 cases, 35 and X 1 case, 5 ,
  mostly comprising whole chromosomes or chromosome arms. Inhibin and p53 were expressed
  in 100 and 95 of the tumors, respectively. The Ki67 index ranged from 0 to 61 .
  Neither immunohistochemistry, nor DNA cytometry and molecular genetic analysis,
  provided statistically significant prognostic information. In summary, our study
  reveals a distinctive pattern of cytogenetic alterations in GCT. Our observations
  confirm earlier reports that trisomy 12 and 14 are frequent aberrations however,
  monosomy 22 seemingly is even more prevalent.
