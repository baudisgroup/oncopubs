abstract: Ovarian carcinosarcoma is a rare subtype of ovarian cancer with poor clinical
  outcomes. The low incidence of this disease makes accrual to large clinical trials
  challenging. However, studies have shown that treatment responses in patient-derived
  xenograft (PDX) models correlate with matched-patient responses in the clinic, supporting
  their use for preclinical testing of standard and novel therapies. An ovarian carcinosarcoma
  PDX is presented herein and showed resistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel (similar
  to the patient) but exhibited significant sensitivity to ifosfamide and paclitaxel.
  The PDX demonstrated overexpression of EGFR mRNA and gene amplification by array
  comparative genomic hybridization (log2 ratio 0.399). EGFR phosphorylation was also
  detected. Angiogensis and insulin-like growth factor pathways were also implicated
  by overexpression of VEGFC and IRS1. In order to improve response to chemotherapy,
  the PDX was treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without a pan-HER and VEGF
  inhibitor (BMS-690514) but there was no tumor growth inhibition or improved animal
  survival, which may be explained by a KRAS mutation. Resistance was also observed
  when the IGF-1R inhibitor BMS-754807 was combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel. Because
  poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors have activity in ovarian cancer patients,
  with and without BRCA mutations, ABT-888 was also tested but found to have no activity.
  Pathogenic mutations were also detected in TP53 and PIK3CA. In conclusion, ifosfamide/paclitaxel
  was superior to carboplatin/paclitaxel in this ovarian carcinosarcoma PDX and gene
  overexpression or amplification alone was not sufficient to predict response to
  targeted therapy. Better predictive markers of response are needed.
