abstract: Hepatic resection is the most curative treatment option for early-stage
  hepatocellular carcinoma, but is associated with a high recurrence rate, which exceeds
  50% at 5 years after surgery. Understanding the genetic basis of hepatocellular
  carcinoma at surgically curable stages may enable the identification of new molecular
  biomarkers that accurately identify patients in need of additional early therapeutic
  interventions. Whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis was performed on
  231 hepatocellular carcinomas (72% with hepatitis B viral infection) that were classified
  as early-stage hepatocellular carcinomas, candidates for surgical resection. Recurrent
  mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Unsupervised genomic analyses identified
  an association between specific genetic aberrations and postoperative clinical outcomes.
  Recurrent somatic mutations were identified in nine genes, including TP53, CTNNB1,
  AXIN1, RPS6KA3, and RB1. Recurrent homozygous deletions in FAM123A, RB1, and CDKN2A,
  and high-copy amplifications in MYC, RSPO2, CCND1, and FGF19 were detected. Pathway
  analyses of these genes revealed aberrations in the p53, Wnt, PIK3/Ras, cell cycle,
  and chromatin remodeling pathways. RB1 mutations were significantly associated with
  cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival after resection (multivariate P = 0.038
  and P = 0.012, respectively). FGF19 amplifications, known to activate Wnt signaling,
  were mutually exclusive with CTNNB1 and AXIN1 mutations, and significantly associated
  with cirrhosis (P = 0.017).  RB1 mutations can be used as a prognostic molecular
  biomarker for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Further study is required to
  investigate the potential role of FGF19 amplification in driving hepatocarcinogenesis
  in patients with liver cirrhosis and to investigate the potential of anti-FGF19
  treatment in these patients.  ï¿½ 2014 by the American Association for the Study
