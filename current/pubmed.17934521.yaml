abstract: Astrocytic, oligodendroglial and mixed gliomas are the commonest gliomas
  in adults. They have distinct phenotypes and clinical courses, but as they exist
  as a continuous histological spectrum, differentiating them can be difficult. Co-deletions
  of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered
  as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas
  has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated
  108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were
  rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in
  anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed
  that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P=0.005).
  In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified. No somatic mutations
  were found among the five genes located in the homozygously deleted region. However,
  the CpG island of TNFRSF9 was hypermethylated in 19% of astrocytic tumours and 87%
  of glioma cell lines. TNFRSF9 expression was upregulated after demethylation of
  glioma cell lines. Akt3 amplifications were found in four glioblastomas. Our results
  indicate that 1p deletions are common anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas
  but are distinct from the 1p abnormalities in oligodendrogliomas.
