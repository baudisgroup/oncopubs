abstract: Genetic alterations in enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma ETL are unknown
  so far. In this series, 38 cases of ETL were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . CGH revealed chromosomal imbalances in 87 of cases analyzed, with recurrent
  gains of genetic material involving chromosomes 9q in 58 of cases , 7q 24 , 5q 18
  , and 1q 16 . Recurrent losses of genetic material occurred on chromosomes 8p and
  13q 24 each , and 9p 18 . In this first systematic genetic study on ETL, chromosomal
  gains on 9q minimal overlapping region 9q33-q34 were found to be highly characteristic
  of ETL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on four cases of ETL, using
  a probe for 9q34, indicated frequent and multiple gains of chromosomal material
  at 9q34 up to nine signals per case . Among 16 patients with ETL who survived initial
  disease presentation, patients with more than three chromosomal gains or losses
  n 11 followed a worse clinical course than those with three or less imbalances n
  5 . The observation of similar genetic alterations in ETL and in primary gastric
  n 4 and colonic n 1 T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, is suggestive of a
  genetic relationship of gastrointestinal T-cell lymphomas at either localization.
