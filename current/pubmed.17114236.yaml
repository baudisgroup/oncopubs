abstract: 'Glioblastoma is classified into two subtypes on the basis of clinical history:
  amp quot primary glioblastoma amp quot arising de novo without detectable antecedent
  disease and amp quot secondary glioblastoma amp quot evolving from a low-grade astrocytoma.
  Despite their distinctive clinical courses, they arrive at an indistinguishable
  clinical and pathologic end point highlighted by widespread invasion and resistance
  to therapy and, as such, are managed clinically as if they are one disease entity.
  Because the life history of a cancer cell is often reflected in the pattern of genomic
  alterations, we sought to determine whether primary and secondary glioblastomas
  evolve through similar or different molecular pathogenetic routes. Clinically annotated
  primary and secondary glioblastoma samples were subjected to high-resolution copy
  number analysis using oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization.
  Unsupervised classification using genomic nonnegative matrix factorization methods
  identified three distinct genomic subclasses. Whereas one corresponded to clinically
  defined primary glioblastomas, the remaining two stratified secondary glioblastoma
  into two genetically distinct cohorts. Thus, this global genomic analysis showed
  wide-scale differences between primary and secondary glioblastomas that were previously
  unappreciated, and has shown for the first time that secondary glioblastoma is heterogeneous
  in its molecular pathogenesis. Consistent with these findings, analysis of regional
  recurrent copy number alterations revealed many more events unique to these subclasses
  than shared. The pathobiological significance of these shared and subtype-specific
  copy number alterations is reinforced by their frequent occurrence, resident genes
  with clear links to cancer, recurrence in diverse cancer types, and apparent association
  with clinical outcome. We conclude that glioblastoma is composed of at least three
  distinct molecular subtypes, including novel subgroups of secondary glioblastoma,
  which may benefit from different therapeutic strategies.'
