abstract: Primary serous ovarian carcinoma OVCA and serous Fallopian tube carcinoma
  FTC , both belonging to the BRCA-linked tumour spectrum, share many properties and
  are treated similarly. However, a detailed molecular comparison has been lacking.
  We hypothesized that comparative genomic studies of serous OVCAs and FTCs should
  point to gene regions critically involved in their tumorigenesis. Array comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH analysis indicated that serous OVCAs and serous
  FTCs displayed common but also more distinctive patterns of recurrent changes. Targeted
  gene identification using a dedicated multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
  MLPA probe set directly identified EIF2C2 on 8q as a potentially important driver
  gene. Other previously unappreciated gained amplified genes included PSMB4 on 1q,
  MTSS1 on 8q, TEAD4 and TSPAN9 on 12p, and BCAS4 on 20q. SPINT2 and ACTN4 on 19q
  were predominantly found in FTCs. Gains amplifications of CCNE1 and MYC, often in
  conjunction with changes in genes of the AKT pathway, EVI1 and PTK2, seemed to be
  involved at earlier stages, whereas changes of ERBB2 were associated with advanced
  stages. The only BRCA1-mutated FTC shared common denominators with the sporadic
  tumours. In conclusion, the data suggest that serous OVCAs and FTCs, although related,
  exhibit differences in genomic profiles. In addition to known pathways, new genes
  pathways are likely to be involved, with changes in an miRNA-associated gene, EIF2C2,
  as one important new feature. Dedicated MLPA sets constitute potentially important
  tools for differential diagnosis and may provide footholds for tailored therapy.
