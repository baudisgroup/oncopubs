abstract: The development of array comparative genomic hybridization array CGH at
  tiling-path resolution has enabled the detection of gene-sized segmental DNA copy
  number gains and losses. Here, we present the first application of whole genome
  tiling-path array CGH to archival clinical specimens for the detailed analysis of
  oral squamous cell carcinomas OSCC . We describe the genomes of 20 OSCCs as well
  as a selection of matched normal DNA in unprecedented detail. Examination of their
  whole genome profiles enabled the identification of alterations ranging in size
  from whole-arm, segmental, to gene size alterations. Tiling-path resolution enabled
  the detection of many more alterations within each tumor than previously reported,
  many of which include narrow alterations found to be frequent events among the 20
  OSCCs. We report the presence of several novel frequent submegabase alterations,
  such as the 0.58 Mb gain at 5p15.2 containing triple functional domain TRIO , detected
  in 45 of cases. We also report the first coamplification of two gene clusters, by
  fine-mapping the precise base pair boundaries of the high-level amplification at
  11q22.2-22.3 containing both matrix metalloproteinase and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing
  protein 2 BIRC gene clusters. These results show the large improvement in detection
  sensitivity and resolution compared with genome interval marker arrays and the utility
  of tiling resolution array CGH for the detection of both submegabase and single
  copy gains and losses in cancer gene discovery.
