abstract: Medulloblastomas are highly malignant primitive neuroectodermal tumors of
  the cerebellum that display a wide variety of histopathological patterns. However,
  these patterns do not provide an accurate prediction of clinical-biological behavior
  and no satisfactory morphological grading system has ever been presented. Genetic
  alterations may provide additional diagnostic information and allow clinically relevant
  subgrouping of primitive neuroectodermal tumors. We examined 10 medulloblastomas
  and one medulloblastoma cell line. One amplification site on chromosome 8q24 was
  detected in the cell line corresponding to the known amplification of the c-myc
  gene in this cell line. The gain of 2p21-24 in two tumors was shown to represent
  amplification of the N-myc gene by Southern blot hybridization and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. The data show that the isochromosome 17 can be recognized
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH by the typical combination of loss of
  17p combined with gain of 17q. No specific pattern of genetic alterations could
  be linked to the clinical behavior of the tumors. We have compared our results with
  previous CGH studies on medulloblastomas.
