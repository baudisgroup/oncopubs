abstract: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Despite
  multimodal aggressive treatment, nearly half of the patients die as a result of
  this tumor. Identification of molecular markers for prognosis and development of
  novel pathogenesis-based therapies depends crucially on a better understanding of
  medulloblastoma pathomechanisms.
