abstract: 'Multiple basal cell carcinomas BCCs are a hallmark of Gorlin syndrome nevoid
  basal cell carcinoma syndrome , which is caused by mutation in the PTCH1 gene on
  9q22.3. However, there are several reports of familial cases with multiple BCCs
  without the associated defects of Gorlin syndrome. The possibility of underlying
  genetic abnormalities in these familial BCCs has not been explored previously. The
  present study investigated a possible genetic abnormality in two members of a family
  with multiple nonsyndromic BCCs. The possibility of Gorlin syndrome in this family
  was excluded by both the absence of any clinical and radiological features and the
  lack of mutation in PTCH1. Notably, whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH identified a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11.1 in both of the studied cases.
  A tiling path CGH array of the 22q11.1 region confirmed this microdeletion and mapped
  it between 14.46 and 14.5 Mb on chromosome 22q. The 34-kb region of this microdeletion
  includes three annotated genes: LOC644525, LOC100132389, and LOC729057. Although
  future studies of other families with the hereditary nonsyndromic BCCs are still
  warranted, this study identified an association between a microdeletion of 22q11.1
  and two familial cases of BCC.'
