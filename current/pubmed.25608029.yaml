abstract: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCC/PGL) are the solid tumour type
  most commonly associated with an inherited susceptibility syndrome. However, very
  little is known about the somatic genetic changes leading to tumorigenesis or malignant
  transformation. Here we perform whole-exome sequencing on a discovery set of 21
  PCC/PGL and identify somatic ATRX mutations in two SDHB-associated tumours. Targeted
  sequencing of a separate validation set of 103 PCC/PGL identifies somatic ATRX mutations
  in 12.6% of PCC/PGL. PCC/PGL with somatic ATRX mutations are associated with alternative
  lengthening of telomeres and clinically aggressive behaviour. This finding suggests
  that loss of ATRX, an SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling protein, is important in the
  development of clinically aggressive PCC/PGL.
