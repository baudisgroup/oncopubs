abstract: Development and progression of urinary bladder cancer is driven by an accumulation
  of genetic alterations. Most previous molecular and cytogenetic analyses of urinary
  bladder cancer were focused on advanced tumor stages. To learn more about molecular
  cytogenetic changes in early bladder cancer stages we analyzed 56 superficial carcinomas
  of the urinary bladder by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . CGH is based on
  the simultaneous hybridization of differentially labeled tumor and normal DNAs to
  normal metaphase chromosomes. CGH allows the detection of all DNA sequence copy
  number changes deletions, DNA sequence copy number gains, amplifications of a tumor
  in one examination. Deletions were most frequently found at 9q 20 of 56 patients
  36 , chromosome Y 15 of 43 male patients 35 , 9p 28 , 11q 16 , 11p 13 , and 10q
  11 . DNA sequence copy number gains were most prevalent at 1q 34 , 8q 22 , 17q 15
  , 20q 13 , and 12q 11 . There was a significant increase in the number of aberrations
  with tumor stage pTa vs. pT1 p 0.0003 and histologic grade p 0.0001 . Several specific
  alterations were significantly more frequent in pT1 than in pTa tumors including
  deletions at 2q, 8p, and 11p as well as gains at 1q, 3p, 3q, 5p, 6p, 8q, and 10p.
  These loci are candidates for carrying genes involved in invasive tumor growth in
  bladder cancer. Overall, these data show that marked genetic differences exist between
  pTa and papillary pT1 bladder cancer. This challenges the concept of grouping these
  tumors together in one group as amp quot superficial bladder cancer amp quot .
