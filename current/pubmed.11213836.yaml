abstract: The characterization of clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical,
  and genetic features of intimal sarcomas arising in the pulmonary artery is presented
  in this study. Four resected lungs, one endarterectomy specimen and three biopsies
  from eight patients four males and four females median age 41 years suffering from
  intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery using conventional stains, immunohistochemistry,
  and comparative genomic hybridization CGH were analyzed. The predominant clinical
  presentation was dyspnea all eight patients and febrile pulmonary disease six of
  eight . Signs of embolic lung disease were present in all patients. One patient
  died postoperatively, six patients died of disease 8-35 months after presentation,
  and one patient was alive 6 months after surgery. Histopathological examination
  of the submitted material showed spindle cell, partially myxoid and pleomorphic
  sarcomas. Metastases were histologically confirmed in three patients lung, pleura,
  and skull . Immunohistochemically, vimentin was strongly expressed in all tumors.
  Focal positivity was observed for alpha smooth muscle actin, CD117, CD68, p53, and
  bcl2. No reaction could be obtained for endothelial markers. The proliferation index
  Ki-67 was between 5 and 80 . Six examined tumors were positive for mdm2. In the
  CGH analysis, gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region were found in six
  of eight tumors 75 . Other, less consistent alterations, were losses on 3p, 3q,
  4q, 9p, 11q, 13q, Xp, and Xq, gains on 7p, 17p, and 17q, and amplifications on 4q,
  5p, 6p, and 11q. Intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery are tumors with an unfavorable
  prognosis and poorly differentiated morphology. A majority of tumors show a consistent
  genetic alteration gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region and overexpression
  of mdm2, implicating the mdm2 p53 pathway as a possible mechanism in the tumor pathogenesis.
