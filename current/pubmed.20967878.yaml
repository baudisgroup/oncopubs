abstract: In acute myeloid leukemia AML , nonrandom clonal chromosome aberrations
  are detectable in  55 of adult cases. Translocation t 8 21 q22 q22 resulting in
  the 5RUNX1 3RUNX1T1 fusion gene occurs in  8 of AML cases. Also, ins 8 21 and ins
  21 8 have been described that show a broad heterogeneity at the molecular level
  with inserted fragment sizes ranging from 2.4 to 44 Mb. Microarray-based comparative
  genomic hybridization arrayCGH in 49 intermediate-risk AML and RT-PCR-based screening
  in 532 AML cases allowed the detection of ins 21 8 ins 8 21 in three cases arrayCGH
  and subsequent RT-PCR revealed an  0.5 Mb sized inserted fragment generating the
  5RUNX1 3RUNX1T1 fusion gene in one case with a submicroscopic ins 21 8 q22 q22q22
  whereas the other two cases were identified by banding analysis and RT-PCR, respectively.
  Gene expression profiling GEP and a detailed review of the literature highlighted
  similar biological features of AML cases with ins 21 8 ins 8 21 and t 8 21 q22 q22
  . Our study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution array-based analysis and
  GEP and provides further evidence that AML with insertions generating the 5RUNX1
  3RUNX1T1 fusion not only biologically resemble the t 8 21 q22 q22 AML subgroup,
  but might also share its prognostically favorable clinical behavior. Thus, similar
  treatment options should be considered in these patients.
