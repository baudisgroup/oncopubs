abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL , the most common form of lymphoma in
  adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including
  germinal centre B-cell-like GCB and activated B-cell-like ABC DLBCL. Gene expression
  profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated
  with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except
  for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in
  these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a
  pathogenetic event. Here we show that amp gt 50 of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction
  of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative TNFAIP3,
  also called A20 and positive CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 TAK1 and TNFRSF11A RANK
  regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying
  enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected,
  with approximately 30 of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations
  and or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation
  of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor
  role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules
  with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate
  that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple
  genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to
  abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.
