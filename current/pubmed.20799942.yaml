abstract: A major challenge in the interpretation of genomic profiling data generated
  from breast cancer samples is the identification of driver genes as distinct from
  bystander genes which do not impact tumorigenesis. One way to assess the relative
  importance of alterations in the transcriptome profile is to combine parallel analyses
  that assess changes in the copy number alterations CNAs . This integrated analysis
  permits the identification of genes with altered expression that map within specific
  chromosomal regions which demonstrate copy number alterations, providing a mechanistic
  approach to identify the driver genes.
