abstract: 'We report the case of a 58-year-old man who presented with a squamous cell
  carcinoma pT1a G2 of the left vocal cord. Six months after histologically verified
  complete resection, the patient experienced an endolaryngeal and extralaryngeal
  local recurrence pT4 pN2b G2. We applied DNA flow cytometry FCM and comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH on both primary and recurrent tumor. The primary tumor
  and the endolaryngeal compartment of the relapse was an aneuploid cell clone with
  a FCM DNA index of 1.42 and 1.44, respectively. The extralaryngeal compartment showed
  a shift featuring a DNA index of 2.78. In the primary tumor and in both compartments
  of the recurrence there was an identical pattern of complex chromosomal imbalances
  as detected in CGH CGH karyotype: rev ish enh 8q24.2-q24.3, 10q26.1-q26.3, 11q24-q25,
  12q24.2-q23.33,X , dim 4q, 13q14.3-q31 , amp 1p36.1-p36.2 . Hence, the recurrence
  was not associated with further gains and losses of chromosomal material. However,
  in the anterior part of the recurrence, the aneuploid tumor cell genome had completely
  doubled, obviously due to endoreduplication. Immunohistochemical analysis of several
  cell-cycle regulators revealed altered expression of checkpoint proteins, pointing
  to a complex disturbance in cell-cycle regulation.'
