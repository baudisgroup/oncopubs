abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization serves as a screening test for regions
  of copy number changes in tumor genomes. We have applied the technique to map DNA
  gains and losses in 33 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast
  tumors 13 fibroadenomas and 10 diploid and 10 aneuploid carcinomas . No genomic
  imbalances were found in fibroadenomas. Recurrent findings in adenocarcinomas include
  copy number increases for chromosomes 1q 14 of 20 samples , 8q 10 of 20 , 17q 5
  of 20 , 6p 3 of 20 , 13q 3 of 20 , and 16p 3 of 20 , and copy number decreases for
  chromosomes 22 7 of 20 , 17p 6 of 20 , and 20 3 of 20 . Regional high level copy
  number increases were observed on chromosome bands 1q32, 8p11, 8q24, 10p, 11q13,
  12p, 12q15, 17q11-12, and 17q22-24. The majority of the samples were studied for
  gene amplification of c-myc, c-erbB2, cycD1, and int-2 by means of Southern blot
  analysis. The comparison with DNA ploidy measurements revealed a different distribution
  and a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations in aneuploid tumors
  than in diploid tumors and in fibroadenomas.
