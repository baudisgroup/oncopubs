abstract: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified PTCL, NOS with genomic
  aberrations has been shown to resemble lymphoma-type adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma
  ATLL in terms of its genomic aberration patterns, histopathology, and prognosis.
  We have shown recently that a majority of patients with acute-type ATLL have multiple
  subclones that were likely produced in lymph nodes. In this study, we analyzed whether
  PTCL, NOS with genomic aberrations also has multiple subclones as found in ATLL
  by means of high-resolution oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization CGH .
  Thirteen cases of PTCL, NOS were available for 44K high-resolution array CGH analysis.
  The results showed that 11 84.6 of the 13 cases had a log2 ratio imbalance, suggesting
  that multiple subclones exist in PTCL, NOS with genomic aberrations. In order to
  analyze the association between multiple subclones and prognosis, we used previous
  bacterial-artificial chromosome BAC array analyses for 29 cases and found that the
  existence of multiple subclones was associated with a poor prognosis P 0.0279 .
