abstract: Infection with H. pylori is important in the etiology of gastric cancer.
  Gastric cancer is infrequent in Africa, despite high frequencies of H. pylori infection,
  referred to as the African enigma. Variation in environmental and host factors influencing
  gastric cancer risk between different populations have been reported but little
  is known about the biological differences between gastric cancers from different
  geographic locations. We aim to study genomic instability patterns of gastric cancers
  obtained from patients from United Kingdom UK and South Africa SA , in an attempt
  to support the African enigma hypothesis at the biological level.
