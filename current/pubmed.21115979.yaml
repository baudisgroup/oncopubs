abstract: Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas MZLs have been divided into 3 distinct subtypes
  extranodal MZLs of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT type, nodal MZLs, and
  splenic MZLs . Nevertheless, the relationship between the subtypes is still unclear.
  We performed a comprehensive analysis of genomic DNA copy number changes in a very
  large series of MZL cases with the aim of addressing this question. Samples from
  218 MZL patients 25 nodal, 57 MALT, 134 splenic, and 2 not better specified MZLs
  were analyzed with the Affymetrix Human Mapping 250K SNP arrays, and the data combined
  with matched gene expression in 33 of 218 cases. MALT lymphoma presented significantly
  more frequently gains at 3p, 6p, 18p, and del 6q23 TNFAIP3 A20 , whereas splenic
  MZLs was associated with del 7q31 , del 8p . Nodal MZLs did not show statistically
  significant differences compared with MALT lymphoma while lacking the splenic MZLs-related
  7q losses. Gains of 3q and 18q were common to all 3 subtypes. del 8p was often present
  together with del 17p TP53 . Although del 17p did not determine a worse outcome
  and del 8p was only of borderline significance, the presence of both deletions had
  a highly significant negative impact on the outcome of splenic MZLs.
