abstract: DNA copy number changes were characterized by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in 18 breast cancer cell lines. In 5 of these, the results were comparable with
  those from the primary tumors of which the cell lines were established. All of the
  cell lines showed extensive DNA copy number changes, with a mean of 16.3 - 1.1 aberrations
  per sample range 7-26 . All of the cell lines had a gain at 8q22-qter. Other common
  gains of DNA sequences occurred at 1q31-32 89 , 20q12-q13.2 83 , 8q13 72 , 3q26.1-qter
  67 , 17q21-qter 67 5p14 61 , 6p22 56 , and 22pter-qter 50 . High-level amplifications
  were observed in all cell lines the most frequent minimal common regions were 8q24.1
  89 , 20q12 61 , 1q41 39 , and 20p11.2 28 . Losses were observed less frequently
  than gains and the minimal common regions of the most frequent losses were Xq11-q12
  56 , Xp11.2-pter 50 , 13q21 50 , 8p12-pter 44 , 4p13-p14 39 , 6q15-q22 39 , and
  18q11.2-qter 33 . Although the cell lines showed more DNA copy number changes than
  the primary tumors, all aberrations, except one found in a primary tumor, were always
  present in the corresponding cell line. High-level amplifications found both in
  primary tumors and cell lines were at 1q, 8q, 17q, and 20q. The DNA copy number
  changes detected in these cell lines can be valuable in investigation of tumor progression
  in vitro and for a more detailed mapping and isolation of genes implicated in breast
  cancer.
