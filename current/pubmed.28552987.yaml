abstract: Inhibition of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with atezolizumab can induce
  durable clinical benefit (DCB) in patients with metastatic urothelial cancers, including
  complete remissions in patients with chemotherapy refractory disease. Although mutation
  load and PD-L1 immune cell (IC) staining have been associated with response, they
  lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for clinical use. Thus, there is a need
  to evaluate the peripheral blood immune environment and to conduct detailed analyses
  of mutation load, predicted neoantigens, and immune cellular infiltration in tumors
  to enhance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of response and resistance.The
  goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the association of mutation load and predicted
  neoantigen load with therapeutic benefit and (2) determine whether intratumoral
  and peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) clonality inform clinical outcomes in
  urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab. We hypothesized that an elevated
  mutation load in combination with T cell clonal dominance among intratumoral lymphocytes
  prior to treatment or among peripheral T cells after treatment would be associated
  with effective tumor control upon treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy. We performed
  whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and T cell receptor sequencing
  (TCR-seq) of pretreatment tumor samples as well as TCR-seq of matched, serially
  collected peripheral blood, collected before and after treatment with atezolizumab.
  These parameters were assessed for correlation with DCB (defined as progression-free
  survival [PFS] >6 months), PFS, and overall survival (OS), both alone and in the
  context of clinical and intratumoral parameters known to be predictive of survival
  in this disease state. Patients with DCB displayed a higher proportion of tumor-infiltrating
  T lymphocytes (TIL) (n = 24, Mann-Whitney p = 0.047). Pretreatment peripheral blood
  TCR clonality below the median was associated with improved PFS (n = 29, log-rank
  p = 0.048) and OS (n = 29, log-rank p = 0.011). Patients with DCB also demonstrated
  more substantial expansion of tumor-associated TCR clones in the peripheral blood
  3 weeks after starting treatment (n = 22, Mann-Whitney p = 0.022). The combination
  of high pretreatment peripheral blood TCR clonality with elevated PD-L1 IC staining
  in tumor tissue was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes (n = 10, hazard
  ratio (HR) (mean) = 89.88, HR (median) = 23.41, 95% CI [2.43, 506.94], p(HR > 1)
  = 0.0014). Marked variations in mutation loads were seen with different somatic
  variant calling methodologies, which, in turn, impacted associations with clinical
  outcomes. Missense mutation load, predicted neoantigen load, and expressed neoantigen
  load did not demonstrate significant association with DCB (n = 25, Mann-Whitney
  p = 0.22, n = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.55, and n = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.29, respectively).
  Instead, we found evidence of time-varying effects of somatic mutation load on PFS
  in this cohort (n = 25, p = 0.044). A limitation of our study is its small sample
  size (n = 29), a subset of the patients treated on IMvigor 210 (NCT02108652). Given
  the number of exploratory analyses performed, we intend for these results to be
  hypothesis-generating.These results demonstrate the complex nature of immune response
  to checkpoint blockade and the compelling need for greater interrogation and data
  integration of both host and tumor factors. Incorporating these variables in prospective
  studies will facilitate identification and treatment of resistant patients.
