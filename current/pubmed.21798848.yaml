abstract: 'Central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor CNS PNET and pineoblastoma
  are highly malignant embryonal brain tumors with poor prognoses. Current therapies
  are based on the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma, even though these tumors
  are distinct at both the anatomical and molecular level. CNS PNET and pineoblastoma
  have a worse clinical outcome than medulloblastoma thus, improved therapies based
  on an understanding of the underlying biology of CNS PNET and pineoblastoma are
  needed. To this end, we characterized the genomic alterations of 36 pediatric CNS
  PNETs and 8 pineoblastomas using Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.
  Overall, the majority of CNS PNETs contained a greater degree of genomic imbalance
  than pineoblastomas, with gain of 19p 8 27.6 of 29 , 2p 7 24.1 of 29 , and 1q 6
  20.7 of 29 common events in primary CNS PNETs. Novel gene copy number alterations
  were identified and corroborated by Genomic Identification of Significant Targets
  In Cancer GISTIC analysis: gain of PCDHGA3, 5q31.3 in 62.1 of primary CNS PNETs
  and all primary pineoblastomas and FAM129A, 1q25 in 55.2 of primary CNS PNETs and
  50 of primary pineoblastomas. Comparison of our GISTIC data with publically available
  data for medulloblastoma confirmed these CNS PNET-specific copy number alterations.
  With use of the collection of 5 primary and recurrent CNS PNET pairs, we found that
  gain of 2p21 was maintained at relapse in 80 of cases. Novel gene copy number losses
  included OR4C12, 11p11.12 in 48.2 of primary CNS PNETs and 50 of primary pineoblastomas.
  Loss of CDKN2A B 9p21.3 was identified in 14 of primary CNS PNETs and was significantly
  associated with older age among children P .05 . CADPS, 3p14.2 was lost in 27.6
  of primary CNS PNETs and was associated with poor prognosis P .043 . This genome-wide
  analysis revealed the marked molecular heterogeneity of CNS PNETs and enabled the
  identification of novel genes and clinical associations potentially involved in
  the pathogenesis of these tumors.'
