abstract: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL is not a sharply delineated lymphoma entity,
  either morphologically, phenotypically, or clinically. The diagnosis is often made
  by excluding other small cell lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation, thus a
  genetic diagnostic marker would be of great benefit. Conventional cytogenetic techniques
  have previously demonstrated a deletion of 6q in a proportion of cases, varying
  from 7 to 55 . In this report, we apply array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  on 11 LPL samples. Genomic aberrations were detected in 9 of 11 cases, and included
  gains and losses. In general, the number of genetic aberrations was relatively low
  two to three abnormalities per case . Recurrent aberrations detected were deletion
  of 6q two cases , deletion of chromosome 17 two cases , gain of 3q two cases , and
  gain of chromosome 7 two cases . This report not only confirms the reported loss
  of 6q in a proportion of cases but also highlights the genetic heterogeneity of
  LPL, in accordance with the known immunophenotypical, morphological, and clinical
  diversity of the disease.
