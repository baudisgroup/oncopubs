abstract: Analysis of ovarian carcinomas has shown that karyotypes are often highly
  abnormal and cannot be identified with certainty by conventional cytogenetic methods.
  In this study, 17 tumors derived from 13 patients were analyzed by a combination
  of spectral karyotyping SKY , comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and expression
  microarrays. Within the study group, a total of 396 chromosomal rearrangements could
  be identified by SKY and CGH analysis. When the distribution of aberrations was
  normalized with respect to relative genomic length, chromosomes 3, 8, 11, 17, and
  21 had the highest frequencies. Parallel microarray expression studies of 1718 human
  cDNAs were used to analyze expression profiles and to determine whether correlating
  gene expression with chromosomal rearrangement would identify smaller subsets of
  differentially expressed genes. Within the entire set of samples, microarray expression
  analysis grouped together poorly differentiated tumors irrespective of histological
  subtype. For three patients, a comparison between genomic alterations and gene expression
  pattern was performed on samples of primary and metastatic tumors. Their common
  origin was demonstrated by the close relationship of both the SKY and CGH karyotypes
  and the observed profiles of gene expression. In agreement with the pattern of genomic
  imbalance observed for chromosome 3 in ovarian cancer, the relative expression profile
  with respect to a normal ovary exhibited a contiguous pattern of reduced expression
  of genes mapping to the 3p25.5-3p21.31 and increased expression of genes from 3q13.33-3q28.
  This study demonstrates that SKY, CGH, and microarray analysis can in combination
  identify significantly smaller subsets of differentially expressed genes for future
  studies.
