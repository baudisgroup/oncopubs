abstract: DNA sequence copy number changes were studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH along all chromosomes in 58 samples of malignant fibrous histiocytoma MFH .
  The material consisted of 43 primary tumors 9 of myxoid and 34 of storiform-pleomorphic
  subtype , 13 local recurrences 2 myxoid and 11 storiform-pleomorphic , and 2 metastases
  1 myxoid and 1 storiform-pleomorphic . Genetic aberrations, with a mean of 5.5 changes
  per sample range, 0 to 22 , were detected in 47 of 58 samples 81 . The minimal common
  regions of the most frequent gains were 1p31 33 , 9q31 29 , 5p14-pter 26 , 7q32
  24 , and 7p15-pter 22 . High-level amplifications were detected in 16 of the 58
  samples 28 . High-level amplification of 13q31-qter was seen in four tumors 7 other
  high-level amplifications were more sporadic. Losses of DNA sequences were less
  frequent than gains. The minimal common regions of the most common losses were 13q21
  21 and 13q22 21 . Statistically significant correlation was found between gain of
  7q32 and the rates of worse metastasis-free survival P 0.01 and overall survival
  P 0.004 . The gain of 7q32 retained its prognostic significance also in a multivariate
  analysis with tumor size and grade. Gain of 1p31 was associated with a trend to
  decreased overall survival. Gains of 5p14-pter and 9q31 and losses of 13q21 and
  or 13q22 did not have any prognostic value neither did the total number of aberrations,
  total number of gains, or total number of losses per sample.
