abstract: Cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies of glioblastoma multiforme GBM
  have shown that the most frequent alterations are gains of chromosome 7, losses
  of 9p loci and chromosome 10, and gene amplification, primarily of the epidermal
  growth factor receptor EGFR gene. Although this profile is potentially useful in
  distinguishing GBM from other tumor types, the techniques used tend to be labor
  intensive, and some can detect only gains or losses of genetic loci. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH is a powerful technique capable of identifying both gains
  and losses of DNA sequences. The present study compares the CGH evaluation of 22
  GBM with classic cytogenetics, loss of heterozygosity by allelotyping, and gene
  amplification by Southern blot analysis to determine the reliability of CGH in the
  genetic characterization of GBM. The CGH and karyotypic data were consistent in
  showing gain of chromosome 7 accompanied by a loss of chromosome 10 as the most
  frequent abnormality, followed by a loss of 9p in 17 of 22 GBM cases. Loss of heterozygosity
  of chromosomes 10 19 22 and 9p 9 22 loci confirmed the underrepresentation by CGH.
  Genomic amplifications were observed by CGH in 5 of the 10 cases where gene amplification
  was detected by Southern blot analysis. The data show that CGH is equally reliable,
  compared with the more established genetic methods, for recognizing the prominent
  genetic alterations associated with GBM and support its use as a plausible adjunct
  to glioma classification.
