abstract: Currently, two main technologies are used for screening of DNA copy number
  the BAC Bacterial Artificial Chromosome and the recently developed oligonucleotide-based
  CGH Chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization arrays which are capable of detecting
  small genomic regions with amplification or deletion. The correlation as well as
  the discriminative power of these platforms has never been compared statistically
  on a significant set of human patient samples.
