abstract: Aberrant expression of RNA-binding proteins has profound implications for
  cellular physiology and the pathogenesis of human diseases such as cancer. We previously
  identified the Fragile X-Related 1 gene (FXR1) as one amplified candidate driver
  gene at 3q26-29 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). FXR1 is an autosomal paralog
  of Fragile X mental retardation 1 and has not been directly linked to human cancers.
  Here we demonstrate that FXR1 is a key regulator of tumor progression and its overexpression
  is critical for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
  We identified the mechanisms by which FXR1 executes its regulatory function by forming
  a novel complex with two other oncogenes, protein kinase C, iota and epithelial
  cell transforming 2, located in the same amplicon via distinct binding mechanisms.
  FXR1 expression is a candidate biomarker predictive of poor survival in multiple
  solid tumors including NSCLCs. Because FXR1 is overexpressed and associated with
  poor clinical outcomes in multiple cancers, these results have implications for
  other solid malignancies.
