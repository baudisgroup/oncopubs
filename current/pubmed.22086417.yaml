abstract: 'Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma NSHL is a distinct, highly heritable
  Hodgkin lymphoma subtype. We undertook a genome-wide meta-analysis of 393 European-origin
  adolescent young adult NSHL patients and 3315 controls using the Illumina Human610-Quad
  Beadchip and Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. We identified 3 single
  nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs on chromosome 6p21.32 that were significantly associated
  with NSHL risk: rs9268542 P 5.35 10 -10 , rs204999 P 1.44 10 -9 , and rs2858870
  P 1.69 10 -8 . We also confirmed a previously reported association in the same region,
  rs6903608 P 3.52 10 -10 . rs204999 and rs2858870 were weakly correlated r 2 0.257
  , and the remaining pairs of SNPs were not correlated r 2 amp lt 0.1 . In an independent
  set of 113 NSHL cases and 214 controls, 2 SNPs were significantly associated with
  NSHL and a third showed a comparable odds ratio OR . These SNPs are found on 2 haplotypes
  associated with NSHL risk rs204999-rs9268528-rs9268542-rs6903608-rs2858870 AGGCT,
  OR 1.7, P 1.71 10 -6 GAATC, OR 0.4, P 1.16 10 -4 . All individuals with the GAATC
  haplotype also carried the HLA class II DRB1 0701 allele. In a separate analysis,
  the DRB1 0701 allele was associated with a decreased risk of NSHL OR 0.5, 95 confidence
  interval 0.4, 0.7 . These data support the importance of the HLA class II region
  in NSHL etiology.'
