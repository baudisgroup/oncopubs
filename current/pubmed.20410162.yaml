abstract: Pheochromocytomas and abdominal paragangliomas are adrenal and extra-adrenal
  catecholamine-producing tumours. They arise due to heritable cancer syndromes, or
  more frequently occur sporadically due to an unknown genetic cause. The majority
  of cases are benign, but malignant tumours are observed. Previous comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and loss of heterozygosity studies have shown frequent deletions
  of chromosome arms 1p, 3q and 22q in pheochromocytomas. We applied high-resolution
  whole-genome array CGH on 53 benign and malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas
  to narrow down candidate regions as well as to identify chromosomal alterations
  more specific to malignant tumours. Minimal overlapping regions MORs were identified
  on 16 chromosomes, with the most frequent MORs of deletion amp gt or 32 occurring
  on chromosome arms 1p, 3q, 11p q, 17p and 22q, while the chromosome arms 1q, 7p,
  12q and 19p harboured the most common MORs of gain amp gt or 14 . The most frequent
  MORs 61-75 in the pheochromocytomas were identified at 1p, and the four regions
  of common losses encompassed 1p36, 1p32-31, 1p22-21 and 1p13. Tumours that did not
  show 1p loss generally demonstrated aberrations on chromosome 11. Gain of chromosomal
  material was significantly more frequent among the malignant cases. Moreover, gain
  at 19q, trisomy 12 and loss at 11q were positively associated with malignant pheochromocytomas,
  while 1q gain was commonly observed in the malignant paragangliomas. Our study revealed
  novel and narrow recurrent chromosomal regions of loss and gain at several autosomes,
  a prerequisite for identifying candidate tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes involved
  in the development of adrenal and extra-adrenal catecholamine-producing tumours.
