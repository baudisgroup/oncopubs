abstract: Currently there is a lack of objective markers that can reliably differentiate
  benign and malignant follicular thyroid tumours. Such markers are needed to avoid
  the morbidity and cost of diagnosing these lesions by a thyroid lobectomy and then
  a second operation to remove the remaining half of thyroid if cancer is found. The
  aim of this research was to look for genomic markers that might solve this important
  problem. Ethical approval for the project was obtained. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded specimens and copy number analysed using an in-house produced
  1-megabase genomic array by comparative genomic hybridization 1Mb-aCGH . Acceptable
  quality data were obtained in 25 26 96 of adenomas and 17 28 61 of carcinomas. Among
  the carcinomas, 11 were minimally invasive MI , 5 widely invasive WI and there was
  one metastasis. Recurrent copy number changes distinguishing benign and malignant
  included 1p34.2-36.33, 1q, 13q12.11-14.3, 14q22.1-32.33, 20q and -22. 20q became
  more sensitive 36.4 for MI carcinomas, whereas 13q12.11-14.3 and 14q22.1-32.33 became
  more sensitive 66.7 for identifying WI cancers from adenomas. Only in the context
  of aneuploidy 3 adenomas, 3 MI, 3 WI there were some specific copy number changes
  that could differentiate all aneuploid adenomas from carcinomas. This research is
  the first using 1Mb-aCGH to study benign and malignant follicular thyroid tumours.
  Overall, the incidence of any copy number changes is low, but there are a number
  of changes associated with different tumour types. Further research with a larger
  sample and better quality DNA will clarify these findings.
