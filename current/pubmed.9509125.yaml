abstract: 'Cytogenetic studies have demonstrated that oral squamous cell carcinomas
  OSCCs are usually characterised by complex karyotypes with many marker chromosomes.
  We analysed the genetic changes of six OSCC cell cultures by comparative genomic
  hybridisation CGH . The CGH technique provides information on chromosomal gains
  and losses of the whole tumour genome in a single experiment and can therefore identify
  regions that harbour putative tumour suppressor genes in the case of loss of chromosomal
  material or oncogenes in the case of gain or amplification of chromosomal material
  . Recurrent losses were detected at chromosome arms Xp and 3p four cases . Gains
  consistently occurred at chromosome arms 8q and 9q four cases and at 1q, 3q, 5p,
  7p, and 9p three cases . The same six tumour cultures have previously been analysed
  by classical karyotyping. An important discrepancy between the two techniques was
  the number of losses detected: 55 with karyotyping versus 26 with CGH. On the basis
  of the cytogenetic complexity of these tumours and on FISH experiments that confirmed
  the CGH results, we conclude that genetic changes, particularly losses, can be more
  reliably detected by CGH analysis.'
