abstract: The genetic changes in marginal zone B cell lymphomas MZBCL vary according
  to the anatomical region. This study aimed to investigate genomic aberrations in
  ocular MZBCL and to compare them with those of tumors from other anatomical sites.
  The study population comprised 24 cases of primary ocular MZBCL, 11 pulmonary MZBCL,
  and seven nodal MZBCL. For array CGH, fresh tumor tissues were analyzed with a genome-wide
  scanning array containing 2,304 BAC PAC clones which cover the whole human genome
  at a resolution of 1.3 Mb. FISH analysis for MALT1 gene alteration was performed
  for ocular and nodal MZBCL and RT-PCR for the detection of API2-MALT1 transcripts
  was performed for pulmonary MZBCL. The recurrent genomic alterations in ocular MZBCL
  were losses of chromosome bands 6q23.3 9 24, 38 , 7q36.3 2 24, 8 , and 13q34 2 24,
  8 , and gains of chromosomes 3 9 24, 38 , and 15 4 24, 16 , and chromosome arms
  18q 4 24, 16 , and 6p 2 24, 8 . The t 11 18 q21 q21 was not detected. The genomic
  alterations of pulmonary MZBCL included recurrent loss of 18q21 2 11, 19 . A t 11
  18 q21 q21 fusion transcript was detected in five out of eight cases 63 . Nodal
  MZBCL showed neither recurrent genome alterations nor any change in MALT1 gene copy
  number. In conclusion, the array CGH profile of ocular MZBCL is distinct from those
  of pulmonary and nodal MZBCL. Deletion of chromosome band 6q23.3 in ocular MZBCL
  is a novel finding and may constitute a crucial genetic alteration in the pathogenesis
  of ocular MZBCL.
