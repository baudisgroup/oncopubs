abstract: It has been shown that refractory hyperparathyroidism HPT correlates biologically
  with a monoclonal true neoplasm, but the chromosomal changes and their relationship
  with biochemical variables such as high levels of phosphate, low levels of calcium
  Ca , and calcitriol deficiency are still in need of a deeper analysis.
