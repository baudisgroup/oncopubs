abstract: Glioblastoma GBM remains a highly lethal neoplasm, refractory to current
  therapies. The molecular genetic aberrations most closely related to clinical aggressiveness
  in GBM have been difficult to identify, perhaps due in part to the short survival
  range observed in cohorts of GBM patients. To address this, we characterized 39
  tumors from rare patients 2-5 of all GBM cases who experienced long-term survival
  amp gt 3 years using comparative genomic hybridization as a genome-wide screen.
  We then compared the frequency and type of aberrations with those in tumors from
  24 typical or short-term survivors STSs amp lt 1.5 years . Losses of 9p and 10 and
  simple gains of chromosome 7 showed at least trends toward increased frequency in
  the STS group. Additional aberrations, including loss of 6q and gains of 19q and
  20q, were significantly more frequent in the STS group. The presence of 19q loss
  was exclusive to the long-term survivor LTS group. Multivariate analyses indicated
  that 6q loss, 10q loss, and 19q gain were associated with short-term survival all
  P amp lt 0.01 . The combination of any two of these three aberrations was seen in
  16 of 24 STSs but only 1 of 39 LTSs. This comparison of rare LTSs with STSs typical
  GBM survivors identified 6q loss, 10q loss, and 19q gain, particularly when two
  or more of these were present, as most closely associated with aggressive clinical
  behavior in GBM. Loss of 19q may be a marker of long-term survival.
