abstract: We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to identify recurrent chromosomal
  imbalances in tumor DNA from 25 malignant ovarian carcinomas and two ovarian tumors
  of low malignant potential LMP . Many of the carcinoma specimens displayed numerous
  imbalances. The most common sites of copy number increases, in order of frequency,
  were 8q24.1, 20q13.2-qter, 3q26.3-qter, 1q32, 20p, 9p21-pter, and 12p. DNA amplification
  was identified in 12 carcinomas 48 . The most frequent sites of amplification were
  8q24.1-24.2, 3q26.3, and 20q13.2-qter. Other recurrent sites of amplification included
  7q36, 17q25, and 19q13.1-13.2. The most frequent sites of copy number decreases
  were 5q21, 9q, 17p, 17q12-21, 4q26-31, 16q, and 22q. Underrepresentation of 17p
  was observed in six of 16 stage III IV tumors, but in none of seven stage I II tumors,
  suggesting that this change may be a late event associated with the transition of
  ovarian carcinomas to a more metastatic disease. Overrepresentation of 3q26.3-qter,
  5p14-pter, 8q24.1, 9p21-pter, 20p, and 20q13.2-qter and underrepresentation of 4q26-31
  and 17q12-21 also tended to be more common in advanced-stage tumors. All ten grade
  3 tumors had copy number increases involving 8q24.1, compared to only three of nine
  grade 2 tumors. Overrepresentation of 3q26.3-qter and 20q13.2-qter was also observed
  at a higher frequency in high-grade tumors. One of the two LMP tumors displayed
  chromosomal alterations, which consisted of overrepresentation of 5p and 9p only.
  Taken collectively, these findings and data from other CGH studies of ovarian cancers
  define a set of small chromosome segments that are consistently over- or underrepresented
  and, thus, highlight sites of putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that
  contribute to the pathogenesis of these highly malignant neoplasms.
