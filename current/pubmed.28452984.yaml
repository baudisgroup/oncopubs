abstract: Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved the
  prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the ability of TKIs to eradicate CML
  remains uncertain and patients must continue TKI therapy for indefinite periods.
  In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations
  in 24 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML who were registered in the
  JALSG CML212 study. We identified 191 somatic mutations other than the BCR-ABL1
  fusion gene (median 8, range 1-17). Age, hemoglobin concentration and white blood
  cell counts were correlated with the number of mutations. Patients with mutations
  â©¾6 showed higher rate of achieving major molecular response than those<6 (P=0.0381).
  Mutations in epigenetic regulator, ASXL1, TET2, TET3, KDM1A and MSH6 were found
  in 25% of patients. TET2 or TET3, AKT1 and RUNX1 were mutated in one patient each.
  ASXL1 was mutated within exon 12 in three cases. Mutated genes were significantly
  enriched with cell signaling and cell division pathways. Furthermore, DNA copy number
  analysis showed that 2 of 24 patients had uniparental disomy of chromosome 1p or
  3q, which disappeared major molecular response was achieved. These mutations may
  play significant roles in CML pathogenesis in addition to the strong driver mutation
  BCR-ABL1.
