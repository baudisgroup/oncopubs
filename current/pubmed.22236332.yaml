abstract: Molecular characterization of tumour cell lines is increasingly regarded
  as a prerequisite for defining their validity as models of in vivo neoplasia. We
  present the first comprehensive catalogue of genomic and transcriptional characteristics
  of five widely used canine lymphoid tumour cell lines. High-resolution microarray-based
  comparative genomic hybridization defined their unique profiles of genomic DNA copy
  number imbalance. Multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization identified aberrant
  gains of MYC, KIT and FLT3 and deletions of PTEN and CDKN2 in individual cell lines,
  and also revealed examples of extensive structural chromosome reorganization. Gene
  expression profiling and RT-PCR analyses defined the relationship between genomic
  imbalance and transcriptional dysregulation in each cell line, clarifying their
  relevance as models of discrete functional pathways with biological and therapeutic
  significance. In combination, these data provide an extensive resource of molecular
  data for directing the appropriate use of these cell lines as tools for studying
  canine lymphoid neoplasia.
