abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used in a retrospective analysis
  of chromosomal imbalances in frozen primary tumor specimens from 14 endometrial
  carcinoma patients. Chromosome changes were detected in nine cases 64 , and tumor
  stage and grade tended to parallel the degree of genomic imbalances. Gain of the
  entire long arm of chromosome 1 was observed in six cases 43 , three of which displayed
  only this chromosome change. Other common sites of copy number increases included
  8q21-- amp gt qter 4 cases , 10p15 4 cases , 10q11-- amp gt q24 3 cases , and 13q21--
  amp gt qter 3 cases, each with stage III disease . Two of the tumors with gains
  of chromosome 10 involved the whole chromosome, and this was the sole abnormality
  in one case. DNA amplification at 5p14-- amp gt p15 was identified in one specimen,
  a stage III tumor having numerous imbalances. DNA microsatellite analysis revealed
  multiple replication errors RER , indicative of the RER phenotype, in four of 13
  31 cases evaluated. The RER phenotype was observed in four of six stage la tumors
  but in none of seven stage Ib or stage III tumors. Multiple genomic imbalances detected
  by CGH were not observed in RER tumors but were detected in five of nine tumors
  without the RER phenotype. These investigations demonstrate the feasibility of CGH
  for the retrospective assessment of chromosomal changes in endometrial carcinoma
  specimens. Moreover, these data suggest that the etiologies in tumors with and without
  the RER phenotype may differ.
