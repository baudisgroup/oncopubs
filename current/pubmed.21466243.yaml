abstract: Childhood pilocytic astrocytoma is the most frequent brain tumor affecting
  children. Proteomics analysis is currently considered a powerful tool for global
  evaluation of protein expression and has been widely applied in the field of cancer
  research. In the present study, a series of proteomics, genomics, and bioinformatics
  approaches were employed to identify, classify and characterize the proteome content
  of low-grade brain tumors as it appears in early childhood. Through bioinformatics
  database construction, protein profiles generated from pathological tissue samples
  were compared against profiles of normal brain tissues. Additionally, experiments
  of comparative genomic hybridization arrays were employed to monitor for genetic
  aberrations and sustain the interpretation and evaluation of the proteomic data.
  The current study confirms the dominance of MAPK pathway for the childhood pilocytic
  astrocytoma occurrence and novel findings regarding the ERK-2 expression are reported.
