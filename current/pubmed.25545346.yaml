abstract: Phaeochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neural crest-derived
  tumours originating from adrenal chromaffin cells or extra-adrenal sympathetic and
  parasympathetic tissues. More than a third of PCC/PGL cases are associated with
  heritable syndromes involving 13 or more known genes. These genes have been broadly
  partitioned into two groups based on pseudo-hypoxic and receptor tyrosine kinase
  (RTK) signalling pathways. Many of these genes can also become somatically mutated,
  although up to one third of sporadic cases have no known genetic driver. Furthermore,
  little is known of the genes that co-operate with known driver genes to initiate
  and drive tumourigenesis. To explore the genomic landscape of PCC/PGL, we applied
  exome sequencing, high-density SNP-array analysis, and RNA sequencing to 36 PCCs
  and four functional PGL tumours. All tumours displayed low mutation frequency, in
  contrast to frequent large segmental copy-number alterations, aneuploidy, and evidence
  for chromothripsis in one case. Multi-region sampling of one benign familial PCC
  tumour provided evidence for the timing of mutations during tumourigenesis and ongoing
  clonal evolution. Thirty-one of 40 (77.5%) cases could be explained by germline
  or somatic mutations or structural alterations affecting known PCC/PGL genes. Deleterious
  somatic mutations were also identified in known tumour-suppressor genes associated
  with genome maintenance and epigenetic modulation. A multitude of other genes were
  also found mutated that are likely important for normal neuroendocrine cell function.
  We revisited the gene-expression subtyping of PCC/PGL by integrating published microarray
  data with our RNA-seq data, enabling the identification of six robust gene-expression
  subtypes. The majority of cases in our cohort with no identifiable driver mutation
  were classified into a gene-expression subtype bearing similarity to MAX mutant
  PCC/PGL. Our data suggest there are yet unknown PCC/PGL cancer genes that can phenocopy
  MAX mutant PCC/PGL tumours. This study provides new insight into the molecular diversity
  and genetic origins of PCC/PGL tumours.
