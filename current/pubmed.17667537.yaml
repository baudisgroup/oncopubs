abstract: 'Thymic carcinomas are rare malignant neoplasms which comprise several histologic
  subtypes. Adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC is included among these subtypes even if
  it has never been formally reported. We evaluated the clinical, radiologic, morphologic,
  immunohistochemical, and genetic features of 4 cases of thymic neoplasms with ACC-like
  features retrieved from the authors consult files. Most cases affected adult elderly
  males mean 68.5 y range: 63 to 77 y M:F ratio 3:1 , and were asymptomatic. The clinical
  history no evidence of ACC in other sites , radiologic findings a mass in the thymic
  region , and morphologic features residual thymic tissue at the periphery of the
  neoplasm strongly supported their primary thymic nature. Grossly, most of the tumors
  presented as multicystic lesions. On microscopic examination there were true glandular
  spaces filled with periodic acid-Schiff material, and pseudocysts containing stromal
  mucin, collagen IV, and laminin. Features favoring malignancy were overtly infiltrative
  margins 2 4 , mitotic figures 2 4 , cytologic atypia 1 4 , vascular invasion 1 4
  , absence of organoid thymuslike pattern 4 4 , and absence of immature TdT T lymphocytes
  3 3 . Necrosis and nerve invasion were not observed. The tumor cells showed the
  following immunophenotype: p63 3 3 , CK34betaE12 3 3 , CD5 in scattered cells 1
  3 , CD117- 3 3 , chromogranin- 2 2 , synaptophysin- 2 2 , and CD56- 2 2 . MIB-1
  ranged from 1 to 10 . Comparative genomic hybridization revealed an isolated gain
  of chromosome 8 in 1 3 cases. One patient is alive and well after 20 months, 1 died
  of another cause 5 years later, and 2 were lost at follow-up. Exceptionally, primary
  thymic tumors may exhibit histologic features resembling those of ACC of salivary
  glands. They may be well circumscribed and cytologically bland or invasive and cytologically
  atypical. In either case they lack an organoid thymuslike pattern and immature T
  lymphocytes. We have interpreted them as a microscopic subtype of well-differentiated
  thymic carcinoma of low-grade malignancy, an impression supported by the admittedly
  limited follow-up information.'
