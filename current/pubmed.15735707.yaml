abstract: In neuroblastoma, the most frequent genetic alterations are unbalanced translocations
  involving chromosome 17. To gain insights into these rearrangements, we have characterized
  a previously identified der 1 t 1 17 of the CLB-Bar cell line. The 17q breakpoint
  was mapped by FISH. Subsequently, a rearranged fragment was identified by Southern
  analysis, cloned in a lambda vector and sequenced. The chromosome rearrangement
  is more complex than expected due to the presence of an interstitial 4p telomeric
  sequence between chromosome 1p and 17q. Three different genes, which may play a
  role in neuroblastoma development, are disrupted by the translocation breakpoints.
  Indeed, the 3UTR of the PIP5K2B gene on chromosome 17q is directly fused to the
  TTAGGG n repeat of the chromosome 4p telomere, and the 1 4 fusion disrupts the MACF1
  microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1 and POLN genes, respectively. Interestingly,
  the 1 4 fusion was present at diagnosis and at relapse, whereas the 4 17 fusion
  was detected at relapse only, leading to a secondary 17q gain confirmed by array
  CGH therefore indicating that 17q gain may not be a primary event in neuroblastoma.
  Finally, screening of a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines identified interstitial
  telomeric sequences in three other cases, suggesting that this may be a recurrent
  mechanism leading to unbalanced translocations in neuroblastoma.
