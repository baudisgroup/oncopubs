abstract: In contrast to other subtypes of lymphoproliferative malignancies, the genetic
  mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of hairy cell leukemia HCL are unknown. We
  studied densely infiltrated splenic tissue of 14 cases of HCL for the presence of
  chromosomal gains and losses by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Chromosomal
  imbalances were detected in only four of the 14 cases. Chromosomal gains involved
  the regions 5q13-q31 two cases and 1p32-p36.2 one case . A loss of the region 11q14-q22
  was found in one additional patient. The imbalances affecting the regions 5q and
  11q were confirmed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH using PAC
  clone 144G9 5q31 and YAC clones 755B11 11q22.3-q23.1 and 801E11 11q22.3-q23.1 spanning
  the ATM gene and occurred in 61 to 75 of analyzed nuclei. The latter DNA probes
  and probes hybridizing to chromosomal regions, which are frequently deleted in other
  subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas NHL , namely 9p21 P16 INK4A , 13q14 D13S25, and
  17p13 P53 were subsequently applied to all 14 cases of HCL, but no additional abnormalities
  were found. We conclude that overrepresentation of chromosome 5 represents a recurrent
  aberration in HCL and that the commonly overrepresented region resides in 5q13-q31.
  Chromosomal imbalances including deletions of the tumor suppressor gene loci 9p21
  P16 INK4A , 13q14 D13S25, and 17p13 P53 rarely occur in HCL in contrast to some
  other subtypes of B-cell NHL. The pathogenetic role of 11q ATM alterations in HCL
  remains to be determined.
