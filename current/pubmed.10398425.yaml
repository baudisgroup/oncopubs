abstract: 'The aims of the present study were to compare genetic aberrations in primary
  sarcomas and their pulmonary metastases and to explore the pathways associated with
  disease spreading. The primary tumor and its subsequent pulmonary metastasis of
  22 patients were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. All samples were
  obtained before the initiation of chemo- or radiotherapy. The mean total number
  of aberrations per tumor was 7.6 range, 0-17 in primary tumors and 7. 5 range, 0-19
  in metastases. The mean numbers of high-level amplifications per tumor were similar
  0.32 in primary tumors and 0. 36 in metastases . The frequencies of the most common
  aberrations were relatively similar in primary tumors and metastases: the most frequent
  gain affected 1q minimal common regions 1q21-q23 in 36 of primary tumors and 1q21
  in 45 of metastases . The most frequent losses were detected at 9p 9p22-pter in
  32 of primary tumors and 9p21-pter in 32 of metastases , 10p 10p11.2-p12 in 41 of
  primary tumors and 10p11.2-pter in 32 of metastases , 11q 11q23-qter in 36 of primary
  tumors and 32 of metastases , and 13q 13q14-q21 in 45 of primary tumors and 50 of
  metastases . No aberrations specific to metastases were detected. An increase in
  the total number of changes during progression was a predominant feature in a majority
  of these paired samples. Also, the number of differences in the genetic profile
  outnumbered common changes in a majority of the samples. However, despite the heterogeneous
  and numerous changes, all pairs with aberrations in both specimens had some shared
  alterations in both samples. Genes Chromosomes Cancer 25:323-331, 1999.'
