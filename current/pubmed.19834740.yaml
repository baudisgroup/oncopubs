abstract: We have demonstrated that overexpression of osteopontin OPN could contribute
  to metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC , and that OPN-positive cancer cells
  are often localized in the periphery of cancer nodules adjacent to stromal cells.
  This study was to identify the difference of intratumor genomic aberrations between
  OPN-positive and OPN-negative HCC cells.
