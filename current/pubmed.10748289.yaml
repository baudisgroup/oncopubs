abstract: 'Sequential changes of chromosomal copy number were analyzed retrospectively
  in five diffuse-type gastric cancer cell lines by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , DNA cytometry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH with centromeric
  and painting probes. By CGH, we found loss of 18q21 in all of the cell lines and
  gains of 7p11-q31, 20q, and 22 in four of the five cell lines. Actual copy numbers
  of chromosomes 7 and 18 were determined by FISH: disomy 18 with partial loss of
  18q in the two DNA-diploid cell lines AGS and MKN-45 , trisomy 7 in MKN-45, disomy
  18 and tetrasomy 7 with one-copy loss of 7p and one-copy gain of 7q tip in DNA-triploid
  HSC-39 40A, and trisomy 18 and hexasomy 7 with one-copy loss of 7q in DNA-tetraploid
  KATO-III. Because the DNA aneuploidy is thought to result through tetraploidization,
  and the duplicated chromosomal changes in DNA aneuploid tumors seem to precede tetraploidization,
  the duplicated gain of chromosome 7 and one-copy loss of 7q in KATO-III were inferred
  to have occurred before and after tetraploidization, respectively. Similarly, HSC-39
  40A were inferred to be preceded by the DNA-diploid stage with disomy 7 and monosomy
  18. As the loss of 18q21 and the gain of 7p11-q31 were inferred to have occurred
  already in the DNA diploid stage in at least four and two of the cell lines, respectively,
  the 18q21 loss may be more important than the 7q gain as an earlier event in the
  genesis of diffuse-type stomach cancer. The combined CGH, FISH, and ploidy analyses
  thus give us a clue to extract important earlier events from the chromosomal changes
  that were screened by CGH alone.'
