abstract: Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma ATLL is the neoplasm caused by human T-cell
  leukemia virus type 1 HTLV-1 . We performed oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH against paired samples comprising peripheral blood PB and lymph node LN samples
  from 13 patients with acute ATLL. We found that the genome profiles of the PB frequently
  differed from those of the LN samples. The results showed that 9 of 13 cases investigated
  had a log2 ratio imbalance among chromosomes, and that chromosome imbalances were
  more frequent in LN samples. Detailed analysis revealed that the imbalances were
  likely caused by the presence of multiple subclones in the LN samples. Five of 13
  cases showed homozygous loss regions in PB samples, which were not found in the
  LN samples, indicating that tumors in the PB were derived from LN subclones in most
  cases. Southern blot analysis of TCR showed that these multiple subclones originated
  from a common clone. We concluded that in many ATLL cases, multiple subclones in
  the LNs originate from a common clone, and that a selected subclone among the LN
  subclones appears in the PB.
