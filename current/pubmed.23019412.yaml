abstract: Inflammatory leiomyosarcoma (ILMS) is a soft tissue tumor that morphologically
  resembles conventional leiomyosarcoma (LMS) admixed with a prominent inflammatory
  infiltrate. Genetic data on ILMS are still limited but have suggested that this
  entity is characterized by hyperhaploidy (24-34 chromosomes). This low chromosome
  number is otherwise uncommon in neoplasia and has been found only in 0.2% to 0.3%
  of cytogenetically investigated tumors. Here, three ILMS were investigated using
  cytogenetic, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and global gene expression
  analyses. All cases displayed a hyperhaploid origin. Combined with previously reported
  cases, hyperhaploidy has been found in six of seven cytogenetically investigated
  ILMS. The copy number distribution of individual chromosomes is clearly nonrandom;
  the hyperhaploid clones of all six cases displayed disomy for chromosomes 5 and
  20, and two copies of chromosomes 18, 21, and 22 were also common. All chromosomes
  identified as disomic showed a biparental origin by SNP array analysis; whether
  this is of pathogenetic importance is not known. Compared with conventional LMS,
  ILMS had a distinct gene expression signature. Furthermore, the number of chromosome
  copies correlated well with gene expression levels; disomic chromosomes showed higher
  gene expression levels than monosomic chromosomes, a finding that has not previously
  been reported for hyperhaploid tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest that
  disomy for some chromosomes, notably 5 and 20, as well as distorted gene expression
  achieved through massive loss of other chromosomes are essential features of ILMS.
