abstract: The Affymetrix cytogenetic 2.7M whole-genome microarray Cyto2.7M detects
  genomic aberrations. The Cyto2.7M array has increased coverage in regions with cancer-related
  genes, 4-fold reduced processing time, and 5-fold reduced input requirements 100
  ng compared to the commonly used Affymetrix SNP6.0 genome-wide microarray SNP6.0
  . We set out to compare the performance of these microarrays on cancer samples containing
  complex genomic changes. We analyzed genomic DNA from 8 lymphoma samples and 1 blood
  sample using both SNP6.0 and Cyto2.7M microarrays. We compared the arrays with respect
  to 4 parameters, including detection of copy number variations CNV , CNV boundaries,
  the actual copy number CN assigned to the aberrations, and loss of heterozygosity.
  The CN state of selected regions was validated by quantitative PCR. Very high consistency
  between arrays on all parameters tested was observed, hence only 30 of 224 aberrations
  disagreed on the CN state, corresponding to a total of 12 Mb or 0.06 of the analyzed
  base pairs. Thus, the SNP6.0 and Cyto2.7M arrays are equally well suited to detect
  genomic aberrations in complex samples such as cancer samples. With reduced processing
  time and lower input requirements, the Cyto2.7M array enables genomic analysis of
  samples where only limited DNA is available.
