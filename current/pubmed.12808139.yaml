abstract: According to the present view, metastasis marks the end in a sequence of
  genomic changes underlying the progression of an epithelial cell to a lethal cancer.
  Here, we aimed to find out at what stage of tumor development transformed cells
  leave the primary tumor and whether a defined genotype corresponds to metastatic
  disease. To this end, we isolated single disseminated cancer cells from bone marrow
  of breast cancer patients and performed single-cell comparative genomic hybridization.
  We analyzed disseminated tumor cells from patients after curative resection of the
  primary tumor stage M0 , as presumptive progenitors of manifest metastasis, and
  from patients with manifest metastasis stage M1 . Their genomic data were compared
  with those from microdissected areas of matched primary tumors. Disseminated cells
  from M0-stage patients displayed significantly fewer chromosomal aberrations than
  primary tumors or cells from M1-stage patients P amp lt 0.008 and P amp lt 0.0001,
  respectively , and their aberrations appeared to be randomly generated. In contrast,
  primary tumors and M1 cells harbored different and characteristic chromosomal imbalances.
  Moreover, applying machine-learning methods for the classification of the genotypes,
  we could correctly identify the presence or absence of metastatic disease in a patient
  on the basis of a single-cell genome. We suggest that in breast cancer, tumor cells
  may disseminate in a far less progressed genomic state than previously thought,
  and that they acquire genomic aberrations typical of metastatic cells thereafter.
  Thus, our data challenge the widely held view that the precursors of metastasis
  are derived from the most advanced clone within the primary tumor.
