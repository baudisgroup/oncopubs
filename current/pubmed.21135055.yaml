abstract: Breast cancer cells deficient for BRCA1 are hypersensitive to agents inducing
  DNA double-strand breaks DSB , such as bifunctional alkylators and platinum agents.
  Earlier, we had developed a comparative genomic hybridisation CGH classifier based
  on BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. We hypothesised that this BRCA1-like CGH classifier
  could also detect loss of function of BRCA1 due to other causes besides mutations
  and, consequently, might predict sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents.
