abstract: Diffuse astrocytomas are highly variable tumors and show complex biologic
  behavior that is based on multi-step oncogenesis. We report cytogenetic and molecular
  cytogenetic investigations in 23 cases of diffuse astrocytomas. The results of conventional
  karyotyping, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , comparative genomic
  hybridization, multicolor FISH, and spectral karyotyping are reported. Various numerical
  and structural chromosomal aberrations were identified. Clustering of structural
  alterations in the short arm of chromosome 2 2p and the long arm of chromosome 7
  7q were detected. Using spectral karyotyping, additional chromosome rearrangements
  not detectable by conventional methods were found. Some of these anomalies have
  not been previously described in diffuse astrocytomas. An independent validation
  of these discrepant findings is required.
