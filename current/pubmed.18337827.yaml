abstract: Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphomas SPTLs represent a rare,
  difficult-to-diagnose, and poorly characterized subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas
  CTCLs affecting younger people more than the other CTCL forms. We performed a thorough
  clinical, immunohistological, and molecular analysis of nine Finnish SPTL patients.
  Specifically, we performed single-cell comparative genomic hybridization CGH from
  laser microdissected, morphologically malignant SPTL cells, as well as loss of heterozygosity
  LOH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analysis for the NAV3 neuron navigator
  3 gene. CGH revealed large numbers of DNA copy number changes, the most common of
  which were losses of chromosomes 1pter, 2pter, 10qter, 11qter, 12qter, 16, 19, 20,
  and 22 and gains of chromosomes 2q and 4q. Some of the DNA copy number aberrations
  in SPTL, such as loss of 10q, 17p, and chromosome 19, overlap with those characteristic
  of common forms of CTCL mycosis fungoides MF and Sezary syndrome SS , whereas 5q
  and 13q gains characterize SPTL. Allelic NAV3 aberrations LOH or deletion by FISH
  , previously found in MF and SS, were identified in 44 of the SPTL samples. This
  study demonstrates that SPTL is also moleculocytogenetically a uniform entity of
  CTCL and supports the current World Health Organization-European Organization for
  Research and Treatment of Cancer WHO-EORTC classification defining SPTL as a subgroup
  of its own.
