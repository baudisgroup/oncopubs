abstract: 'ABSTRACT Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH has yet to be fully
  leveraged in a prognostic setting in chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . Genomic
  imbalance was assessed in 288 CLL specimens using a targeted array. Based on 20
  aberrations in a hierarchical manner, all 228 treatment-naive specimens were classified
  into a group with poor outcome 20.6 exhibiting at least one aberration that univariately
  associated with adverse outcome gain: 2p, 3q, 8q, 17q, loss: 7q, 8p, 11q, 17p, 18p
  , good outcome 32.5 showing 13q14 loss without any of the other ten aberrations
  gain: 1p, 7p, 12, 18p, 18q, 19, loss: 4p, 5p, 6q, 7p , or intermediate outcome remainder
  . The three groups significantly separated with respect to time to first treatment
  and overall survival P amp lt 0.001 and validation of the stratification scheme
  was performed in two independent datasets. Gain of 3q and 8q, and 17p loss were
  determined to be independent unfavorable prognostic biomarkers. TP53, NOTCH1, and
  SF3B1 mutations correlated with the presence of one poor outcome aCGH marker, at
  a considerably higher frequency than when only considering poor risk aberrations
  routinely detected by FISH. These data support genomic imbalance evaluation in CLL
  by aCGH to assist in risk stratification.'
