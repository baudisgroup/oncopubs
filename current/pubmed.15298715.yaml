abstract: Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone neoplasm of children and young adults.
  It is characterized by extremely complex karyotypes and high frequency of chromosomal
  amplifications. Currently, only the histological response degree of necrosis to
  therapy represent gold standard for predicting the outcome in a patient with non-metastatic
  osteosarcoma at the time of definitive surgery. Patients with lower degree of necrosis
  have a higher risk of relapse and poor outcome even after chemotherapy and complete
  resection of the primary tumor. Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying
  molecular genetic events leading to tumor initiation and progression could result
  in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
