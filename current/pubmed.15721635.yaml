abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC occurs with a high incidence in Southeast Asia
  and to a lesser extent in the Mediterranean area, especially in Tunisia, Algeria,
  and Morocco. Cellular gene alterations combined with latent Epstein-Barr virus infection
  are thought to be essential for NPC oncogenesis. To date, chromosome analysis with
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH has been reported exclusively for NPCs from
  Southeast Asia. Although NPCs from the Mediterranean area have several distinct
  clinical and epidemiological features, CGH investigations have been lacking. Chromosome
  analysis was therefore undertaken on a series of NPC xenografts and biopsies derived
  from patients of Mediterranean origin. Four xenografts were investigated with a
  combination of conventional CGH, array-based CGH, and comparative expressed sequence
  hybridization. In addition, 23 fresh NPC biopsies were analyzed with conventional
  CGH. Data obtained from xenografts and fresh biopsies were consistent, except that
  amplification of genes at 18p was observed only in xenografts derived from metastatic
  tissues. Frequent gains associated with gene overexpression were detected at 1q25
  approximately qter 64 and 12p13 50 . Losses were noticed mainly at 11q14 approximately
  q23 50 , 13q12 approximately q31 50 , 14q24 approximately q31 43 , and 3p13 approximately
  p23 43 . Comparison with previous reports suggests that Mediterranean NPCs have
  higher frequencies of gains at 1q and losses at 13q than their Asian counterparts.
