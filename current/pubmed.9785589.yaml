abstract: We investigated chromosomal aberrations in meningiomas using newly developed
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH technique and compared the results with the
  proliferating potential of the tumors. This technique permits the entire genome
  to be surveyed in one session of experiments. Our results revealed chromosomal aberrations
  in 5 out of 10 50 of the tumor samples studied. Losses of the distal parts of chromosome
  1p 5 out of 10 and 22q 3 out of 10 were the two most frequent chromosomal aberrations.
  Losses and or gains in other regions were only sporadic. The MIB-1 staining indices
  MIB-SI, were 1.9 - 0.9 mean - SD in benign n 8 , 4.5 in atypical n 1 , and 11.7
  in anaplastic n 1 meningiomas. The comparison of MIB-SI between the tumors with
  2.3 - 0.6 and without 1.6 - 0.3 chromosomal aberrations demonstrated a trend towards
  an increased MIB-SI in meningiomas with chromosomal aberrations p amp lt 0.07 by
  unpaired Students t-test. This study suggests that alterations in chromosomes 1p
  and 22q could be a primary focus of further detailed assessment of tumorigenesis
  and in understanding the biological behavior of meningiomas.
