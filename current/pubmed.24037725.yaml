abstract: Follicular lymphoma (FL), the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
  in the western world, is characterized by the t(14;18) translocation, which is present
  in up to 90% of cases. We studied 277 lymphoma samples (198 FL and 79 transformed
  FL [tFL]) using a single-nucleotide polymorphism array to identify the secondary
  chromosomal abnormalities that drive the development of FL and its transformation
  to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Common recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in
  FL included gains of 2, 5, 7, 6p, 8, 12, 17q, 18, 21, and X and losses on 6q and
  17p. We also observed many frequent small abnormalities, including losses of 1p36.33-p36.31,
  6q23.3-q24.1, and 10q23.1-q25.1 and gains of 2p16.1-p15, 8q24.13-q24.3, and 12q12-q13.13,
  and identified candidate genes that may be driving this selection. Recurrent abnormalities
  more frequent in tFL samples included gains of 3q27.3-q28 and chromosome 11 and
  losses of 9p21.3 and 15q. Four abnormalities, gain of X or Xp and losses of 6q23.2-24.1
  or 6q13-15, predicted overall survival. Abnormalities associated with transformation
  of the disease likely impair immune surveillance, activate the nuclear factor-ÎºB
  pathway, and deregulate p53 and B-cell transcription factors.

notes: Array-based copy number analysis using the high-resolution GeneChip Human Mapping
  250K Nsp SNP Array (Affymetrix) on 225 FL tumor samples and 84 tFL tumors to identify
  abnormalities that contribute to FL and influence survival.Inclusion of 198 FL and
