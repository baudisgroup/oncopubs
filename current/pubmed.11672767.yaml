abstract: 'Cytogenetic analysis is useful in the diagnosis and to assess prognosis
  of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-CLL . However, successful cytogenetics
  by standard techniques has been hindered by the low in vitro mitotic activity of
  the malignant B-cell population. Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH has become
  a useful tool, but it does not provide an overall view of the aberrations. To overcome
  this hurdle, two DNA-based techniques have been tested in the present study: comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH and amplotyping by arbitrarily primed PCR AP-PCR . Comparative
  genomic hybridization resolution depends upon the 400-bands of the human standard
  karyotype. AP-PCR allows detection of allelic losses and gains in tumor cells by
  PCR fingerprinting, thus its resolution is at the molecular level. Both techniques
  were performed in 23 patients with stage A B-CLL at diagnosis. The results were
  compared with FISH. The sensitivity of AP-PCR was greater than CGH 62 vs. 43 . The
  use of CGH combined with AP-PCR allowed to detect genetic abnormalities in 79 15
  19 of patients in whom G-banding was not informative, providing a global view of
  the aberrations in a sole experiment. This study shows that combining these two
  methods with FISH, makes possible a more precise genetic characterization of patients
  with B-CLL.'
