abstract: We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH and conventional cytogenetics
  CC to define chromosomal changes and to evaluate the usefulness of CGH in 65 patients
  having childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . Subsequently, fluorescence in
  situ hybridization FISH was used to evaluate the CGH and cytogenetic results. Comparative
  genomic hybridization revealed DNA copy number changes in 49 75 patients including
  7 patients with unsuccessful cytogenetics and 2 patients with normal karyotype .
  A total of 85 losses and 195 gains were detected. The most commonly gained chromosomes
  were 21 35 , X 31 , 18 27 , 10 26 , 6 25 , 17 25 , 4 23 , and 14 22 . Losses were
  most frequently observed on chromosomes 9p 18 and 12p 11 . Other losses were detected
  on chromosomes 13q 9 , 6q 9 , 7p 8 , and chromosome X 6 . Conventional cytogenetics
  revealed chromosomal changes in 53 82 patients. The employment of CGH and FISH together
  with CC analysis revealed chromosomal changes in 62 95 of the childhood ALL patients
  investigated. The CGH completed CC results in 36 patients in 9 patients, the changes
  escaped detection without using CGH. The results of our study were compared to 6
  other CGH studies previously reported. Our observations underline the benefits of
  supplementing routine cytogenetic investigation in childhood ALL by FISH and CGH,
  because small unbalanced changes may escape detection when conventional cytogenetics
  is the only diagnostic method used.
