abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC is a frequently fatal heterogeneous
  disease. Beyond the role of human papilloma virus HPV , no validated molecular characterization
  of the disease has been established. Using an integrated genomic analysis and validation
  methodology we confirm four molecular classes of HNSCC basal, mesenchymal, atypical,
  and classical consistent with signatures established for squamous carcinoma of the
  lung, including deregulation of the KEAP1 NFE2L2 oxidative stress pathway, differential
  utilization of the lineage markers SOX2 and TP63, and preference for the oncogenes
  PIK3CA and EGFR. For potential clinical use the signatures are complimentary to
  classification by HPV infection status as well as the putative high risk marker
  CCND1 copy number gain. A molecular etiology for the subtypes is suggested by statistically
  significant chromosomal gains and losses and differential cell of origin expression
  patterns. Model systems representative of each of the four subtypes are also presented.
