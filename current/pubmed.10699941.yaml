abstract: To characterize the type of genetic alterations in gastrointestinal stromal
  tumors GISTs , we performed a comprehensive allelotype study of 14 GISTs 2 benign,
  7 borderline and 5 malignant by polymerase-chain-reaction and loss-of-heterozygosity
  PCR-LOH analysis using 102 microsatellite markers, and compared the results with
  comparative-genomic-hybridization CGH analysis. Among the 38 evaluated chromosomal
  arms, 16 42.1 showed LOH in at least one patient. Most frequent LOH was observed
  at chromosome 14p and 14q 9 14, 64 and this was demonstrated in all types of GISTs
  50 in benign, 71 in borderline and 80 in malignant . Additional chromosomal deletions
  were found in several chromosomal arms. Among them, deletions on chromosomal arms
  of 22q 3 14, 21.4 , 9p 2 14, 14.3 and 9q 2 14, 14.3 were the most frequent, and
  were detected only in malignant GISTs both by PCR-LOH and by CGH analysis. Additionally,
  2 malignant GISTs with LOH on 9p showed homozygous deletions in the restricted area
  of 9p by multiplex PCR-LOH analysis. Thus, several putative chromosomal changes
  were preferentially present in malignant GISTs but rare in benign and borderline
  GISTs. These findings suggest that accumulated chromosomal changes may contribute
  to the progression and or malignant transformation of GISTs.
