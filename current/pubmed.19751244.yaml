abstract: Solitary fibrous tumors SFT are rare neoplasms of mesenchymal origin involving
  soft tissues, mainly serosal sites the spinal cord location is uncommon. We report
  a case of SFT occurring in the thoracic spinal cord, discussing histological, ultrastructural
  and molecular aspects. A 75-year-old woman with an MRI suggesting a dorsal intracanalar
  lesion was admitted to our institution. T5-T7 laminectomies were performed and an
  intramedullary tumor was discovered. The tumor arose within the spinal cord and
  was completely removed. Tumor samples were processed for histological, ultrastructural
  and molecular analysis comparative genomic hybridization CGH , methylation status
  of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase MGMT , p16, deleted in colorectal cancer
  DCC and death-associated protein kinase 1 DAPK1 . The histological examination demonstrated
  a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with a collagen-matrix background. Immunohistochemical
  staining was positive for vimentin and CD34 and negative for S-100 and epithelial
  membrane antigen. A histological diagnosis of SFT was made. The ultrastructural
  examination showed undifferentiated cells within a collagenous matrix and sparse
  extravascular basement membrane. CGH analysis revealed deletion of 9p21 and losses
  on 2q, 3p, 16q and 19q and gains on 7q furthermore, no aberrant methylation pattern
  was found in the promoter region of MGMT, p16, DCC and DAPK1 genes. On the second-year
  follow-up, the patient was neurologically intact. The occurrence of SFT within the
  spinal cord parenchyma and its histological characteristics demonstrate that SFTs
  are not restricted to serosal surfaces. The course of spinal cord SFT is unknown
  and long-term follow-up is necessary. The histological, ultrastructural and molecular
  findings are important for the diagnosis and the authors provide a literature review
  of these aspects.
