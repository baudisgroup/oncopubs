abstract: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that chromosomal
  imbalances in central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumours PNETs reflect
  site and histology. We used comparative genomic hybridization to study 37 cases
  of PNET, of which four were cerebral and 31 were medulloblastomas classified histologically
  as classic n 17 or nodular desmoplastic n 14 . Tumour immunophenotype was characterized
  with antibodies to neuroglial, mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Chromosomal imbalances
  were detected in 28 medulloblastomas 90 , and significant associations between tumour
  variants and genetic abnormalities were demonstrated. Aberrations suggesting isochromosome
  17q were present in eight 26 medulloblastomas, of which seven were classic variants.
  None of these cases, or a further six with gain of 17q, showed immunoreactivity
  for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Loss on 9q was found in six cases 19 , five
  of them nodular desmoplastic. Loss of 22 occurred in four 13 , all classic medulloblastomas
  in young patients with a poor outcome and immunoreactivity for more than one epithelial
  or mesenchymal marker. Different patterns of imbalance were found in the cerebral
  PNETs. There were no abnormalities of chromosome 17, but all three cases with imbalance
  showed losses of 3p12.3-p14.
