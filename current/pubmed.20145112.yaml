abstract: Analysis of chromosomal aberrations is used to determine the prognosis of
  neuroblastomas NBs and to aid treatment decisions. MYCN amplification MNA alone
  is an incomplete poor prognostic factor, and chromosome 11q status has recently
  been included in risk classification. We analyzed 165 NB tumors using high-density
  SNP microarrays and specifically compared the high-risk groups defined by MNA n
  37 and 11q-deletion n 21 . Median patient age at diagnosis was 21 months for MNA
  tumors and 42 months for 11q-deletion tumors, and median survival time after diagnosis
  was 16 months for MNA and 40 months for 11q deletion. Overall survival at 8 years
  was approximately 35 in both groups. MNA and 11q deletion were almost mutually exclusive
  only one case harbored both aberrations. The numbers of segmental aberrations differed
  significantly the MNA group had a median of four aberrations, whereas the 11q-deletion
  group had 12. The high frequency of chromosomal breaks in the 11q-deletion group
  is suggestive of a chromosomal instability phenotype gene located in 11q one such
  gene, H2AFX, is located in 11q23.3 within the 11q-deletion region . Furthermore,
  in the groups with segmental aberrations without MNA or 11q deletion, the tumors
  with 17q gain have worse prognosis than those with segmental aberrations without
  17q gain, which have a favorable outcome. This study has implications for therapy
  in different risk groups and stresses that genome-wide microarray analyses should
  be included in clinical management to fully evaluate risk, aid diagnosis, and guide
  treatment.
