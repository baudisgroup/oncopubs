abstract: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas
  primarily involving the skin. The most common types are mycosis fungoides (MF) and
  Sezary Syndrome (SS). We report a novel long-term fast-growing SS line termed BKP1
  that was characterized by flow cytometry (FC), conventional and molecular cytogenetic
  [FISH/multi-FISH together with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)].
  FC immunophenotype of the BKP1 is CD2+CD5+CD3+CD4+CD8-CD7-CD25-CD26-CD30-CD158k+.
  The TCRÎ³ characterization of BKP1 by PCR identified a clonal rearrangement. The
  conventional cytogenetic and Multi-FISH analysis showed complex chromosomal rearrangements.
  aCGH analysis highlighted the loss of genes involved in cell cycle control, in immune
  response (HLA, complement complex) and DNA damage repair mechanisms. The BKP1 is
  another lymphoma cell line thoroughly characterized that can be a valuable tool
  for both basic and applied research such as identification of deregulated genes
  and/or pathways and screening for new antilymphoma drugs.  Â© 2014 John Wiley &
