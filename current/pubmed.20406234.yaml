abstract: 'Glioblastomas are morphologically and genetically heterogeneous, but little
  is known about the regional patterns of genomic imbalance within glioblastomas.
  We recently established a reliable whole genome amplification WGA method to randomly
  amplify DNA from paraffin-embedded histological sections with minimum amplification
  bias Huang et al J Mol Diagn 11: 109-116, 2009 . In this study, chromosomal imbalance
  was assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization CGH Agilent 105K, Agilent
  Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA , using WGA-DNA from two to five separate tumor
  areas of 14 primary glioblastomas total, 41 tumor areas . Chromosomal imbalances
  significantly differed among glioblastomas the only alterations that were observed
  in amp gt or 6 cases were loss of chromosome 10q, gain at 7p and loss of 10p. Genetic
  alterations common to all areas analyzed within a single tumor included gains at
  1q32.1 PIK3C2B, MDM4 , 4q11-q12 KIT, PDGFRA , 7p12.1-11.2 EGFR , 12q13.3-12q14.1
  GLI1, CDK4 and 12q15 MDM2 , and loss at 9p21.1-24.3 p16 INK4a p14 ARF , 10p15.3-q26.3
  PTEN, etc. and 13q12.11-q34 SPRY2, RB1 . These are likely to be causative in the
  pathogenesis of glioblastomas driver mutations . In addition, there were numerous
  tumor area-specific genomic imbalances, which may be either nonfunctional passenger
  mutations or functional, but constitute secondary events reflecting progressive
  genomic instability, a hallmark of glioblastomas.'
