abstract: Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney CCSK represents a significant diagnostic
  and clinical challenge. In search of diagnostically useful or biologically significant
  genetic abnormalities, we screened 30 CCSKs from the National Wilms Tumor Study
  Group. Genetic gains and losses were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization
  loss of heterozygosity at 11p15 was studied using microsatellite analysis. Loss
  of imprinting LOI was studied using allele-specific expression or methylation analysis
  at the ApaI polymorphic site for IGF2, AluI and RsaI sites for H19, and Cfo I site
  for SNRPN. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed quantitative abnormalities
  in only 4 of 30 CCSKs. Two showed gain of 1q, one also showed loss of 10q, and the
  other also showed loss of terminal 4p. The other two cases demonstrated chromosome
  19 loss and chromosome 19p gain, respectively. All 22 cases informative for 11p15
  showed retention of both alleles. Of 14 CCSKs informative for IGF2, six showed biallelic
  expression all three CCSKs informative for H19 exhibited monoallelic expression.
  The normal imprint pattern was present in all six CCSKs analyzed for SNRPN methylation.
  These data demonstrate an absence of consistent genetic gains or losses in CCSKs
  using these methods. The high frequency of LOI for IGF2 in CCSKs 43 is comparable
  to that reported in Wilms tumors. The retention of imprinting at the SNRPN and H19
  loci confirm that LOI is not a ubiquitous epigenetic change. This suggests that
  IGF2, a potent growth factor, may play a role in the development or progression
  of CCSK.
