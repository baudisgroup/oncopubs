abstract: Information on structural chromosomal changes in brain metastases BM of
  colorectal carcinoma CRC is very limited. Therapeutic and diagnostic strategies
  to reduce the risk of BM have potential impact on cancer mortality. By using comparative
  genomic hybridization, the primary CRC of 11 patients and their corresponding 13
  BM were analyzed. BM showed significantly more mean chromosomal aberrations than
  the primary CRC 13.6 -2.1 vs. 7.9 -1.9, P 0.03 , significantly more chromosomal
  gains 7.2 -0.9 vs. 3.5 -0.9, P 0.01 , and tended to have also more losses 6.1 -1.4
  vs. 4.0 -1.1, P 0.29 . Changes that occurred significantly more often in BM than
  in primary CRC were gains of 8q, 12p, 12q, and 20p, as well as losses of 5q. BM
  of CRC show a significantly higher chromosomal instability in comparison to primary
  tumors. The prevalently altered genomic regions in the metastases of this study
  are likely to harbor genes that play an important role in the genesis of brain-specific
  metastasis.
