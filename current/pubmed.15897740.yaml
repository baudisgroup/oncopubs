abstract: Columnar cell lesions CCLs of the breast are a spectrum of lesions that
  have posed difficulties to pathologists for many years, prompting discussion concerning
  their biologic and clinical significance. We present a study of CCL in context with
  hyperplasia of usual type HUT and the more advanced lesions ductal carcinoma in
  situ DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma. A total of 81 lesions from 18 patients
  were subjected to a comprehensive morphologic review based upon a modified version
  of Schnitts classification system for CCL, immunophenotypic analysis estrogen receptor
  ER , progesterone receptor PgR , Her2 neu, cytokeratin 5 6 CK5 6 , cytokeratin 14
  CK14 , E-cadherin, p53 and for the first time, a whole genome molecular analysis
  by comparative genomic hybridization. Multiple CCLs from 3 patients were studied
  in particular detail, with topographic information and or showing a morphologic
  spectrum of CCL within individual terminal duct lobular units. CCLs were ER and
  PgR positive, CK5 6 and CK14 negative, exhibit low numbers of genetic alterations
  and recurrent 16q loss, features that are similar to those of low grade in situ
  and invasive carcinoma. The molecular genetic profiles closely reflect the degree
  of proliferation and atypia in CCL, indicating some of these lesions represent both
  a morphologic and molecular continuum. In addition, overlapping chromosomal alterations
  between CCL and more advanced lesions within individual terminal duct lobular units
  suggest a commonality in molecular evolution. These data further support the hypothesis
  that CCLs are a nonobligate, intermediary step in the development of some forms
  of low grade in situ and invasive carcinoma.
