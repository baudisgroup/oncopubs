abstract: High-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism SNP -array technologies allow
  to investigate copy number variants CNVs in genome-wide scans and specific calling
  algorithms have been developed to determine CNV location and copy number. We report
  the results of a reliability analysis comparing data from 96 pairs of samples processed
  with CNVpartition, PennCNV, and QuantiSNP for Infinium Illumina Human 1Million probe
  chip data. We also performed a validity assessment with multiplex ligation-dependent
  probe amplification MLPA as a reference standard. The number of CNVs per individual
  varied according to the calling algorithm. Higher numbers of CNVs were detected
  in saliva than in blood DNA samples regardless of the algorithm used. All algorithms
  presented low agreement with mean Kappa Index KI amp lt 66. PennCNV was the most
  reliable algorithm KI w 98.96 when assessing the number of copies. The agreement
  observed in detecting CNV was higher in blood than in saliva samples. When comparing
  to MLPA, all algorithms identified poorly known copy aberrations sensitivity 0.19-0.28
  . In contrast, specificity was very high 0.97-0.99 . Once a CNV was detected, the
  number of copies was truly assessed sensitivity amp gt 0.62 . Our results indicate
  that the current calling algorithms should be improved for high performance CNV
  analysis in genome-wide scans. Further refinement is required to assess CNVs as
  risk factors in complex diseases.
