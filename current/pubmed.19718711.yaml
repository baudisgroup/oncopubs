abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC is a distinct type of head and neck cancer
  commonly occurring in southern China. To decipher the molecular basis of this cancer,
  we performed high-resolution array CGH analysis on eight tumour lines and 10 primary
  tumours to identify the genes involved in NPC tumorigenesis. In this study, multiple
  regions of gain were consistently found at 1q21-q24, 7q11-12, 7q21-22., 11q13, 12p13,
  12q13, 19p13 and 19q13. Importantly, a 2.1 Mb region at 12p13.31 was highly amplified
  in a NPC xenograft, xeno-2117. By FISH mapping, we have further delineated the amplicon
  to a 1.24 region flanked by RP11-319E16 and RP11-433J6. Copy number gains of this
  amplicon were confirmed in 21 41 51 primary tumours, while three cases 7.3 showed
  high copy number amplification. Among the 13 genes within this amplicon, three candidate
  genes, lymphotoxin beta receptor LTbetaR , tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily
  memeber 1A TNFRSF1R and FLJ10665, were specifically over-expressed in the NPC xenograft
  with 12p13.3 amplification. However, only LTbetaR was frequently over-expressed
  in primary tumours. LTbetaR is a member of the TNF family of receptors, which can
  modulate NF-kappaB signalling pathways. Over-expression of LTbetaR in nasopharyngeal
  epithelial cells resulted in an increase of NF-kappaB activity and cell proliferation.
  In vivo study showed that suppression of LTbetaR by siRNA led to growth inhibition
  in the NPC tumour with 12p13.3 amplification. These findings implied that LTbetaR
  is a potential NPC-associated oncogene within the 12p13.3 amplicon and that its
  alteration is important in NPC tumorigenesis.
