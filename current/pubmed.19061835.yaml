abstract: von Hippel-Lindau VHL tumor suppressor loss results in hypoxia-inducible
  factor alpha HIF-alpha stabilization and occurs in 70 of sporadic clear cell renal
  carcinomas ccRCCs . To determine whether opposing influences of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha
  on c-Myc activity regulate human ccRCC progression, we analyzed VHL genotype and
  HIF-alpha expression in 160 primary tumors, which segregated into three groups with
  distinct molecular characteristics. Interestingly, ccRCCs with intact VHL, as well
  as pVHL-deficient HIF-1alpha HIF-2alpha-expressing ccRCCs, exhibited enhanced Akt
  mTOR and ERK MAPK signaling. In contrast, pVHL-deficient ccRCCs expressing only
  HIF-2alpha displayed elevated c-Myc activity, resulting in enhanced proliferation
  and resistance to replication stress. These reproducible distinctions in ccRCC behavior
  delineate HIF-alpha effects on c-Myc in vivo and suggest molecular criteria for
  selecting targeted therapies.
