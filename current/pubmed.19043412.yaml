abstract: 'Cancer results from somatic alterations in key genes, including point mutations,
  copy-number alterations and structural rearrangements. A powerful way to discover
  cancer-causing genes is to identify genomic regions that show recurrent copy-number
  alterations gains and losses in tumor genomes. Recent advances in sequencing technologies
  suggest that massively parallel sequencing may provide a feasible alternative to
  DNA microarrays for detecting copy-number alterations. Here we present: i a statistical
  analysis of the power to detect copy-number alterations of a given size ii SegSeq,
  an algorithm to segment equal copy numbers from massively parallel sequence data
  and iii analysis of experimental data from three matched pairs of tumor and normal
  cell lines. We show that a collection of approximately 14 million aligned sequence
  reads from human cell lines has comparable power to detect events as the current
  generation of DNA microarrays and has over twofold better precision for localizing
  breakpoints typically, to within approximately 1 kilobase .'
