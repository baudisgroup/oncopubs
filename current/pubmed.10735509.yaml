abstract: Very little is known about genetic abnormalities involved in the development
  of pilocytic astrocytoma, the most frequently occurring brain tumour of childhood.
  We have analysed 48 pilocytic astrocytoma specimens using comparative genomic hybridization.
  Only five of 41 tumours from children showed abnormalities detectable by comparative
  genomic hybridization, and in each case this represented gain of a single chromosome.
  Interestingly, two of seven tumours from adults showed abnormalities, which were
  multiple and relatively complex. Six of the seven tumours showing abnormalities
  were from female patients two adults and four children . The most frequently detectable
  abnormality was gain of 9q34.1-qter, which was present in three cases two adult
  and one paediatric .
