abstract: The goal of this study was CGH array profiling of breast cancer from Malian
  women in order to define differences with those from USA. CGH array was performed
  in 28 samples, 17 with a triple negative phenotype. The profiles were compared to
  those of 106 tumors from USA. 6 chromosomal regions 6p21, 9q34, 11q13, 12q24, 17q25
  and 22q12.1-22q13.1 were identified with a significant higher rate of copy number
  alterations. These regions contain several genes of interest including BCR. FISH
  and IHC confirmed that BCR was amplified and overexpressed particularly in triple
  negative tumors. Finally, 5 regions presented a high level of amplification in two
  or more samples, including 2 regions located between 9p22.3-9p23 and 9p23-9p24.1.
  This study confirms that breast cancers from African women present biological differences
  with those from USA. Larger studies are needed to go further in the identification
  of therapeutic targets that would be specific to African women.
