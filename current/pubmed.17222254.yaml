abstract: To report the demographic, clinical and molecular profile of a series of
  intraspinal nerve sheath myxomas. Nerve sheath myxomas are diagnostically challenging,
  mainly cutaneous spindle cell neoplasms exhibiting Schwann cell differentiation.
  They are frequently mistaken for neurothekeomas and their genetic features are essentially
  unknown.
