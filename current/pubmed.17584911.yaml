abstract: To identify cytogenetic features of large cell transformation in mycosis
  fungoides T-MF , we selected in 11 patients, 16 samples either from skin tumors
  13 , lymph node 1 , or peripheral blood cells 2 collected at the time of the transformation.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH , G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridisation
  FISH , multicolour FISH mFISH , and DNA content analysis were used. Fifteen samples
  displayed unbalanced CGH profiles, with gains more frequently observed than losses.
  Recurrent chromosomal alterations were observed for chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 9, 17,
  and 19. The most common imbalances were gain of chromosome regions 1p36, 7, 9q34,
  17q24-qter, 19, and loss of 2q36-qter, 9p21, and 17p. In six samples 1p36-pter gain
  was associated with 9q34-qter gain and whole chromosome 19 gain. In five of these
  samples whole or partial gain of chromosome 17 was also observed. No specific pattern
  was seen with regard to the expression of the CD30 antigen by tumor cells. Cytogenetics
  and or DNA content analysis of skin tumor cells revealed an abnormal chromosome
  number in all tested cases n 7 with DNA ploidy ranging from hyperdiploid 2.78 to
  hypotetraploid 3.69 mean 3.14 -0.38 . Thus, T-MF displayed frequent chromosomal
  imbalances associated with hypotetraploidy.
