abstract: The clinical significance of partial chromosome 3 alteration in uveal melanoma
  is still not clear. Also, the reported frequencies vary considerably in the published
  literature from 0 to 48 . The aims of the following study were to identify the frequency,
  molecular pathology and potential clinical significance of partial chromosome 3
  alteration in uveal melanoma. We studied 47 uveal melanomas with an average follow-up
  of 36 months. Of these, 14 had confirmed metastasis. Allelic imbalance loss of heterozygosity
  was studied using microsatellite markers on chromosome 3 enriched in markers located
  in the previously reported smallest regions of deletion overlap. Chromosomal alterations
  were assessed by conventional cytogenetics or comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in a subset of patients. Utilizing genotyping, partial chromosome 3 alteration
  was detected in 14 47 tumors 30 . In the 23 tumors with available cytogenetic CGH,
  partial chromosome 3 alteration was detected in 8 23 38 and was caused by both gains
  4 8 and losses 4 8 of chromosome 3 with high frequency of complex chromosome 3 aberrations
  detected by cytogenetics. Out of the 14 tumors with confirmed metastasis, only 1
  showed partial chromosome 3 alteration and the remaining showed monosomy 3. By limiting
  the aggressive disease marker to monosomy 3, genotyping showed 93 sensitivity and
  67 specificity for detection of aggressive uveal melanoma. In conclusion, partial
  chromosome 3 alterations are common in uveal melanoma and mostly caused by complex
  cytogenetic changes leading to partial gains and or partial losses of chromosome
  3. Partial chromosome 3 alteration is not likely to be associated with highly aggressive
  uveal melanoma that metastasizes within the first 3 years after treatment. Microsatellite-based
  genotyping of chromosome 3 is highly sensitive for detection of aggressive uveal
  melanoma.
