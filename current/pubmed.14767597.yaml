abstract: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours AT RT are highly malignant embryonal
  tumours of the brain composed of rhabdoid cells. Inactivating mutations of the hSNF5
  INI-1 gene located in the chromosomal region 22q11.2 are regarded as a crucial step
  in their molecular pathogenesis. Apart from monosomy or deletions of chromosome
  22 not much data exists on additional chromosomal aberrations.
