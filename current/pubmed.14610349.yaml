abstract: 35 oral squamous cell carcinomas examined previously by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH exhibited 5 up to 47 copy number alterations CNAs . 13 of those
  cases showed a loss of parts of the short arm of chromosome 9, band p21 being affected
  in all of these cases. A highly complex but strikingly consistent pattern of genomic
  imbalances with an average 31.5 CNAs per tumor was associated with this deletion,
  and gains clearly dominated over losses of genomic material. Comparable patterns,
  however, could also be found in tumors with a high number of CNAs 24 CNAs but without
  the deletion. Low numbers of imbalances were accompanied by low consistency of the
  CNA patterns. None of these latter cases showed the deletion 9p21. 66.7 of the dim
  9p21 -positive tumors were of class pT4 vs. 22 in dim 9p21 -negative cases , 77
  of stage III or IV vs. 47 in the group without the deletion , but only 8 of the
  dim 9p21 -positive tumors were classified as grade 3 vs. 41 in the negative group
  . Other clinicopathologic features like prevalence of relapse, or survival time
  could not be as clearly associated with the deletion. For instance, short relapse-free
  survival was clearly associated with a high number of CNAs, rather independent of
  presence or absence of dim 9p21 in the affected tumor. From these findings it is
  concluded that previously found associations of 9p21 deletion with clinical parameters
  can reasonably be estimated only in the context of the pattern and complexity of
  the genomic imbalances accompanying this chromosomal loss in the examined tumors.
