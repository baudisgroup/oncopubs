abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis was performed on both a pre-
  and post-chemotherapy hepatoblastoma from a 24-month-old female patient. The diagnostic
  sample obtained from a tru-cut biopsy was a mixed epithelial-mesenchymal tumor with
  both fetal and embryonal patterns present. In contrast, the post-chemotherapy tumor
  exhibited a prominent anaplastic large cell population focally reminiscent of pleomorphic
  hepatocellular carcinoma HCC . CGH analysis indicated that there were similarities
  as well as differences in the gains and losses of genetic material in each tumor.
  The diagnostic sample had gains of chromosome 1q, 2, 2 q31q33 , 7, 8q, 12 q15q22
  , 17q and 20 material, while the post-chemotherapy tumor had gains of 1q, 2, 7,
  8q, 10, 17q and 20 material. In addition, the pre- and post-chemotherapy samples
  may have incurred loss of chromosome 17p material. The main differences between
  the two samples involved localized gain of 2 q31q33 and 12 q15q22 in the pre-chemotherapy
  sample, and gain of chromosome 10 material in the post-chemotherapy tumor. The patient
  subsequently developed metastatic nodules in her lungs, the histology of which was
  identical in pattern to the diagnostic pattern, and appeared to have localized gain
  of 2 q31q33 and 12 q15q22 . These results are consistent with published results
  that gain of chromosome 8q and 20 are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
