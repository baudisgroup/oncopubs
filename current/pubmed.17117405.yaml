abstract: Although most gastric cancers occur in elderly patients, a substantial number
  of cases of this common disease occur in young patients. Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous
  disease at the genomic level and different patterns of DNA copy number alterations
  are associated with different clinical behaviour. The aim of the present study was
  to explore differences in DNA copy number alterations in relation to age of onset
  of gastric cancer. DNA isolated from 46 paraffin-embedded gastric cancer tissue
  samples from 17 patients less than 50 years of age median 43 21-49 years and 29
  patients greater than or equal to 70 years of age median 75 70-83 years was analysed
  by genome-wide microarray comparative genomic hybridization array CGH using an array
  of 5000 BAC clones. Patterns of DNA copy number aberrations were analysed by hierarchical
  cluster analysis of the mode-normalized and smoothed log 2 ratios of tumour to normal
  reference fluorescence signal intensities using TMEV software, after which cluster
  membership was correlated with age group. In addition, supervised analysis was performed
  using CGH Multi-array. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the array CGH data revealed
  three clusters with different genomic profiles that correlated significantly with
  age p 0.006 . Cluster 1 mainly contained young patients, while elderly patients
  were divided over clusters 2 and 3. Chromosome regions 11q23.3 and 19p13.3 contributed
  most to age-related differences in tumour profiles. Gastric cancers of young and
  old patients belong to groups with different genomic profiles, which likely reflect
  different pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.
