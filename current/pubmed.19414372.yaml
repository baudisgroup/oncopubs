abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNSTs develop in patients with
  underlying NF1, and usually arise as a result of malignant transformation of a pre-existing
  plexiform neurofibroma. The clonal cytogenetic abnormalities reported in primary
  MPNST include complex karyotypes with chromosome numbers in the triploid or tetraploid
  range with recurrent abnormalities of several chromosomes including losses or imbalances.
  As a prelude to cell biological, pharmacological, and functional studies to investigate
  pathways and gene s associated with multistep tumorigenesis, which includes progression,
  metastasis and resistance to therapy in MPNST, detailed molecular cytogenetic and
  genetic analyses of cell lines from primary, metastatic and recurrent MPNST with
  underlying NF1 disorder have been performed. The clonal cytogenetic abnormalities
  detected in the primary tumor cell line were similar to those observed in primary
  cultures of this tumor. Due to the complexity of the rearrangements seen by G-banded
  karyotype analysis, further characterization of the clonal abnormalities in these
  three cell lines was performed by molecular cytogenetic techniques, including CGH
  and SKY. CGH analysis detected recurrent deletions of 9p, 12q21-q32, complete losses
  of the X-chromosome, and gains of the chromosomal segment 17q25 in all three cell
  lines. SKY analysis detected extensive clonal abnormalities in these cell lines.
  The nature and the alterations of the cell cycle regulators, particularly those
  associated with G1-S checkpoints and known to be deregulated in MPNST, were studied.
  These cell cycle regulators included those associated with Rb1-cyclin D1 and the
  p53 pathways. The findings are consistent with the argument that an imbalance between
  the cyclin activators of CDKs and inhibitory proteins such as p16 result in uncontrollable
  proliferation in the cell lines, associated with progression of the disease. LOH
  and expression of the p53 gene in metastatic and recurrent cell lines was observed,
  as reported by others. The role of biallelic inactivation of p53 gene in MPNST with
  underlying NF1 mutations, however, needs further study. Overexpression of Rb1-protein
  observed in metastatic and recurrent cell lines is indicative of its role in the
  progression of the disease. One of the most important observations of this study
  is that Nm23-H1 expression is closely associated with advanced or metastatic disease.
  In summary, MPNST cell lines derived from a patient with metastatic and recurrent
  disease with NF1 disorder were characterized and a gene associated with metastatic
  potential which is amenable to therapeutic and chemo-preventative approaches was
  identified. These cell lines with extensive characterization of genetic abnormalities
  are likely to provide important reagents for biochemical, molecular and pharmacological
  studies related to MPNST.
