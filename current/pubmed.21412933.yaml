abstract: Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome BHDS , caused by germline mutations in the folliculin
  FLCN gene, predisposes individuals to develop fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts,
  spontaneous pneumothoraces, and kidney cancer. The FLCN mutation detection rate
  by bidirectional DNA sequencing in the National Cancer Institute BHDS cohort was
  88 . To determine if germline FLCN intragenic deletions duplications were responsible
  for BHDS in families lacking FLCN sequence alterations, 23 individuals from 15 unrelated
  families with clinically confirmed BHDS but no sequence variations were analyzed
  by real-time quantitative PCR RQ-PCR using primers for all 14 exons. Multiplex ligation-dependent
  probe amplification MLPA assay and array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH were utilized to confirm and fine map the rearrangements. Long-range PCR followed
  by DNA sequencing was used to define the breakpoints. We identified six unique intragenic
  deletions in nine patients from six different BHDS families including four involving
  exon 1, one that spanned exons 2-5, and one that encompassed exons 7-14 of FLCN.
  Four of the six deletion breakpoints were mapped, revealing deletions ranging from
  5688 to 9189 bp. In addition, one 1341 bp duplication, which included exons 10 and
  11, was identified and mapped. This report confirms that large intragenic FLCN deletions
  can cause BHDS and documents the first large intragenic FLCN duplication in a BHDS
  patient. Additionally, we identified a deletion amp quot hot spot amp quot in the
  5-noncoding-exon 1 region that contains the putative FLCN promoter based on a luciferase
  reporter assay. RQ-PCR, MLPA and aCGH may be used for clinical molecular diagnosis
  of BHDS in patients who are FLCN mutation-negative by DNA sequencing.
