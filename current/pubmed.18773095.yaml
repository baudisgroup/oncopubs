abstract: Chromosomal abnormalities, such as structural and numerical abnormalities,
  are a common occurrence in cancer. The close association of homologous chromosomes
  during interphase, a phenomenon termed somatic chromosome pairing, has been observed
  in cancerous cells, but the functional consequences of somatic pairing have not
  been established. Gene expression profiling studies revealed that somatic pairing
  of chromosome 19 is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in renal oncocytoma, a neoplasia
  of the adult kidney. Somatic pairing was associated with significant disruption
  of gene expression within the paired regions and resulted in the deregulation of
  the prolyl-hydroxylase EGLN2 corrected a key protein that regulates the oxygen-dependent
  degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF . Overexpression of EGLN2 corrected
  in renal oncocytoma increased ubiquitin-mediated destruction of HIF and concomitantly
  suppressed the expression of several HIF-target genes, including the pro-death BNIP3L
  gene. The transcriptional changes that are associated with somatic pairing of chromosome
  19 mimic the transcriptional changes that occur following DNA amplification. Therefore,
  in addition to numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, alterations in
  chromosomal spatial dynamics should be considered as genomic events that are associated
  with tumorigenesis. The identification of EGLN2 as a significantly deregulated gene
  that maps within the paired chromosome region directly implicates defects in the
  oxygen-sensing network to the biology of renal oncocytoma.
