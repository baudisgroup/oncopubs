abstract: An improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of brain metastases,
  one of the most common and devastating complications of advanced melanoma, may identify
  and prioritize rational therapeutic approaches for this disease. In particular,
  the identification of molecular differences between brain and extracranial metastases
  would support the need for the development of organ-specific therapeutic approaches.Hotspot
  mutations, copy number variations (CNV), global mRNA expression patterns, and quantitative
  analysis of protein expression and activation by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)
  analysis were evaluated in pairs of melanoma brain metastases and extracranial metastases
  from patients who had undergone surgical resection for both types of tumors.The
  status of 154 previously reported hotspot mutations, including driver mutations
  in BRAF and NRAS, were concordant in all evaluable patient-matched pairs of tumors.
  Overall patterns of CNV, mRNA expression, and protein expression were largely similar
  between the paired samples for individual patients. However, brain metastases demonstrated
  increased expression of several activation-specific protein markers in the PI3K/AKT
  pathway compared with the extracranial metastases.These results add to the understanding
  of the molecular characteristics of melanoma brain metastases and support the rationale
  for additional testing of the PI3K/AKT pathway as a therapeutic target in these
  highly aggressive tumors.
