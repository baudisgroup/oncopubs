abstract: The dic 7 9 p11 approximately 13 p11 approximately 13 is a recurrent chromosomal
  abnormality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL , mainly of B-lineage. Although
  more than 20 dic 7 9 -positive ALLs have been reported to date, the molecular genetic
  consequences of this aberration are unknown. We performed tiling resolution 32K
  genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH analysis of
  three cases with dic 7 9 in order to characterize the breakpoints on 7p and 9p.
  The analysis showed a clustering of breakpoints within 9p13.1 in all three cases
  and within 7p11.2 in two cases the array CGH revealed two different breakpoints
  - 7p12.1 and 7p14.1 - in the remaining case. Based on these findings the abnormality
  should hence be designated dic 7 9 p11.2 approximately 12.1 p13.1 . Locus-specific
  fluorescence in situhybridization analysis of one of the cases narrowed down the
  7p11.2 breakpoint to a amp lt 500-kb segment in this sub-band, a region containing
  three known genes. Unfortunately, lack of material precluded further molecular genetic
  studies, and it thus remains unknown whether the pathogenetically important outcome
  of the dic 7 9 is formation of a chimeric gene or loss of 7p and or 9p material.
