abstract: Myelodysplastic syndrome MDS , a clonal disorder originating from hematopoietic
  stem cell, is characterized by a progressive character often leading to transformation
  to acute myeloid leukemia. We used single nucleotide polymorphism arrays SNP-A to
  identify previously cryptic chromosomal abnormalities such as copy number alterations
  and uniparental disomies UPD in cytogenetically normal MDS. In the aberrant regions,
  we attempted to localize candidate genes with potential relevance to the disease.
  Using SNP-A, we analyzed peripheral blood granulocytes from 37 MDS patients. The
  analysis identified 13 cryptic chromosomal defects in 10 patients 27 . Four UPD
  affecting chromosomes 3q, 7q, 17q, and 20p , 5 deletions and 4 duplications were
  detected. Gene expression data measured on CD34 cells were available for 4 patients
  with and 6 patients without SNP-A lesions. We performed an integrative analysis
  of genotyping and gene expression microarrays and found several genes with an altered
  expression located in the aberrant regions. The expression microarrays suggested
  BMP2 and TRIB3 located in 20p UPD as potential candidate genes contributing to MDS.
  We showed that the genome-wide integrative approach is beneficial to the comprehension
  of molecular backgrounds of diseases with incompletely understood etiopathology.
