abstract: B-cell lymphoma gene BCL-6 upregulation contributes to immortalization of
  mouse embryo fibroblast and primary B cells via upregulation of cyclin D1. As cyclin
  D1 overexpression is a common phenomenon in different cancers, BCL-6 protein overexpression
  may not be restricted to lymphomas. In this study, expression of BCL-6 was investigated
  by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded specimens from 150 breast cancer patients
  and 10 specimens of normal breast tissue. The results showed BCL-6 overexpression
  amp gt or 10 of cells in 24 150 16 breast cancer patients, whereas in normal breast
  low expression amp lt 1 of BCL-6 was observed. In linear regression analysis BCL-6
  expression was associated with cyclin D1 r 0.197, P 0.016 . Further, in chi2 analyses,
  BCL-6-positivity was associated with overexpression of p53 P 0.016 , and hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1alpha P amp lt 0.001 . Involvement of BCL-6 in breast carcinogenesis is
  further underscored by comparative genomic hybridization analysis that showed gains
  at the BCL-6 locus 3q27 in 14 86 16 breast cancer tissues. The cases with amplification
  in BCL-6 showed an increased 25 incidence of BCL-6 protein overexpression. Thus,
  this study is the first to show that BCL-6 oncogene activation plays a role in cancers
  other than lymphomas.
