abstract: Alterations of chromosome 19 are among the most frequent cytogenetic changes
  in ovarian carcinomas. They usually occur as added extra material of unknown origin
  to 19p or, less frequently, 19q but sometimes as homogeneously staining regions.
  The precise nature of these markers, i.e., exactly which regions of chromosome 19
  are involved and from which chromosome s the additional material comes, could only
  rarely be established. We have investigated by high resolution array-CGH a series
  of 29 chromosome 19 markers after previous microdissection of ovarian carcinoma
  metaphases followed by FISH to determine where in chromosome 19 the rearrangements
  took place as well as from which partner chromosomes the additional material stems,
  obtaining informative results on 23 markers from 18 carcinomas. Along the entire
  chromosome 19, a total of nine regions were found gained in 10 or more carcinomas
  from 10 to 16 whereas 15 regions were gained in 6 to 10 markers. The most commonly
  gained region 16 markers was observed in 19p13 between 20.80 Mbp and 20.85 Mbp from
  19pter. According to the human genome 18 hg18 NCBI 36, a total of 43 genes reside
  in the most commonly gained regions. Most of them n 31 code for zinc finger proteins.
  None of these genes is known to be involved in human neoplasia the only exception
  is the ZNF91, which is found highly expressed in seminomas but their frequent gain
  in the examined tumors makes all of them candidates for a pathogenetic role in ovarian
  carcinogenesis.
