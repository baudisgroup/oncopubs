abstract: The outcome of pediatric ependymomas is difficult to predict based on clinical
  and histological parameters. To address this issue, we have performed a comparative
  genomic hybridization screen of 42 primary and 11 recurrent pediatric ependymomas
  and correlated the genetic findings with clinical outcome. Three distinct genetic
  patterns were identified in the primary tumors and confirmed by hierarchical cluster
  analysis. The first group of structural tumors, showed few, mainly partial imbalances
  n 19 . A second numerical group showed 13 or more chromosome imbalances with a nonrandom
  pattern of whole chromosome gains and losses n 5 . The remaining tumors n 18 showed
  a balanced genetic profile that was significantly associated with a younger age
  at diagnosis P amp lt 0.0001 , suggesting that ependymomas arising in infants are
  biologically distinct from those occurring in older children. Multivariate analysis
  showed that the structural group had a significantly worse outcome compared to tumors
  with a numerical P 0.05 or balanced profile P 0.02 . Moreover genetic group and
  extent of surgical resection contributed significantly to outcome whereas histopathology,
  age, and other clinical parameters did not. We conclude that patterns of genetic
  imbalances in pediatric intracranial ependymomas may help to predict clinical outcome.
