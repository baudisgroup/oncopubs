abstract: In order to define the ability of comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  to detect and map genetic imbalances, we investigated 47 malignant ovarian tumors
  and 2 ovarian tumors of low malignant potential. The most common genetic changes
  in order of frequency included DNA gains of chromosome arms 8q 53 , 3q 51 , 20q
  43 , 1p 32 , 19q 30 , 1q 28 , 12p 28 , 6p 21 , and 2q 19 . The smallest regions
  of overrepresentation could be defined in 3q26-qter, 8q23-qter, 1p35-pter, 12p 12,
  and 6p21-22, respectively. Losses were detected on 18q 23 , chromosome 4 23 , 13q
  17 , and 16q 17 with the smallest underrepresented regions on 18q22-qter, 13q21,
  and 16q23-qter. Also, losses of the X chromosome 19 were detected, correlating with
  higher ages of the patients. Therefore, some of these X chromosome losses might
  be due to a well-known aging phenomenon and in these cases will be more preferably
  lost during cell division and tumor progression. Our findings show that ovarian
  carcinomas reveal consistent chromosomal abnormalities. Further detailed studies
  of these regions with specific molecular genetic techniques may lead to the identification
  of oncogenes and or tumor suppressor genes playing an important role in the tumorigenesis
  of ovarian carcinomas.
