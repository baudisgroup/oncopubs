abstract: Recent studies have shown that intraductal prostate carcinoma IDC-P should
  be considered as a separate lesion distinct from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
  PIN . The purpose of the present study was to analyze the genetic relationship between
  benign prostatic tissue, PIN, invasive cancer, IDC-P, and extracapsular tumor tissue
  to get further information about the role of IDC-P in the development of prostate
  cancer. One hundred five radical prostatectomy specimens were investigated immunohistochemically,
  77 cases were analyzed by PCR for LOH of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1,
  and 11 cases of IDC-P and 10 cases of PIN were investigated using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . At CGH analysis, IDC-P showed several chromosomal imbalances
  in contrast to PIN, where no changes were found. We could demonstrate a significant
  increase of LOH for TP53 or RB1 from benign tissue to PIN. LOH of both TP53 and
  RB1 were frequently found in IDC-P 52 , followed by extracapsular tumor tissue 44
  , invasive cancer 24 , PIN 19 , and benign prostatic tissue 17 . Increased immunohistochemical
  expression was found in invasive cancer for TP53, RB1, and for PTEN. Decreased expression
  could be demonstrated in extracapsular tumor tissue and in IDC-P. Our results indicate
  that IDC-P in general follows the genetic pathway from normal epithelium over PIN
  lesion. IDC-P represents a separate prostatic lesion and should be graded as a poorly
  differentiated carcinoma.
