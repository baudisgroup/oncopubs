abstract: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm BPDCN is a rare, clinically
  aggressive malignancy with a median survival of 12-14 months. To identify pathogenetic
  relevant genomic aberrations and molecular targets for therapy, we analyzed skin
  biopsy samples obtained from 14 patients using high-resolution array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization and immunostaining. Losses of chromosomes 9, 12, 13, and 15
  were detected most frequently. Loss of the CDKN1B locus was the most common finding
  and was detected in 64 of tumors. In all but one case, the dose-dependent haploinsufficient
  cell-cycle inhibitor p27 KIP1 , encoded by CDKN1B, was weakly expressed in the nuclei
  of tumor cells. Losses of the CDKN2A-ARF-CDKN2B locus occurred in 50 of patients,
  and in one case a distinct biallelic loss was identified. The cell-cycle inhibitor
  p16 INK4a , which is encoded by CDKN2A, was not expressed in tumor cells, suggesting
  a complete loss of function. Loss of chromosome 13, including the RB1 gene, was
  observed in 43 of tumors. These results imply that alterations of the cell-cycle
  checkpoint controlling proteins p27 KIP1 , p16 INK4a , and RB1 may exert a profound
  effect in malignant transformation in BPDCN. The elucidation of the affected pathways
  may guide the development of new treatments specifically designed for this aggressive
  disease entity.
