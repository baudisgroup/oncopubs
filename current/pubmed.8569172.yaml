abstract: 'Studies investigating genetic alterations potentially constituting prognostic
  factors in glioblastoma multiforme GBM have centered mainly around amplification
  events. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a recent molecular cytogenetic
  technique that allows the detection of chromosomal imbalances and amplification
  sites in tumor DNA prepared from fresh or archival material. A group of 94 patients
  with GBM underwent surgery followed by a standard course of radiotherapy. Neuroradiologic
  monitoring with gadolinium-enhanced serial magnetic resonance imaging was applied
  to study the radiologically progression-free interval RPFI and tumor regrowth velocity.
  These parameters provided a clinical estimate of the postoperative tumor regrowth
  kinetics and yielded two clinically distinct groups. The most pronounced cases were
  selected from each group, i.e., those with the most favorable and unfavorable prognosis.
  Two subgroups with a statistically significant difference in RPFI p amp lt 0.001,
  Mann-Whitney U test containing 10 patients each were formed: Subgroup A slow tumor
  regrowth kinetics and subgroup B fast tumor regrowth kinetics . For a search of
  chromosomal alterations that might be correlated with tumor regrowth kinetics, we
  applied CGH to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from these 20 patients.
  Except for autosomes 18 and 21, all chromosomes were involved at least once in copy-number
  aberrations. Events commonly associated with GBM, i.e., gains of chromosome 7, complete
  and partial losses of 9p, 10, and 22q, were not distributed differently between
  the two subgroups. The following differences were noticeable. Gains including amplifications
  of 12q14-q21 and of 19 were observed more often in subgroup A. Losses of 6q16-qter
  and parts of 13, and gains of 20, were more frequent in subgroup B. RPFI was significantly
  shorter for patients without amplification sites than for patients with gene amplification.
  RPFI did not differ significantly between patients with or without 7p12 amplification,
  where the epidermal growth factor receptor gene is localized. New amplification
  sites for GEM tumors were revealed at 11q13 and 11q22-q23. Loss of chromosome 10
  was restricted to bands 10q25-q26 in one case. Although differences in the copy-number
  karyotypes of patients with slow and fast postoperative tumor-regrowth kinetics
  were noted, the present CGH study did not reveal any single alteration useful as
  a prognostic factor. In particular, these data do not support the assumption that
  patients suffering from GBM with amplification events would have a poorer prognosis
  than others.'
