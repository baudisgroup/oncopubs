abstract: 'Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the most common human malignant salivary gland
  tumor, can arise from both major and minor salivary glands, including sites within
  the pulmonary tracheobronchial tree. We performed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and spectral karyotyping SKY on two tumor cell lines: H3118, derived from tumor
  originating in the parotid gland, and H292, from tumor in the lung. In both cell
  lines, CGH showed a partial gain within the short arm of chromosome 7 and SKY revealed
  the presence of the previously reported reciprocal translocation t 11 19 q21 p12
  . Additional chromosomal rearrangements were found in both cell lines, including
  three more reciprocal translocations in cell line H292 t 1 16 , t 6 8 x2 and three
  other reciprocal translocations in cell line H3118 t 1 7 , t 3 15 , and t 7 15 .
  A review of the literature of other reported cases of mucoepidermoid carcinomas
  analyzed with standard G-banding techniques, as well as distinct benign salivary
  gland tumors, such as pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin tumor, confirmed the presence
  of a karyotype dominated by reciprocal translocations. Four chromosomal bands were
  involved in chromosomal translocations in both cell lines: 1q32, 5p15, 7q22, and
  15q22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed that the breakpoints in
  these four bands were often within a few megabases of each other. The involvement
  of similar chromosomal bands in breakpoints in these two cell lines suggests that
  these regions may be predisposed or selected for chromosomal rearrangements in this
  tumor type. The presence of multiple reciprocal translocations in both benign and
  malignant salivary gland tumors may also suggest a particular mechanism within mucous
  or serous glands mediating chromosomal rearrangements.'
