abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH , microsatellite instability MSI
  assays, and expression microarrays were used to molecularly subclassify a common
  set of gastric tumor samples. We identified a number of novel genomic aberrations
  associated with gastric cancer and discovered that gastric tumors could be grouped
  by their expression profiles into three broad classes: amp quot tumorigenic, amp
  quot amp quot reactive, amp quot and amp quot gastric-like. amp quot Patients with
  gastric-like tumors exhibited a significantly better overall survival than patients
  belonging to the other two classes P amp lt 0.05 . A novel supervised learning methodology
  for multiclass prediction was used to identify optimal predictor gene sets that
  accurately predicted the class of an unknown tumor sample. These predictor sets
  may prove useful in the development of new diagnostic applications for gastric cancer
  staging and prognostication.'
