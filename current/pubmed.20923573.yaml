abstract: Multiple carcinogenesis is one of the major characteristics of human hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC . The history of multiple tumors, that is, whether they derive from
  a common precancerous or cancerous ancestor or individually from hepatocytes, is
  a major clinical issue. Multiple HCC is clinically classified as either intratumor
  metastasis IM or multicentric carcinogenesis MC . Molecular markers that differentiate
  IM and MC are of interest to clinical practitioners because the clinical diagnoses
  of IM and MC often lead to different therapies.
