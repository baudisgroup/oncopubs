abstract: Tamoxifen has been a very effective treatment for breast cancer for several
  decades, however, at the same time increases the risk of endometrial cancer, especially
  after prolonged exposure. In addition, tamoxifen has been associated with a higher
  proportion of unfavorable uterine tumor subtypes carcinosarcomas and serous adenocarcinomas
  with worse survival. We investigated whether endometrial tumors, which developed
  after prolonged tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer, are genetically different
  from endometrial tumors without preceding tamoxifen exposure. Array CGH was used
  on archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded endometrial tumors to determine genomic
  aberrations. We compared the genomic profiles of 52 endometrial tumors from breast
  cancer patients after long-term amp gt or 2 years tamoxifen use endometrioid adenocarcinomas,
  n 26 carcinosarcomas, n 14 and serous adenocarcinomas, n 12 with endometrial tumors
  from unexposed breast cancer patients n 45 . Genomic profiles were correlated with
  tamoxifen exposure, tumor subtypes, and histopathological characteristics of the
  endometrial tumors. The common uterine corpus cancers of the endometrioid subtype
  show few genomic aberrations. Tumors with many genomic aberrations were in general
  ER-negative. In contrast, carcinosarcomas and serous adenocarcinomas showed many
  aberrations however, they were indistinguishable from each other. Tumors that developed
  after prolonged tamoxifen use did not show more or different aberrations than unexposed
  tumors. This was true for all tumor subtypes. Thus, endometrial carcinomas that
  develop after prolonged tamoxifen use cannot be distinguished from nonusers on basis
  of their tumor genomic profile.
