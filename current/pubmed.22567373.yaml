abstract: 'S zary syndrome SS is a rare variant of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
  Little is known about the underlying pathogenesis of S. To address this issue, we
  used Affymetrix 10K SNP microarray to analyse 13 DNA samples isolated from 8 SS
  patients and qPCR with ABI TaqMan SNP genotyping assays for the validation of the
  SNP microarray results. In addition, we tested the impact of SNP loss of heterozygosity
  LOH identified in SS cases on the gene expression profiles of SS cases detected
  with Affymetrix GeneChip U133A. The results showed: 1 frequent SNP copy number change
  and LOH involving 1, 2p, 3, 4q, 5q, 6, 7p, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12q, 13, 14, 16q, 17, and
  20, 2 reduced SNP copy number at FAT gene 4q35 in 75 of SS cases, and 3 the separation
  of all SS cases from normal control samples by SNP LOH gene clusters at chromosome
  regions of 9q31q34, 10p11q26, and 13q11q12. These findings provide some intriguing
  information for our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this
  tumour and suggest the possibility of presence of functional SNP LOH in SS tumour
  cells.'
