abstract: Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, is
  associated with a number of genetic abnormalities that are prognostically significant.
  The most common abnormalities are associated with aggressive clinical behavior and
  include deletion of distal chromosome 1p, NMYC amplification, and unbalanced gain
  of the long arm of chromosome 17. There are also other recurrent, but less frequent
  abnormalities, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. These less common
  abnormalities include deletion 3p, 11q, and 14q. To gain further clinical insight
  into some of the less commonly observed abnormalities in neuroblastoma, we performed
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis on 24 primary and metastatic neuroblastomas
  6 stage 2, 5 stage 3, 11 stage 4, and 2 stage 4 . Nineteen of these tumors were
  prechemotherapy. A total of 190 abnormalities were detected from these tumors. Four
  of the 24 tumors studied showed loss of 11q material, with 3 of these tumors also
  possessing distal chromosome 3p deletions. Our results provide confirmation that
  deletion of chromosome 3p is nonrandomly associated with deletion of chromosome
  11q in neuroblastoma. However, analysis of our results, along with other results
  reported in the literature, indicate that there is no statistically significant
  association between 3p and 11q loss and more clinically aggressive tumors.
