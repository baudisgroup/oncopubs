abstract: Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease in terms of the genetic profile
  and the response to therapeutics. An early identification of a genomic marker in
  drug discovery may help select patients that would respond to treatment in clinical
  trials. Here we suggest coupling compound screening with comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis of the model systems for early discovery of genomic biomarkers. A Bcl-2
  antagonist, ABT-737, has recently been discovered and shown to induce regression
  of solid tumors, but its activity is limited to a fraction of small-cell lung carcinoma
  SCLC models tested. We used comparative genomic hybridization on high-density single-nucleotide
  polymorphism genotyping arrays to carry out a genome-wide analysis of 23 SCLC cell
  lines sensitive and resistant to ABT-737. The screen revealed a number of novel
  recurrent gene copy number abnormalities, which were also found in an independent
  data set of 19 SCLC tumors and confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. A previously
  unknown amplification was identified on 18q and associated with the sensitivity
  of SCLC cell lines to ABT-737 and another Bcl-2 antagonist. The region of gain contains
  Bcl-2 and NOXA, two apoptosis-related genes. Expression microarray profiling showed
  that the genes residing in the amplified region of 18q are also overexpressed in
  the sensitive lines relative to the resistant lines. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
  analysis of tumors revealed that Bcl-2 gain is a frequent event in SCLC. Our findings
  suggest that 18q21-23 copy number will be a clinically relevant predictor for sensitivity
  of SCLC to Bcl-2 family inhibitors. The 18q21-23 genomic marker may have a broader
  application in cancer because Bcl-2 is associated with apoptosis evasion and chemoresistance.
