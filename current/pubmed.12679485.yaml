abstract: Medullary thyroid carcinoma MTC is a malignant tumor of the calcitonin-secreting
  parafollicular C cells of the thyroid occurring sporadically and as a component
  of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 familial medullary thyroid carcinoma
  syndrome. The primary genetic cause of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is germline
  mutation of the RET protooncogene. Somatic point mutations in RET also occur in
  sporadic MTC. Although RET mutation is likely sufficient to cause C-cell hyperplasia,
  the precursor lesion to MTC, tumor progression is thought to be due to clonal expansion
  caused by the accumulation of somatic events. Using the genome-scanning technique
  comparative genomic hybridization, we identified chromosomal imbalances that occur
  in MTC including deletions of chromosomes 1p, 3q26.3-q27, 4, 9q13-q22, 13q, and
  22q and amplifications of chromosome 19. These regions house known tumor suppressor
  genes as well as genes encoding subunits of the multicomponent complex of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked
  proteins glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptors alpha-2-4
  and their ligands glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, persephin,
  and artemin that facilitate RET dimerization and downstream signaling. Chromosomal
  imbalances in the MTC cell line TT were largely identical to those identified in
  primary MTC tumors, consolidating its use as a model for studying MTC.
