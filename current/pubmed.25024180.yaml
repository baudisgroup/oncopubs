abstract: Primary prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men but has highly
  variable outcomes, highlighting the need for biomarkers to determine which patients
  can be managed conservatively. Few large prostate oncogenome resources currently
  exist that combine the molecular and clinical outcome data necessary to discover
  prognostic biomarkers. Previously, we found an association between relapse and the
  pattern of DNA copy number alteration (CNA) in 168 primary tumors, raising the possibility
  of CNA as a prognostic biomarker. Here we examine this question by profiling an
  additional 104 primary prostate cancers and updating the initial 168 patient cohort
  with long-term clinical outcome. We find that CNA burden across the genome, defined
  as the percentage of the tumor genome affected by CNA, was associated with biochemical
  recurrence and metastasis after surgery in these two cohorts, independent of the
  prostate-specific antigen biomarker or Gleason grade, a major existing histopathological
  prognostic variable in prostate cancer. Moreover, CNA burden was associated with
  biochemical recurrence in intermediate-risk Gleason 7 prostate cancers, independent
  of prostate-specific antigen or nomogram score. We further demonstrate that CNA
  burden can be measured in diagnostic needle biopsies using low-input whole-genome
  sequencing, setting the stage for studies of prognostic impact in conservatively
  treated cohorts.
