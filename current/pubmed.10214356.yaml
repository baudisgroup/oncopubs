abstract: To evaluate the potential cytogenetic heterogeneity in breast carcinoma,
  several small cell groups each consisting of 20 to 50 cells were investigated within
  paraffin sections. By laser-microdissection, three to seven cell groups were taken
  per case. The DNA was amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR DOP-PCR
  , and the samples were analyzed by CGH for chromosomal gains and losses. Two ductal
  invasive breast carcinomas, one of them with two lymphnode metastases, were investigated.
  To compare the results from the small samples, CGH was also performed on DNA isolated
  from the tumorous regions of three to five serial sections 10 7 to 10 6 cells .
  The aberrations observed in the microdissected tumor samples were multiple and involved
  up to 14 different chromosomal or subchromosomal regions. The most frequent changes
  were gains on chromosomes 12q 14 20 and 20q 16 20 , and loss on 13q 12 20 . Some
  aberrations have rarely been detected e.g., loss on 2p, gain on 8q . Comparing chromosomal
  imbalances in primary tumors and lymph node metastases, more consistent changes
  were found between the primary tumor and its corresponding metastases than between
  both primary tumors. The laser-microdissected samples in general showed more chromosomal
  aberrations than DNA isolated from several tumor sections. Our CGH results were
  confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH for the chromosomal regions
  of centromere 1 and 20, and 20q13. In addition, microsatellite analyses on 31 samples
  confirmed our CGH findings for selected chromosome regions 2p and 11q. It can be
  concluded that there is a distinct intratumoral heterogeneity in primary breast
  tumors as well as in the corresponding lymph node metastases. The combination of
  microdissection and CGH enabled us to detect cytogenetic aberrations from important
  clones which are missed when analyzing DNA extracted from large cell numbers.
