abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ICC , a malignant neoplasm of the biliary
  epithelium,is usually fatal because of difficulty in early diagnosis and lack of
  availability of effective therapy. The genetic mechanisms involved in the development
  of ICC are not well understood and only a few cytogenetic studies of ICC have been
  published. Recently, technique of degenerate oligonucleotide primed DOP -PCR comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH permits genetic imbalances screening of the entire genome
  using only small amounts of tumor DNA. In this study chromosomal aberrations in
  33 Korean ICC were investigated by DOP-PCR CGH. The common sites of copy number
  increases were 20q 67 , 17 61 , 11q11-q13 42 , 8p12- qter 39 , 18p 39 , 15q22-qter
  36 , 16p 36 , 6p21 30 , 3q25-qter 27 , 1q41-qter 24 , and 5p14-q11.2 24 . DNA amplification
  was identified in 16 carcinomas 48 . The frequent sites of amplification were 20q,
  17p, 17q23-qter, and 7p. The most frequent sites of copy number decreases were 1p32-pter
  21 and 4q 21 . The recurrent chromosomal aberrations identified in this study provide
  candidate regions involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of ICC.
