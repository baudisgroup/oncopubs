abstract: "We used DNA content flow cytometry followed by oligonucleotide array based
  comparative genomic hybridization to survey the genomes of 326 tumors, including
  41 untreated surgically resected triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). A high level
  (log2ratio â\x89¥1) 9p24 amplicon was found in TNBC (12/41), glioblastomas (2/44),
  and colon carcinomas (2/68). The shortest region of overlap for the amplicon targets
  9p24.1 and includes the loci for PD-L1, PD-L2, and JAK2 (PDJ amplicon). In contrast
  this amplicon was absent in ER+ (0/8) and HER2+ (0/15) breast tumors, and in pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinomas (0/150). The PDJ amplicon in TNBCs was correlated with clinical
  outcomes in group comparisons by two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and
  chi-squared tests for categorical variables. TNBC patients with the PDJ amplicon
  had a worse outcome with worse disease-free and overall survival. Quantitative RT-PCR
  confirmed that the PDJ amplicon in TNBC is associated with elevated expression of
  JAK2 and of the PD-1 ligands. These initial findings demonstrate that the PDJ amplicon
  is enriched in TNBC, targets signaling pathways that activate the PD-1 mediated
  immune checkpoint, and identifies patients with a poor prognosis."
