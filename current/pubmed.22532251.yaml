abstract: Radiation-induced breast angiosarcomas are rare but recognized complication
  of breast cancer radiotherapy and are of poor prognosis. Little is known about the
  genetic abnormalities present in these secondary tumors. Herein, we investigated
  the differences in the genome and in the transcriptome that discriminate these tumors
  as a function of their etiology. Seven primary breast angiosarcomas and 18 secondary
  breast angiosarcomas arising in the irradiation field of a radiotherapy were analyzed.
  Copy number alterations and gene expression were analyzed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0
  Array and Affymetrix Exon Arrays, respectively. We showed that two transcriptome
  signatures of the radiation tumorigenesis coexisted in these tumors. One was histology
  specific and correctly discriminated 100 of the primary tumors from the radiation-induced
  tumors. The deregulation of marker genes, including podoplanin PDPN , prospero homeobox
  1 PROX-1 , vascular endothelial growth factor 3 VEGFR3 and endothelin receptor A
  EDNRA , suggests that the radiation-induced breast angiosarcomas developed from
  radiation-stimulated lymphatic endothelial cells. None of the genes of the histology-specific
  signature were present in our previously published signature of the radiation tumorigenesis
  which shows the presence of a chronic oxidative stress in radiation-induced sarcomas
  of various histologies. Nevertheless, this oxidative stress signature classified
  correctly 88 of the breast angiosarcomas as a function of the etiology. In contrast,
  MYC amplification, which is observed in all radiation-induced tumors but also at
  a low rate in primary tumors, was not a marker of the radiation tumorigenesis.
