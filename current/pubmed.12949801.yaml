abstract: Our aim was to map and compare genomic imbalances in human papillomavirus
  HPV -positive and -negative squamous cell carcinomas of the tonsil. Twenty-five
  primary carcinomas were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. Fifteen 60
  were found to be HPV-positive by PCR, and the majority were HPV-16. There were statistically
  significant differences in the distribution of DNA gains and losses between the
  HPV-positive and -negative samples. Eleven of 15 HPV-positive samples 73 showed
  gain on chromosome 3q24-qter, while only 4 10 40 HPV-negative samples had the same
  gain p 0.049 . Furthermore, 4 10 40 HPV-negative samples but no HPV-positive samples
  had gain on chromosome 7q11.2-q22 p 0.017 . As expected, and similar to previous
  studies, patients with an HPV-positive tumor had a statistically significantly better
  disease-specific survival than patients with an HPV-negative tumor p 0.002 . The
  most common changes, e.g., gain on 3q or 8q, loss on 11q or 13 and loss on chromosome
  7q in HPV-negative tumors, did not have any influence on prognosis. However the
  number of cases in each subgroup was limited.
