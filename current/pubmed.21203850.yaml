abstract: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Smoking
  is known as the strongest single factor in the development of lung cancer. However,
  there are inherited genetic factors that cause different responses to cigarette
  smoking exposure among individuals. We tried to identify these differences in heavy
  smokers by examining copy number variations CNVs between lung cancer patients and
  healthy controls. Analysis by array comparative genomic hybridization which was
  tested with 20-person training set 10 lung cancer patients, 10 healthy controls
  showed 26 significant adjusted P amp lt 0.05 clones with either copy number gains
  or losses. Three genes, KCTD11, FGF11, and PTPRH on chromosomal regions 17p13.1
  KCTD11 and FGF11 and 19q13.42 PTPRH , were selected adjusted P amp lt 0.001 and
  tested by real-time quantitative PCR with 34 healthy controls and 54 lung cancer
  patients. KCTD11 on the chromosomal region 17p13.1 showed significant high odds
  ratio OR 16.0 in heavy smokers, implying that this is a susceptibility region for
  lung cancer in this group. Therefore, CNVs of 17p13.1 is a promising candidate to
  identify individuals with a high genetic risk for the development of lung cancer.
