abstract: Identification of the genetic alterations that occur in tumors is an important
  approach to understanding tumorigenesis. We have used comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , a novel molecular cytogenetic method, to identify the gross DNA copy number
  changes that commonly occur in small cell lung cancer SCLC . We analyzed ten SCLC
  tumors seven primary tumors and three metastases from eight patients. We found frequent
  increases in DNA copy number on chromosome arms 5p, 8q, 3q, and Xq and frequent
  decreases in copy number on chromosome arms 3p, 17p, 5q, 8p, 13q, and 4p. The increase
  in copy number at 8q24 MYC and decreases at 17p13 TP53 , 13q14 RB , and 3p have
  previously been identified in SCLC with other methods. Many of the other regions
  in which we detected common copy number changes have not been reported to be regions
  of common alteration in SCLC tumors. Comparison of copy number changes between a
  primary tumor and a metastasis from the same patient showed that they were more
  closely related to each other than to any of the other tumors. The results of direct
  CGH analysis of SCLC tumors reported here confirm the existence of copy number changes
  that we identified previously by using cell lines.
