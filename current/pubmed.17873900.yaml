abstract: Primary carcinomas of the small intestine are rare and the mechanism of
  their pathogenesis is poorly understood. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis
  FAP have a high risk of developing duodenal carcinomas. The aim of this study is
  to gain more insight into the development of duodenal carcinomas. Therefore, five
  FAP-related duodenal carcinomas were characterized for chromosomal and methylation
  alterations, which were compared to those observed in sporadic duodenal carcinomas.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent
  probe amplification MS-MLPA was performed in 10 primary sporadic and five primary
  FAP-related duodenal carcinomas. In the FAP-related carcinomas, frequent gains were
  observed on chromosomes 8, 17 and 19, whereas in sporadic carcinomas they occurred
  on chromosomes 8, 12, 13 and 20. In 60 of the sporadic carcinomas, gains in the
  regions of chromosome 12 were observed which were absent in the FAP-related carcinomas
  P 0.04 . Hypermethylation was observed in the immunoglobulin superfamily genes member
  4 IGSF4 , TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 TIMP3 , Estrogen receptor 1 ESR1 , adenomatous
  polyposis coli APC , H-cadherin CDH13 and paired box gene 6 PAX6 genes. Hypermethylation
  of PAX6 was only observed in FAP-related carcinomas 3 5 and not in sporadic carcinomas
  P 0.02 . In conclusion, in contrast to sporadic duodenal carcinomas, gains on chromosome
  12 were not observed in duodenal carcinomas of patients with FAP. Identification
  of the genes in these regions of chromosome 12 could lead to a better understanding
  of the carcinogenesis pathways leading to sporadic and FAP-related duodenal carcinomas.
  Furthermore, hypermethylation seems to be a general feature of both FAP-related
  duodenal carcinomas as well as sporadic duodenal carcinomas with the exception of
  the PAX6 gene, which is methylated only in FAP-related carcinomas.
