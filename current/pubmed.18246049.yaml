abstract: Renal tumors with complex or unusual morphology require extensive workup
  for accurate classification. Chromosomal aberrations that define subtypes of renal
  epithelial neoplasms have been reported. We explored if whole-genome chromosome
  copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP arrays can be used to identify these aberrations and classify renal epithelial
  tumors. We analyzed 20 paraffin-embedded tissues representing clear cell, papillary
  renal and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, as well as oncocytoma with Affymetrix
  GeneChip 10K 2.0 Mapping arrays. SNP array results were in concordance with known
  genetic aberrations for each renal tumor subtype. Additional chromosomal aberrations
  were detected in all renal cell tumor types. The unique patterns allowed 19 out
  of 20 tumors to be readily categorized by their chromosomal copy number aberrations.
  One papillary renal cell carcinoma type 2 did not show the characteristic 7 17 trisomies.
  Clustering using the median copy number of each chromosomal arm correlated with
  histological class when using a restricted set of chromosomes. In addition, three
  morphologically challenging tumors were analyzed to explore the potential clinical
  utility of this method. In these cases, the SNP array-based copy number evaluation
  yielded information with potential clinical value. These results show that SNP arrays
  can detect characteristic chromosomal aberrations in paraffin-embedded renal tumors,
  and thus offer a high-resolution, genome-wide method that can be used as an ancillary
  study for classification and potentially for prognostic stratification of these
  tumors.
