abstract: MicroRNAs miRNAs are an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs that function
  as negative gene regulators. miRNA deregulation is involved in the initiation and
  progression of human cancer however, the underlying mechanism and its contributions
  to genome-wide transcriptional changes in cancer are still largely unknown. We studied
  miRNA deregulation in human epithelial ovarian cancer by integrative genomic approach,
  including miRNA microarray n 106 , array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  n 109 , cDNA microarray n 76 , and tissue array n 504 . miRNA expression is markedly
  down-regulated in malignant transformation and tumor progression. Genomic copy number
  loss and epigenetic silencing, respectively, may account for the down-regulation
  of approximately 15 and at least approximately 36 of miRNAs in advanced ovarian
  tumors and miRNA down-regulation contributes to a genome-wide transcriptional deregulation.
  Last, eight miRNAs located in the chromosome 14 miRNA cluster Dlk1-Gtl2 domain were
  identified as potential tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, our results suggest that
  miRNAs may offer new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in epithelial ovarian cancer.
