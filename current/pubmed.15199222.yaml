abstract: The pancreatic adenocarcinoma genome harbors multiple amplifications and
  deletions, pointing to the existence of numerous oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes driving the genesis and progression of this lethal cancer. Here, array comparative
  genomic hybridization on a cDNA microarray platform and informatics tools have been
  used to define the copy number alterations in a panel of 24 pancreatic adenocarcinoma
  cell lines and 13 primary tumor specimens. This high-resolution genomic analysis
  has identified all known regional gains and losses as well as many previously uncharacterized
  highly recurrent copy number alterations. A systematic prioritization scheme has
  selected 64 focal minimal common regions MCRs of recurrent copy number change. These
  MCRs possess a median size of 2.7 megabases Mb , with 21 33 MCRs spanning 1 Mb or
  less median of 0.33 Mb and possessing an average of 15 annotated genes. Furthermore,
  complementary expression profile analysis of a significant fraction of the genes
  residing within these 64 prioritized MCRs has enabled the identification of a subset
  of candidates with statistically significant association between gene dosage and
  mRNA expression. Thus, the integration of DNA and RNA profiles provides a highly
  productive entry point for the discovery of genes involved in the pathogenesis of
  pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
