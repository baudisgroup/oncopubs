abstract: Oncomirs are microRNAs miRNA that acts as oncogenes or tumor suppressor
  genes. Efficient identification of oncomirs remains a challenge. Here we report
  a novel, clinically guided genetic screening approach for the identification of
  oncomirs, identifying mir-30d through this strategy. mir-30d regulates tumor cell
  proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and migration. The chromosomal locus harboring
  mir-30d was amplified in more than 30 of multiple types of human solid tumors n
  1,283 . Importantly, higher levels of mir-30d expression were associated significantly
  with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer patients n 330, P 0.0016 . Mechanistic
  investigations suggested that mir-30d regulates a large number of cancer-associated
  genes, including the apoptotic caspase CASP3. The guided genetic screening approach
  validated by this study offers a powerful tool to identify oncomirs that may have
  utility as biomarkers or targets for drug development.
