abstract: Human germ cell tumors GCTs of neonates and infants comprise a heterogeneous
  group of neoplasms, including teratomas and yolk sac tumors with distinct clinical
  and epidemiologic features. As yet, little is known about the cytogenetic constitution
  of these tumors. We applied the recently developed genomewide array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH technology to 24 GCTs derived from patients under
  the age of 5 years. In addition, we included seven tumors derived from children
  and adolescents older than 5 years. In the series from those under the age of 5
  years, most teratomas displayed normal profiles, except for some minor recurrent
  aberrations. In contrast, the yolk sac tumors displayed recurrent losses of 1p35-pter
  and gains of 3p21-pter and of 20q13. In the GCTs of patients older than 5 years,
  the main recurrent anomalies included gains of 12p and of whole chromosomes 7 and
  8. In addition, gains of the 1q32-qter region and losses of the 6q24-qter and 18q21-qter
  regions were frequent in GCTs of varied histology, independent of age. We concluded
  that array CGH is a highly suitable method for identifying recurrent chromosomal
  anomalies in GCTs of neonates and infants. The recurrent anomalies observed point
  to chromosomal regions that may harbor novel diagnostic prognostic identifiers and
  genes relevant to the development of these neoplasms.
