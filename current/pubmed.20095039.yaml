abstract: 'Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 is a common abnormality associated
  with myeloid malignancies. We characterized abnormalities of chromosome 20 as defined
  by metaphase cytogenetics MC in patients with myeloid neoplasms to define commonly
  deleted regions CDR and commonly retained regions CRR using genome-wide, high resolution
  single nucleotide polymorphism array SNP-A analysis. We reviewed the MC results
  of a cohort of 1,162 patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic
  syndromes MDS , MDS myeloproliferative neoplasia MDS MPN , and acute myeloid leukemia
  AML . We further analyzed a subcohort of 532 patients by SNP-A using the Affymetrix
  Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Nsp arrays. By MC,
  5 54 1,162 harbored a deletion of 20q in 30 16 54 , del 20q was the sole cytogenetic
  abnormality. By SNP-A analysis, we identified del 20q in 23 patients, 3 not detected
  by MC. In four cases, monosomy 20 with a marker chromosome by MC was proven to be
  an interstitial deletion of 20q by SNP-A. We defined 2 CDR and 2 CRR on chromosome
  arm 20q: CDR1 spanned 2.5 Mb between bands 20q11.23 and 20q12, while CDR2 encompassed
  1.8 Mb within 20q13.12. CRR1 spanned 1.9 Mb within 20q11.21 and CRR2 encompassed
  2.5 Mb within 20q13.33. In contrast to other chromosomes frequently affected by
  deletions, no somatic copy neutral loss of heterozygosity CN-LOH was detected. Our
  data suggest that SNP-A is useful for the detection of cryptic aberrations of chromosome
  20q and allows for a more precise characterization of complex karyotypes. Furthermore,
  SNP-A allowed definition of a CDR on 20q.'
