abstract: Chronic myeloid leukemia CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized
  by the presence in leukemic stem cells of the Philadelphia chromosome Ph and the
  formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion. Untreated, the disease progresses to accelerate
  phase and blast crisis in which hematopoietic differentiation has become arrested.
  CML progression is frequently associated with cytogenetic evidence of clonal evolution,
  defined as additional chromosomal aberrations. We here report a CML resistant to
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors that rapidly progressed to blastic phase. At this time,
  array CGH performed on CD34 cells revealed cryptic partial deletions of both PRDM16
  and RUNX1 and duplication of the der 21 chromosome. These genomic rearrangements
  were confirmed by FISH with probes targeting the deletion on chromosome 21 24 kb
  , and with BAC probes flanking the deletion on 1p36 220 kb . However, no cryptic
  t 1 21 p36 q22 and or RUNX1-PRDM16 were detected, suggesting that these deletions
  are the residual hallmarks of a more complex mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement,
  as indicated by the additional inversion of the region bounded by 1p36.32 and 1p36.12
  breaks. At the molecular level, these abnormalities lead to the overexpression of
  the PR-domain negative oncogenic isoform of PRDM16, associated with two deleted
  copies within the runt domain of C-teminal aberrant RUNX1. These events are not
  detectable by conventional cytogenetic and molecular strategies, and may be of underestimated
  frequency in disease progression.
