abstract: Although a number of genes related to melanoma development have been identified
  through candidate gene screening approaches, few studies have attempted to conduct
  such analyses on a genome-wide scale. Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide
  polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss
  of heterozygosity LOH and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines.
  In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p 72
  , 10p 55 , 10q 55 , 9q 49 , 6q 43 , 11q 43 , and 17p 41 . Tumor suppressor genes
  TSGs can be identified through homozygous deletion HD . We detected 174 HDs, the
  most common of which targeted CDKN2A n 33 . The second highest frequency of HD occurred
  in PTEN n 8 , another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD n
  7 and HDAC4 n 3 , TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types.
  Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the
  characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications,
  including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF n 9 , NRAS n 3 , BRAF n 3
  , and CCND1 n 3 . Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important
  in the development of a subset of melanomas. The numerous focal amplifications and
  HDs we have documented here are the first step toward identifying a comprehensive
  catalog of genes involved in melanoma development, some of which may be useful prognostic
  markers or targets for therapies to treat this disease.
