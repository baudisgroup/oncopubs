abstract: It has become increasingly clear that the cells within the tumor microenvironment
  play a critical role in cancer growth and metastasis. Studies in experimental models
  suggest that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts CAF differ from normal fibroblasts
  and are capable of promoting cancer progression through a variety of mechanisms.
  At present, a definitive view is lacking on whether genomic abnormalities are present
  and whether they might underlie the observed phenotypic differences. This study
  reports the molecular analysis of the largest series of breast CAFs reported to
  date, with an array comparative genomic hybridization-based DNA copy number analysis
  of cultured CAFs derived from 25 freshly resected human breast cancers. We found
  DNA copy number changes consisting of the whole arm of chromosomes 6p and 9p plus
  interstitial 4q loss in only one sample. No abnormalities were observed in non-tumor-associated
  fibroblast counterparts. Karyotyping of the same CAF revealed further chromosomal
  abnormalities, which included clonal loss of chromosomes, chromosomal duplications,
  and less frequent chromosomal rearrangements. These abnormalities were not associated
  with alterations in the global gene expression profile of this particular CAF, relative
  to its non-tumor-associated fibroblast counterpart. Moreover, this particular patients
  CAF also displayed the only p53 mutation in the cohort, the first time such a mutation
  has been reported in freshly cultured human CAFs. These findings argue that the
  procancerous effects of CAFs are unlikely to be due to DNA copy number-type genomic
  abnormalities in the CAFs themselves. As such, breast CAFs should be mainly regarded
  as genomically stable cellular constituents that exist within complex cancer microenvironments.
