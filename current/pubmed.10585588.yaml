abstract: 'Although ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS of the breast is accepted as a potential
  precursor lesion for invasive ductal cancer IDC , the critical genetic events associated
  with the tumor progression remain unknown. Since some extensive DCIS may show a
  small focus of IDC, these cases seem to be particularly suitable to investigate
  the primary abnormalities that determine the progression from in situ to early invasive
  cancer. We combined laser-microdissection with degenerative oligonucleotide-primed
  PCR DOP-PCR and comparative genomic hybridization CGH to detect copy number changes
  in 7 cases of extensive amp gt 4 cm DCIS with 1 small adjacent invasive focus. In
  3 of the cases, single lymph node metastases LN were already present and were also
  investigated. Analysis of DCIS, IDC and LN components in the same patients revealed
  several consistent chromosomal changes present at all 3 sites: 1q, 7q, 8q, 16, 17,
  19, 20q, 21q and 22q, the most frequent losses on 4q, 11q and 13q. DNA gain on 3p
  and 12q were more frequently found in IDC than in DCIS, suggesting the presence
  of proto-oncogenes activated during the progression to invasive cancer on these
  regions. Using paired analysis, resemblence of alterations found in DCIS and IDC
  could be quantified odds ratio 7.0, p amp lt or 0.01 . Gains on 6p, 10q, 14q and
  15q and losses on 9p were identified in DCIS and IDC but not in LN, which may, therefore,
  represent early events in the carcinogenic process. Additional losses were found
  in the LNs on 2q, 3q, 5q, 6q, 12q and 16q. CGH results on chromosome 1 and 20 were
  confirmed by FISH and on chromosomal region 9p by microsatellite analyses. Our findings
  strongly underline the precursor status of high-grade DCIS, in which most of the
  chromosomal changes identified in IDC are already present. However, although the
  early stages of breast cancer, i.e., DCIS and the small foci of IDC were mainly
  characterized by DNA gains, the progression to metastatic tumor LN must have involved
  additional DNA losses on several regions.'
