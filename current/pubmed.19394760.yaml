abstract: The genomic aberration profile of chromosome 20q in distal CIN colon carcinomas
  was analysed using allelotyping and CGH arrays. Allelotyping revealed carcinomas
  with allelic imbalance along the full long arm, and carcinomas with fully non-aberrant
  20q. Oligonucleotide-based CGH showed that among the carcinomas without allelic
  imbalance, 47 had in fact a gain. In this subgroup, quantitative PCR for the TOPI
  gene 20q12 confirmed this gain, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that
  the chromosome 20q gain resulted from tetra polysomy instead of aneusomy. The 20q
  gain correlated with a high frequency of aberrations, with allelic imbalance at
  TP53 locus but not at APC locus, and carcinomas with a disomic 20q showed low frequency
  of genomic aberrations and were significantly associated to mucinous phenotype.
  The prognostic value of 20q amplification was not demonstrated in this study. These
  results indicate that on the basis of aberration frequency, chromosome 20q and TP53
  APC locus status, distal CIN carcinomas harbor a high degree of genetic heterogeneity
  suggesting several pathways for carcinogenesis. This study also indicates that allelotyping
  needs to be carried out with a complementary technique, such as quantitative PCR.
