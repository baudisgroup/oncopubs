abstract: The ability to perform comprehensive profiling of cancers at high resolution
  is essential for precision medicine. Liquid biopsies using shed exosomes provide
  high-quality nucleic acids to obtain molecular characterization, which may be especially
  useful for visceral cancers that are not amenable to routine biopsies.  We isolated
  shed exosomes in biofluids from three patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers (two
  pancreatic, one ampullary). We performed comprehensive profiling of exoDNA and exoRNA
  by whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500
  sequencer. We assessed the feasibility of calling copy number events, detecting
  mutational signatures and identifying potentially actionable mutations in exoDNA
  sequencing data, as well as expressed point mutations and gene fusions in exoRNA
  sequencing data.  Whole-exome sequencing resulted in 95%-99% of the target regions
  covered at a mean depth of 133-490ï¿½. Genome-wide copy number profiles, and high
  estimates of tumor fractions (ranging from 56% to 82%), suggest robust representation
  of the tumor DNA within the shed exosomal compartment. Multiple actionable mutations,
  including alterations in NOTCH1 and BRCA2, were found in patient exoDNA samples.
  Further, RNA sequencing of shed exosomes identified the presence of expressed fusion
  genes, representing an avenue for elucidation of tumor neoantigens.  We have demonstrated
  high-resolution profiling of the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of visceral
  cancers. A wide range of cancer-derived biomarkers could be detected within the
  nucleic acid cargo of shed exosomes, including copy number profiles, point mutations,
  insertions, deletions, gene fusions and mutational signatures. Liquid biopsies using
  shed exosomes has the potential to be used as a clinical tool for cancer diagnosis,
  therapeutic stratification and treatment monitoring, precluding the need for direct
  tumor sampling.  ï¿½ The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf
