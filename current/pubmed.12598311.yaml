abstract: We have used prostate cancer, the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous neoplasm
  among men, to investigate the feasibility of performing genomic array analyses of
  archival tissue. Prostate-specific antigen and a biopsy Gleason grade have not proven
  to be accurate in predicting clinical outcome, yet they remain the only accepted
  biomarkers for prostate cancer. It is likely that distinct spectra of genomic alterations
  underlie these phenotypic differences, and that once identified, may be used to
  differentiate between indolent and aggressive tumors. Array comparative genomic
  hybridization allows quantitative detection and mapping of copy number aberrations
  in tumors and subsequent associations to be made with clinical outcome. Archived
  tissues are needed to have patients with sufficient clinical follow-up. In this
  report, 20 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded prostate cancer samples originating
  from 1986 to 1996 were studied. We present a straightforward protocol and demonstrate
  the utility of archived tissue for array comparative genomic hybridization with
  a 2400 element BAC array that provides high-resolution detection of both deletions
  and amplifications.
