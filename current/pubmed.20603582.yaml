abstract: Patients with ALL rarely present with t 12 17 p13 q21 as the primary clonal
  abnormality this abnormality is associated with the expression of myeloid antigens.
  In this study, we have reported presumably the first case of this chromosomal abnormality
  in Korea, thereby facilitating the delineation of a distinct subtype of ALL. A 57-yr-old
  woman was referred to our hospital because of pancytopenia. Peripheral blood examination
  showed 55 blasts. The bone marrow was markedly hypercellular, and about 82.4 of
  all nucleated cells were blasts. The results of immunophenotyping and cytochemical
  staining suggested early precursor B-ALL. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow
  cells showed a complex karyotype, including a reciprocal translocation between the
  short arm of chromosome 12 and the long arm of chromosome 17, t 12 17 p13 q21 .
  Data from array comparative genomic hybridization were almost consistent with the
  cytogenetic findings.
