abstract: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and accounts for
  over one million new cases worldwide per year. Lymph node-negative breast cancer
  patients are reputed as having a better prognosis than lymph node-positive ones.
  Around 20 of the lymph node-negative patients die within 10 years after diagnosis.
  To improve the prognostics of node-negative breast cancer, it is important to understand
  the underlying biologic mechanisms promoting survival, such as specific genetic
  changes in the tumor genome. In this study, CGH was applied to analyze 64 tumors
  from node-negative breast cancer patients to identify DNA copy number changes in
  chromosomes and chromosome regions that may be correlated to survival. The main
  findings show gains at 4q, 5q31 approximately qter, 6q12 approximately q16, and
  12q14 approximately q22, as well as losses of 17p, 18p, and Xq, which were significantly
  more recurrent in tumors from deceased patients than in tumors from survivors. The
  average number of chromosomal changes was higher in the tumors from deceased compared
  to the survivor tumors. Our findings suggest that tumors with specific chromosomal
  aberrations at 4q, 5q31 approximately qter, 6q12 approximately q16, 12q14 approximately
  q22, 17p, 18p, and Xq result in an aggressive form of breast cancer and that these
  patients are predisposed to succumb to breast cancer.
