abstract: Nine human malignant gliomas 2 astrocytomas grade III and 7 glioblastomas
  were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . In addition to the amplification
  of the EGFR gene at 7p12 in 4 of 9 cases, six new amplification sites were mapped
  to 1q32, 4q12, 7q21.1, 7q21.2-3, 12p, and 22q12. Nonrandom chromosomal gains and
  losses were identified with overrepresentation of chromosome 7 and underrepresentation
  of chromosome 10 as the most frequent events 1 of 2 astrocytomas, 7 of 7 glioblastomas
  . Gain of a part or the whole chromosome 19 and losses of chromosome bands 9pter-23
  and 22q13 were detected each in five cases. Loss of chromosome band 17p13 and gain
  of chromosome 20 were revealed each in three cases. The validity of the CGH data
  was confirmed using interphase cytogenetics with YAC clones, chromosome painting
  in tumor metaphase spreads, and DNA fingerprinting. A comparison of CGH data with
  the results of chromosome banding analyses indicates that metaphase spreads accessible
  in primary tumor cell cultures may not represent the clones predominant in the tumor
  tissue.
