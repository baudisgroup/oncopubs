abstract: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Chinese women. The aim of
  the present study was to investigate the genetic alterations that occur in breast
  cancer cells in Chinese women. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis
  was performed on 34 tumors obtained from patients with primary invasive ductal breast
  carcinoma (IDC). Recurrent genetic alterations in breast cancer include gains on
  chromosomes 1q (59%), 16p (50%), 17q (44%), 8q (38%), 11q (32%), 20q (32%), 1p (24%),
  20p (24%), 19q (21%) and 19p (18%). Losses are common on chromosomes 6q (15%), 8p
  (12%), 18 (12%), 4q (9%), X (9%) and 17p (9%). In the present study, high-level
  amplifications were observed on chromosomes 1q32, 8p, 11q13, 17q and 20q. Overall,
  the chromosomal DNA gains observed were consistent with the changes reported in
  Caucasian populations. However, the incidence of chromosomal DNA loss was lower
  in the present study compared with the incidence reported in the literature. The
  present results demonstrate the pattern of chromosomal imbalances in the invasive
  ductal breast carcinomas of Chinese females.
