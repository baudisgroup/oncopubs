abstract: Breast cancer exhibits clinical and molecular heterogeneity, where expression
  profiling studies have identified five major molecular subtypes. The basal-like
  subtype, expressing basal epithelial markers and negative for estrogen receptor
  ER , progesterone receptor PR and HER2, is associated with higher overall levels
  of DNA copy number alteration CNA , specific CNAs like gain on chromosome 10p ,
  and poor prognosis. Discovering the molecular genetic basis of tumor subtypes may
  provide new opportunities for therapy. To identify the driver oncogene on 10p associated
  with basal-like tumors, we analyzed genomic profiles of 172 breast carcinomas. The
  smallest shared region of gain spanned just seven genes at 10p13, including calcium
  calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID CAMK1D , functioning in intracellular signaling
  but not previously linked to cancer. By microarray, CAMK1D was overexpressed when
  amplified, and by immunohistochemistry exhibited elevated expression in invasive
  carcinomas compared to carcinoma in situ. Engineered overexpression of CAMK1D in
  non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells led to increased cell proliferation, and
  molecular and phenotypic alterations indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  EMT , including loss of cell-cell adhesions and increased cell migration and invasion.
  Our findings identify CAMK1D as a novel amplified oncogene linked to EMT in breast
  cancer, and as a potential therapeutic target with particular relevance to clinically
  unfavorable basal-like tumors.
