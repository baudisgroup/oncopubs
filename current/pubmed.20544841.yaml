abstract: A multiplatform approach, including conventional cytogenetic techniques,
  BAC array comparative genomic hybridization, and Affymetrix 500K SNP arrays, was
  applied to the study of the tumor genomes of 25 follicular lymphoma biopsy samples
  with paired normal DNA samples to characterize balanced translocations, copy number
  imbalances, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity cnLOH . In addition to the t
  14 18 , eight unique balanced translocations were found. Commonly reported FL-associated
  copy number regions were revealed including losses of 1p32-36, 6q, and 10q, and
  gains of 1q, 6p, 7, 12, 18, and X. The most frequent regions affected by copy-neutral
  loss of heterozygosity were 1p36.33 28 , 6p21.3 20 , 12q21.2-q24.33 16 , and 16p13.3
  24 . We also identified by SNP analysis, 45 aberrant regions that each affected
  one gene, including CDKN2A, CDKN2B, FHIT, KIT, PEX14, and PTPRD, which were associated
  with canonical pathways involved in tumor development. This study illustrates the
  power of using complementary high-resolution platforms on paired tumor normal specimens
  and computational analysis to provide potential insights into the significance of
  single-gene somatic aberrations in FL tumorigenesis.
