abstract: Cell lines provide a powerful model to study cancer and here we describe
  a new spontaneously immortalised epithelial ovarian cancer cell line (NUOC-1) derived
  from the ascites collected at a time of primary debulking surgery for a mixed endometrioid
  / clear cell / High Grade Serous (HGS) histology.This spontaneously immortalised
  cell line was found to maintain morphology and epithelial markers throughout long-term
  culture. NUOC-1 cells grow as an adherent monolayer with a doubling time of 58 hours.
  The cells are TP53 wildtype, positive for PTEN, HER2 and HER3 expression but negative
  for oestrogen, progesterone and androgen receptor expression. NUOC-1 cells are competent
  in homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, but base excision repair
  defective. Karyotype analysis demonstrated a complex tetraploid karyotype. SNP array
  analysis of parent and derived subpopulations (NUOC-1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2) cells demonstrated
  heterogeneous cell populations with numerous copy number alterations and a pro-amplification
  phenotype. The characteristics of this new cell line lends it to be an excellent
  model for investigation of a number of the identified targets.The cell line has
  been characterised for growth, drug sensitivity, expression of common ovarian markers
  and mutations, clonogenic potential and ability to form xenografts in SCID mice.
  Copy number changes and clonal evolution were assessed by SNP arrays.
