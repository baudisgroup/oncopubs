abstract: To identify recurrent genomic changes in mantle cell lymphoma MCL , we used
  high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization CGH to bacterial artificial chromosome
  BAC microarrays in 68 patients and 9 MCL-derived cell lines. Array CGH defined an
  MCL genomic signature distinct from other B-cell lymphomas, including deletions
  of 1p21 and 11q22.3-ATM gene with coincident 10p12-BMI1 gene amplification and 10p14
  deletion, along with a previously unidentified loss within 9q21-q22. Specific genomic
  alterations were associated with different subgroups of disease. Notably, 11 patients
  with leukemic MCL showed a different genomic profile than nodal cases, including
  8p21.3 deletion at tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL
  receptor gene cluster 55 versus 19 P .01 and gain of 8q24.1 at MYC locus 46 versus
  14 P .015 . Additionally, leukemic MCL exhibited frequent IGVH mutation 64 versus
  21 P .009 with preferential VH4-39 use 36 versus 4 P .005 and followed a more indolent
  clinical course. Blastoid variants, increased number of genomic gains, and deletions
  of P16 INK4a and TP53 genes correlated with poorer outcomes, while 1p21 loss was
  associated with prolonged survival P .02 . In multivariate analysis, deletion of
  9q21-q22 was the strongest predictor for inferior survival hazard ratio HR , 6 confidence
  interval CI , 2.3 to 15.7 . Our study highlights the genomic profile as a predictor
  for clinical outcome and suggests that amp quot genome scanning amp quot of chromosomes
  1p21, 9q21-q22, 9p21.3-P16 INK4a, and 17p13.1-TP53 may be clinically useful in MCL.
