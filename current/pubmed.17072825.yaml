abstract: Urothelial neoplasms in patients 19 years of age or younger are rare, and
  the data regarding clinical outcome are conflicting. Molecular data are not available.
  Urothelial tumours from 14 patients aged 4 to 19 years were analysed, including
  FGFR3 and TP53 mutation screening, comparative genomic hybridization CGH , UroVysion
  FISH analysis, polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus HPV , microsatellite
  analysis using the NIH consensus panel for detection of microsatellite instability
  MSI and six markers for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome arms 9p, 9q, and 17p
  and immunohistochemistry for TP53, Ki-67, CK20 and the mismatch repair proteins
  MRPs hMSH2, hMLH1, and hMSH6. Based on the 2004 WHO classification, one urothelial
  papilloma, seven papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential PUNLMPs
  , five low-grade, and one high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma were included.
  No multifocal tumours were found and recurrence was seen in only one patient with
  a urothelial papilloma. All patients were alive with no evidence of disease at a
  median follow-up of 3.0 years. We found no mutations in FGFR3, deletions of chromosome
  arms 9p, 9q or 17p, MSI or MRP loss, or HPV positivity in any of the patients. Three
  cases showed chromosome alterations in CGH analyses, urothelial dedifferentiation
  with CK20 overexpression, or aneuploidy, and one TP53 mutation with TP53 overexpression
  was found. Urothelial neoplasms in people younger than 20 years are predominantly
  low grade and are associated with a favourable clinical outcome. Genetic alterations
  frequently seen in older adults are extremely rare in young patients. Urothelial
  neoplasms in children and young adults appear to be biologically distinct and lack
  genetic instability in most cases.
