abstract: 'Distinction of adrenocortical carcinoma from benign adrenocortical lesions
  by standard criteria is often difficult. In order to search for additional diagnostic
  parameters, a series of 25 adrenocortical tumors, 8 adenomas, 14 primary carcinomas,
  1 metastasis, and the 2 adrenocortical carcinoma cell lines SW13 and NCI-H295 were
  analyzed by the approach of comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Except for the
  two smallest adenomas, all tumors showed chromosomal imbalances with a high incidence
  of chromosomal gains, most frequently involving chromosomes or chromosome arms 5,
  7, 8, 9q, 11q, 12q, 14q, 16, 17q, 19, 20, and 22q. The only significant loss of
  material concerned the distal part of 9p. Furthermore, 21 high-level amplifications
  were identified in 15 different regions of the genome. The consensus regions of
  recurrent gains and the focal high-level amplifications allowed identification of
  a series of chromosomal subregions containing candidate proto-oncogenes of potential
  pathogenic function in adrenocortical tumors: 1p34.3-pter, 1q22-q25, 3p24-pter,
  3q29, 7p11.2-p14, 9q34, 11q12-11q13, 12q13, 12q24.3, 13q34, 14q11.2-q12, 14q32,
  16p, 17q24-q25, 19p13.3, 19q13.4, and 22q11.2-q12. A subset of the CGH data was
  independently confirmed by interphase cytogenetics. Interestingly, the adenomas
  larger than 4 cm contained gained material of regions also overrepresented in carcinomas.
  In addition, several chromosomal gains, in particular the high-level amplifications,
  were exclusive for the malignant status of the tumors. These data indicate that
  the larger adrenal lesions need to be carefully considered in the diagnosis of adrenocortical
  tumors, and that genetic aberrations might provide useful markers for a better diagnostic
  differentiation.'
