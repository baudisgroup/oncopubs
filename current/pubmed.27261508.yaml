abstract: Melanoma often recurs after a latency period of several years, presenting
  a T cell-edited phenotype that reflects a role for CD8(+) T cells in maintaining
  metastatic latency. Here, we report an investigation of a patient with multiple
  recurrent lesions, where poorly immunogenic melanoma phenotypes were found to evolve
  in the presence of autologous tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Melanoma cells
  from two of three late recurrent metastases, developing within a 6-year latency
  period, lacked HLA class I expression. CD8(+) T cell-resistant, HLA class I-negative
  tumor cells became clinically apparent 1.5 and 6 years into stage IV disease. Genome
  profiling by SNP arrays revealed that HLA class I loss in both metastases originated
  from a shared chromosome 15q alteration and independently acquired focal B2M gene
  deletions. A third HLA class I haplotype-deficient lesion developed in year 3 of
  stage IV disease that acquired resistance toward dominant CD8(+) T-cell clonotypes
  targeting stage III tumor cells. At an early stage, melanoma cells showed a dedifferentiated
  c-Jun(high)/MITF(low) phenotype, possibly associated with immunosuppression, which
  contrasted with a c-Jun(low)/MITF(high) phenotype of T cell-edited tumor cells derived
  from late metastases. In summary, our work shows how tumor recurrences after long-term
  latency evolve toward T-cell resistance by independent genetic events, as a means
  for immune escape and immunotherapeutic resistance. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4347-58.
