abstract: Development of mesothelioma is linked mainly to asbestos exposure, but the
  combined contributions of genetic and epigenetic alterations are unclear. We investigated
  the potential relationships between gene copy number CN alterations and DNA methylation
  profiles in a case series of pleural mesotheliomas n 23 . There were no instances
  of significantly correlated CN alteration and methylation at probed loci, whereas
  averaging loci over their associated genes revealed only two genes with significantly
  correlated CN and methylation alterations. In contrast to the lack of discrete correlations,
  the overall extent of tumor CN alteration was significantly associated with DNA
  methylation profile when comparing CN alteration extent among methylation profile
  classes. Further, there was evidence that this association was partially attributable
  to prevalent allele loss at the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT1. Our findings define
  a strong association between global genetic and global epigenetic dysregulation
  in mesothelioma, rather than a discrete, local coordination of gene inactivation.
