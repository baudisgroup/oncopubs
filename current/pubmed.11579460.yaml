abstract: 'Cytogenetic information on chordomas is rudimentary and restricted to GTG-banding
  analysis of 26 cases worldwide. In this study, we present the chromosomal imbalances
  detected in a series of 16 chordomas 10 sacrococcyeal, five sphenooccipital, and
  one spinal from 13 patients using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH . On average, 3.2 losses and 4.2 gains were detected
  per tumor. The most common DNA copy number alterations were losses on chromosomal
  arms 3p 50 and 1p 44 . Losses of 3p were detected in five of seven primary chordomas.
  Therefore, the loss of 3p might be an early event in chordoma genesis. The most
  common gains involved 7q 69 , 20 50 , 5q 38 , and 12q 38 . Additionally, we raised
  the first human chordoma cell line, U-CH1, from a recurrence of a sacral chordoma.
  U-CH1 and its parent tumor had almost the same CGH profile. According to GTG-banding
  and multicolor FISH, U-CH1 has the following clonal chromosomal abnormalities: der
  1 t 1 22 , del 4 , del 5 , del 6 , 7, del 9 , del 10 , der 20 t 10 20 , 21. Thus,
  the novel permanent human chordoma cell line U-CH1 has chordoma-typical cytogenetic
  aberrations. Our data suggest that tumor suppressor genes or mismatch repair genes
  located at 1p31 and 3p14 and oncogenes located in 7q36 might be involved in chordoma
  genesis.'
