abstract: H rthle cell thyroid neoplasms are classified as variants of follicular
  neoplasms, but they have distinct clinicopathological features. Chromosomal aberrations
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH are common in H rthle cell neoplasms. However,
  there is currently only limited information concerning the relationship between
  the chromosomal aberrations by CGH and tumor behavior. We, therefore, investigated
  chromosomal aberrations in primary H rthle cell neoplasms 13 carcinomas and 15 adenomas
  using CGH and correlated the aberrations identified with tumor node metastasis TNM
  stage, tumor differentiation, capsular invasion, and tumor recurrence. Chromosomal
  aberrations were found in 62 8 of 13 of carcinomas and 60 9 of 15 of adenomas. Overall,
  common chromosomal gains were found on 5p 29 , 5q 36 , 7 29 , 12p 14 , 12q 21 ,
  17p 29 , 17q 32 , 19p 32 , 19q 25 , 20p 21 , 20q 29 , and 22q 18 . Common chromosomal
  losses were found on 2q 18 and 9q 18 . Thirty-eight percent 5 of 13 of carcinomas
  were TNM stage III, 31 4 of 13 were moderately to poorly differentiated, and 46
  6 of 13 were intermediately to widely invasive. Recurrence occurred in 38 5 of 13
  . Carcinomas that subsequently recurred had a greater number of chromosomal gains
  9.0 vs. 1.3 amp lt 0.005 and had more frequent chromosomal gains on 12q, 19q, and
  20p amp lt 0.001 , 5p, 7, 19p, and 20q amp lt 0.005 , and 12p amp lt 0.01 than those
  that did not recur. Five of the eight 63 patients with aberrations developed recurrence,
  whereas none of the five patients without aberrations developed recurrence. In conclusion,
  chromosomal gains by CGH on 5p, 7, 12p, 12q, 19p, 19q, 20p, and 20q in H rthle cell
  carcinomas are associated with tumor recurrence. Such chromosomal aberrations may
  be predictive for recurrent disease in patients with H rthle cell thyroid carcinoma.
