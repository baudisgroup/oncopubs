abstract: Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) identifies a high-risk
  subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), requiring intensive treatment to
  reduce their relapse risk. Improved understanding of the genomic landscape of iAMP21-ALL
  will ascertain whether these patients may benefit from targeted therapy. We performed
  whole-exome sequencing of eight iAMP21-ALL samples. The mutation rate was dramatically
  disparate between cases (average 24.9, range 5-51) and a large number of novel variants
  were identified, including frequent mutation of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Targeted
  sequencing of a larger cohort revealed that 60% (25/42) of diagnostic iAMP21-ALL
  samples harboured 42 distinct RAS pathway mutations. High sequencing coverage demonstrated
  heterogeneity in the form of multiple RAS pathway mutations within the same sample
  and diverse variant allele frequencies (VAFs) (2-52%), similar to other subtypes
  of ALL. Constitutive RAS pathway activation was observed in iAMP21 samples that
  harboured mutations in the predominant clone (â©¾35% VAF). Viable iAMP21 cells from
  primary xenografts showed reduced viability in response to the MEK1/2 inhibitor,
  selumetinib, in vitro. As clonal (â©¾35% VAF) mutations were detected in 26% (11/42)
  of iAMP21-ALL, this evidence of response to RAS pathway inhibitors may offer the
  possibility to introduce targeted therapy to improve therapeutic efficacy in these
  high-risk patients.Leukemia advance online publication, 10 May 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.80.
