abstract: There are few reliable markers to distinguish tumors with aggressive characteristics
  from others at the time of initial diagnosis in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
  The purpose of this study was to identify a genomic marker that allows the prediction
  of prognosis for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers. We screened the genome-wide
  copy number in 41 patients with non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the
  bladder by array-based comparative genomic hybridization using arrays spotted with
  4,030 bacterial artificial chromosome clones. A loss of 8p23.3 clone 923 was correlated
  significantly with a higher histological grade P 0.0026 and advanced pathological
  stage P 0.0148 . Both recurrence-free and progression-free survival rates were lower
  in patients with tumors without 8p23.3, compared with those with 8p23.3 P 0.0146
  and 0.0473, respectively log-rank test . These data suggest that the loss of 8p23.3
  is a novel genomic marker allowing estimation of biological characteristics of non-muscle-invasive
  bladder cancer.
