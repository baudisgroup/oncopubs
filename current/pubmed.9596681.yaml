abstract: 'In contrast to low-grade B-cell lymphomas originating in the gastrointestinal
  GI tract, only few cytogenetic data are available for the large cell, highly malignant
  variants. We studied 31 large B-cell lymphomas of the GI tract by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization using specific DNA probes
  FISH . The most frequent aberrations were gains of all or of parts of chromosomes
  11 11 cases , 12 9 cases , 1q 4 cases , and 3q 4 cases . Losses of parts of chromosome
  6q and of parts of the short arm of chromosome 17 6 cases each were found most frequently.
  In four cases a total of seven high-level DNA amplifications was detected. In two
  of these cases, involvement of specific protooncogenes REL and MYC was shown. Some
  genetic aberrations seemed to be associated with an inferior clinical course: patients
  with amp gt 2 aberrations had a significantly shorter median survival. Furthermore,
  all patients with gains of all or parts of chromosome arm 1q and with high-level
  DNA amplifications as well as seven of nine patients with gains of all or parts
  of chromosome 12 died of lymphoma. In conclusion, the pattern of chromosomal gains
  and losses in large B-cell lymphomas was different from data reported for low-grade
  MALT lymphomas of the stomach and bowel, especially with respect to the high incidence
  of partial gains of chromosome arm 11q and of all or parts of chromosome 12 and
  the low frequency of polysomy 3. In addition, our data suggest that chromosomal
  gains and losses detected by CGH and FISH may predict for the outcome of patients
  with this tumor entity.'
