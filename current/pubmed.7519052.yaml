abstract: Well-differentiated liposarcomas WDLPS are frequently characterized by a
  near-diploid karyotype with supernumerary ring and or giant rod-shaped marker chromosomes.
  We have shown, using fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH and molecular strategies,
  that these markers contain chromosome 12-derived sequences. Here we report the analysis
  of six WDLPS for the presence of amplified DNA segments by means of the recently
  developed comparative genomic hybridization CGH strategy. Two distinct chromosome
  12-derived amplification units could be identified in all tumors examined, one located
  in the q14-q15 region as expected, the second unexpectedly mapping to q21.3-q22.
  Our results indicate that the concerted amplification of these two distinct regions
  on the long arm of chromosome 12 may be a consistent characteristic of WDLPS. These
  amplifications are most likely directly related to the presence of supernumerary
  ring and or giant marker chromosomes in this group of soft tissue tumors.
