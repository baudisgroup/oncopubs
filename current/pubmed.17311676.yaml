abstract: Cervical carcinoma develops as a result of multiple genetic alterations.
  Different studies investigated genomic alterations in cervical cancer mainly by
  means of metaphase comparative genomic hybridization mCGH and microsatellite marker
  analysis for the detection of loss of heterozygosity LOH . Currently, high throughput
  methods such as array comparative genomic hybridization array CGH , single nucleotide
  polymorphism array SNP array and gene expression arrays are available to study genome-wide
  alterations. Integration of these 3 platforms allows detection of genomic alterations
  at high resolution and investigation of an association between copy number changes
  and expression.
