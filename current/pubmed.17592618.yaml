abstract: Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors stPNETs and medulloblastomas
  have long been thought to arise from a common cell type in the subventricular germinal
  matrix. Because of the infrequent occurrence of stPNETs, little is known about their
  genetic background. Here, we performed a genome-wide screening for DNA copy-number
  aberrations in 10 supratentorial PNETs using array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  array-CGH . Comparing our findings with data from a previous array-CGH study on
  47 medulloblastomas, we identified differences in the frequency of copy-number losses
  at chromosome regions 1p12-22.1 and 9p, and gains at 19p, all of them more frequently
  occurring in stPNETs. In contrast to previous reports, we detected chromosome 17
  aberrations by array-CGH in 2 10 stPNETs. To validate our findings obtained by array-CGH,
  we analyzed the loci of interest by fluorescence in situ hybridization in an independent
  set of 11 stPNETs and found deletions of 9p21 in 5 11 tumors of the second set,
  three of them being homozygous. All 9p21 deletions were associated with loss of
  CDKN2A protein expression. Altogether, CDKN2A deletions were detected in 7 21 stPNETs
  including four homozygous deletions, whereas such deletions were only found in 4
  112 medulloblastomas, all of these being heterozygous P amp lt 0.001 . Gains of
  19p 14 vs. 0 in medulloblastomas, P 0.02 were found to be significantly more frequent
  in stPNETs, whereas gains of 17q 14 vs. 45 in medulloblastomas, P 0.02 were confirmed
  to be more frequent in medulloblastomas. These data further support the hypothesis
  of two different tumor entities of embryonal neuroepithelial tumors with characteristic
  genetic aberrations. c 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
