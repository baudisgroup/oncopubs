abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkins
  lymphoma and exhibits aggressive and heterogeneous clinical behavior. To genetically
  characterize DLBCL, we established our own array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  and analyzed a total of 70 cases 26 CD-positive CD5 DLBCL and 44 CD5-negative CD5-
  DLBCL cases . Regions of genomic aberrations observed in amp gt 20 of cases of both
  the CD5 and CD5- groups were gains of 1q21-q31, 1q32, 3p25-q29, 5p13, 6p21-p25,
  7p22-q31, 8q24, 11q23-q24, 12q13-q21, 16p13, 18, and X and losses of 1p36, 3p14,
  6q14-q25, 6q27, 9p21, and 17p11-p13. Because CD5 expression marks a subgroup with
  poor prognosis, we subsequently analyzed genomic gains and losses of CD5 DLBCL compared
  with those of CD5-. Although both groups showed similar genomic patterns of gains
  and losses, gains of 10p14-p15 and 19q13 and losses of 1q43-q44 and 8p23 were found
  to be characteristic of CD5 DLBCL. By focusing on the gain of 13q21-q34 and loss
  of 1p34-p36, we were also able to identify prognostically distinct subgroups among
  CD5 DLBCL cases. These results suggest that array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis provides a platform of genomic aberrations of DLBCL both common and specific
  to clinically distinct subgroups.
