abstract: We examined copy number changes in the genomes of B cells from 58 patients
  with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL by using representational oligonucleotide
  microarray analysis ROMA , a form of comparative genomic hybridization CGH , at
  a resolution exceeding previously published studies. We observed at least 1 genomic
  lesion in each CLL sample and considerable variation in the number of abnormalities
  from case to case. Virtually all abnormalities previously reported also were observed
  here, most of which were indeed highly recurrent. We observed the boundaries of
  known events with greater clarity and identified previously undescribed lesions,
  some of which were recurrent. We profiled the genomes of CLL cells separated by
  the surface marker CD38 and found evidence of distinct subclones of CLL within the
  same patient. We discuss the potential applications of high-resolution CGH analysis
  in a clinical setting.
