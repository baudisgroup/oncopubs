abstract: Phyllodes tumors are not quite rare fibroepithelial neoplasms of the breast
  that show a broad spectrum of clinical behaviour. The molecular genetic features
  of the heterogenous groups of neoplasms have not been studied in detail yet. We
  have used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze chromosomal copy number changes
  in 36 cases of phyllodes tumors including benign, borderline and malignant phyllodes
  tumors, 12 cases each . The average number of chromosome copy changes range in benign,
  borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors were 5.58 0-20 , 14.08 3-23 , and 12.42
  0-29 respectively. In benign phyllodes tumors the number of gains and losses was
  in balance 2.50 vs 3.08 , while in borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors gains
  occurred more often than losses 9.25 vs 4.83, 9.5 vs 2.92 . The result suggests
  the molecular cytogenetics of borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors is similar,
  and the most striking difference with benign phyllodes tumors is an increased number
  of chromosomal gains in a nonrandom distribution. Gains of 4q12 seem especially
  to be involved in the progression of benign to borderline and malignant phyllodes
  tumors, possibly because of overexpression of oncogenes at these loci.
