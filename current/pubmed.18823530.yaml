abstract: The amplification event occurring at chromosome locus 11q13, reported in
  several different cancers, includes a number of potential oncogenes. We have previously
  reported amplification of one such oncogene, namely CCND1, to be correlated with
  an adverse effect of tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer patients. Over-expression
  of cyclin D1 protein, however, confers tamoxifen resistance but not a tamoxifen-induced
  adverse effect. Potentially, co-amplification of an additional 11q13 gene, with
  a resulting protein over-expression, is required to cause an agonistic effect. Moreover,
  during 11q13 amplification a deletion of the distal 11q region has been described.
  In order to assess the potential impact of the deletion we examined a selected marker
  for this event.
