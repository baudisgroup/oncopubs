abstract: 'Alterations of DNA copy number are believed to be important indicators
  of tumor progression in human astrocytoma. We used an array of bacterial artificial
  chromosomes to map relative DNA copy number in 50 primary glioblastoma multiforme
  tumors at approximately 1.4-Mb resolution. We identified 33 candidate sites for
  amplification and homozygous deletion in these tumors. We identified three major
  genetic subgroups within these glioblastoma multiforme tumors: tumors with chromosome
  7 gain and chromosome 10 loss, tumors with only chromosome 10 loss in the absence
  of chromosome 7 gain, and tumors without copy number change in chromosomes 7 or
  10. The significance of these genetic groups to therapeutics needs further study.'
