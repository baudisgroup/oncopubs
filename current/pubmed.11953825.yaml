abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is a disease of significant clinical
  importance, which arises in the presence or absence of human papillomavirus. We
  used comparative genomic hybridisation to document non-random chromosomal gains
  and losses within human papillomavirus positive and negative vulvar cancers. Gain
  of 3q was significantly more common in human papillomavirus-positive cancers compared
  to human papillomavirus-negative cancers. The smallest area of gain was 3q22-25,
  a chromosome region which is frequently gained in other human papillomavirus-related
  cancers. Chromosome 8q was more commonly gained in human papillomavirus-negative
  compared to human papillomavirus-positive cancers. 8q21 was the smallest region
  of gain, which has been identified in other, non-human papillomavirus-related cancers.
  Chromosome arms 3p and 11q were lost in both categories of vulvar cancer. This study
  has demonstrated chromosome locations important in the development of vulvar squamous
  cell carcinoma. Additionally, taken together with previous studies of human papillomavirus-positive
  cancers of other anogenital sites, the data indicate that one or more oncogenes
  important in the development and progression of human papillomavirus-induced carcinomas
  are located on 3q. The different genetic changes seen in human papillomavirus-positive
  and negative vulvar squamous cell carcinomas support the clinicopathological data
  indicating that these are different cancer types.
