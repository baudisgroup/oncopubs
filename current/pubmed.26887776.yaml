abstract: 'Dysregulation of MYC is the genetic hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) but
  it is encountered in other aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas. MYC dysregulation
  needs other cooperating events for BL development. We aimed to characterize these
  events and assess the differences between adult and paediatric BLs that may explain
  the different outcomes in these two populations. We analysed patterns of genetic
  aberrations in a series of 24 BLs: 11 adults and 13 children. We looked for genomic
  imbalances (copy number variations), copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH)
  and mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, ID3 (exon 1), TCF3 (exon17) and CCND3 (exon 6). Young
  patients displayed more frequent 13q31.3q32.1 amplification, 7q32q36 gain and 5q23.3
  CN-LOH, while 17p13 and 18q21.3 CN-LOH were only detected in adult BLs. ID3 mutations
  were present in all adult samples, but only in 42% of childhood cases. CCND3 and
  ID3 double-hit mutations, as well as 18q21 CN-LOH, seemed to be associated with
  poorer outcome. For the first time, we report different genetic anomalies between
  adult and paediatric BLs, suggesting age-related heterogeneity in Burkitt lymphomagenesis.
  This may explain the poorer prognosis of adult BLs. Additional studies are needed
  to confirm these results in the setting of clinical trials.'
