abstract: Within the subgroup of lymph node-negative breast cancers, there is a need
  for accurate prognostic indicators to select high-risk patients. Comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH provides an opportunity to screen the whole genome for chromosomal
  aberrations which may be associated with poor clinical outcome. The results of CGH
  analysis of 53 lymph node-negative breast carcinomas are presented and correlated
  with a set of clinico-pathological and cytometric features with strong prognostic
  value. The most frequent chromosomal gains were, in descending order of frequency,
  8q, 1q, Xq, 5q, 4q, and 3q. Recurring losses were observed at chromosomal arms 19p,
  1p, 17p, 22q, 4q, and 8p. There was not a single, unique combination of chromosomal
  aberrations, but gains of 1q and 8q were frequently observed simultaneously 15 53
  cases . DNA aneuploid tumours harboured more gains than DNA diploid tumours, but
  there was no correlation between the total number of events per tumour detected
  by CGH and any of the prognostic features. Of the many chromosomal aberrations found,
  only gains of chromosome 8q were strongly correlated with high values of mean nuclear
  area. A clearer picture was obtained when comparing only those cases which, according
  to their cytometric and morphometric features, had either the worst or the best
  prognosis. Gains occurred mainly in the poor prognostic features group, in particular
  at 8q, 11q13, 17q, and 20q. It is hypothesized that these gains could be late, progression-related
  events and may be associated with aggressive clinical behaviour. These four chromosomal
  regions may therefore be of potential prognostic value. Correlation with real follow-up
  data will enable us better to identify those patients who have a high risk of recurrence
  within the subgroup of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients.
