abstract: 'We analysed the molecular genetic profiles of breast cancer samples before
  and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with combination doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
  AC . DNA was obtained from microdissected frozen breast core biopsies from 44 patients
  before chemotherapy. Additional samples were obtained before the second course of
  chemotherapy D21 and after the completion of the treatment surgical specimens in
  17 and 21 patients, respectively. Microarray-based comparative genome hybridisation
  was performed using a platform containing approximately 5800 bacterial artificial
  chromosome clones genome-wide resolution: 0.9 Mb . Analysis of the 44 pretreatment
  biopsies revealed that losses of 4p, 4q, 5q, 12q13.11-12q13.12, 17p11.2 and 17q11.2
  and gains of 1p, 2p, 7q, 9p, 11q, 19p and 19q were significantly associated with
  oestrogen receptor negativity. 16q21-q22.1 losses were associated with lobular and
  8q24 gains with ductal types. Losses of 5q33.3-q4 and 18p11.31 and gains of 6p25.1-p25.2
  and Xp11.4 were associated with HER2 amplification. No correlations between DNA
  copy number changes and clinical response to AC were found. Microarray-based comparative
  genome hybridisation analysis of matched pretreatment and D21 biopsies failed to
  identify statistically significant differences, whereas a comparison between matched
  pretreatment and surgical samples revealed a statistically significant acquired
  copy number gain on 11p15.2-11p15.5. The modest chemotherapy-driven genomic changes,
  despite profound loss of cell numbers, suggest that there is little therapeutic
  selection of resistant non-modal cell lineages.'
