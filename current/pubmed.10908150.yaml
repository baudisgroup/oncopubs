abstract: 'Chromosomal information on germ cell tumors of the infantile testis, ie,
  teratomas and yolk sac tumors, is limited and controversial. We studied two teratomas
  and four yolk sac tumors using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and in situ
  hybridization. No chromosomal anomalies were found in the teratomas by any of the
  methods, not even after CGH on microdissected tumor cells. All yolk sac tumors showed
  aneuploidy, loss of parts of 4q and 6q, and gain of parts of 20q. Underrepresentation
  of parts of 8q and overrepresentation of parts of 3p, 9q, 12p, 17, 19q, and 22 were
  detected in most cases. In addition, one recurrent yolk sac tumor after a sacral
  teratoma was studied, showing a highly similar pattern of imbalances. While CGH
  demonstrated loss of 1p36 in one testicular yolk sac tumor, in situ hybridization
  revealed loss of this region in all yolk sac tumors. High-level amplification of
  the 12q13-q14 region was found in one yolk sac tumor. MDM2, of which the encoding
  gene maps to this chromosomal region, was found in all cases using immunohistochemistry,
  whereas no p53 could be detected. Accordingly, no mutations within exons 5 to 8
  of the p53 gene were observed. These data prove the absence of gross chromosomal
  aberrations in teratomas of the infantile testis and show a characteristic pattern
  of gains and losses in the yolk sac tumors. Besides confirmation of previously found
  anomalies, recurrent losses of 1p21-31 and 4q23-33 and gains of 9q34 and 12p12-13
  have not been reported before. While genetic inactivation of p53 seems unimportant
  in the pathogenesis of these tumors, biochemical inactivation by MDM2 might be involved.
  These data support the existence of three entities of germ cell tumors of the human
  testis: teratomas and yolk sac tumors of infants, seminomas and nonseminomas of
  adolescents and young adults, and spermatocytic seminomas of the elderly, each with
  its own specific pathogenesis.'
