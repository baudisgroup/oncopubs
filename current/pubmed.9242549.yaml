abstract: Gene activation by translocation between an oncogene and an immunoglobulin
  heavy-chain gene, which leads to increased expression of the oncoprotein, is a well-known
  mechanism in the genesis of B-cell lymphomas. In contrast, the role of gene amplification
  in activation of oncogenes in non-Hodgkins lymphomas is poorly characterized. To
  study the BCL2 amplification we performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  , Southern blot hybridization, Western analysis, immunohistochemistry, metaphase
  fluorescence in situ hybridization, and chromosome analysis on 26 cases of diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma large noncleaved cell lymphoma . The gain or high-level amplification
  of 18q was found in eight tumors 31 by CGH, and Southern analysis revealed BCL2
  amplification in these cases, but not in the cases with normal chromosome 18 or
  t 14 18 q32 q21 . Western immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed
  a high-level expression of BCL2 protein in the cases with BCL2 amplification and
  t 14 18 q32 q21 . However, translocation 14 18 q32 q21 was not detected in any of
  the cases with BCL2 amplification. Therefore, our results suggest that amplification
  of the BCL2 gene is an important mechanism for BCL2 protein overexpression in diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma.
