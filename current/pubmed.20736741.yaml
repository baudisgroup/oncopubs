abstract: Chromosomal imbalances are commonly seen in cancer and inherited genetic
  diseases. These imbalances may assist in the diagnosis, prognosis, and or therapeutic
  management of certain neoplasms. Several methods for detecting chromosomal imbalances,
  such as, fluorescent in situ hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization,
  and single nucleotide polymorphism SNP arrays have proven useful in formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded FFPE tissues. Here, we report the performance and reproducibility
  of virtual karyotyping of FFPE tissues with Affymetrix SNP arrays.
