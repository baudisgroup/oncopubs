abstract: Genomic aberrations are of predominant importance to the biology and clinical
  outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL , and FISH-based genomic
  risk classifications are routinely used in clinical decision making in CLL. One
  of the known limitations of CLL FISH is the inability to comprehensively interrogate
  the CLL genome for genomic changes. In an effort at overcoming the existing limitations
  in CLL genome analysis, we have analyzed high-purity DNA isolated from FACS-sorted
  CD19 cells and paired CD3 or buccal cells from 255 patients with CLL for acquired
  genomic copy number aberrations aCNAs with the use of ultra-high-density Affymetrix
  SNP 6.0 arrays. Overall,  2 subchromosomal aCNAs were found in 39 100 of 255 of
  all cases analyzed, whereas  3 subchromosomal aCNAs were detected in 20 50 of 255
  of cases. Subsequently, we have correlated genomic lesion loads genomic complexity
  with the clinical outcome measures time to first therapy and overall survival. With
  the use of multivariate analyses incorporating the most important prognostic factors
  in CLL together with SNP 6.0 array-based genomic lesion loads at various thresholds,
  we identify elevated CLL genomic complexity as an independent and powerful marker
  for the identification of patients with aggressive CLL and short survival.
