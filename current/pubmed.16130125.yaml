abstract: Small-cell lung cancer SCLC is a highly aggressive lung neoplasm, which
  accounts for 20 of yearly lung cancer cases. The lack of knowledge of the progenitor
  cell type for SCLC precludes the definition of a normal gene expression profile
  and has hampered the identification of gene expression changes, while the low resolution
  of conventional genomic screens such as comparative genomic hybridization CGH and
  loss of heterozygosity analysis limit our ability to fine-map genetic alterations.
  The recent advent of whole genome tiling path array CGH enables profiling of segmental
  DNA copy number gains and losses at a resolution 100 times that of conventional
  methods. Here we report the analysis of 14 SCLC cell lines and six matched normal
  B-lymphocyte lines. We detected 7p22.3 copy number gain in 13 of the 14 SCLC lines
  and 0 of the 6 matched normal lines. In 4 of the 14 cell lines, this gain is present
  as a 350 kbp gene specific copy number gain centered at MAD1L1 the human homologue
  of the yeast gene MAD1 . Fluorescence in situ hybridization validated the array
  CGH finding. Intriguingly, MAD1L1 has been implicated to have tumor-suppressing
  functions. Our data suggest a more complex role for this gene, as MAD1L1 is the
  most frequent copy number gain in SCLC cell lines.
