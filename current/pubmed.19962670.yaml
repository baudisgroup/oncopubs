abstract: Advanced stage papillary serous tumors of the ovary are responsible for
  the majority of ovarian cancer deaths, yet the molecular determinants modulating
  patient survival are poorly characterized. Here, we identify and validate a prognostic
  gene expression signature correlating with survival in a series of microdissected
  serous ovarian tumors. Independent evaluation confirmed the association of a prognostic
  gene microfibril-associated glycoprotein 2 MAGP2 with poor prognosis, whereas in
  vitro mechanistic analyses demonstrated its ability to prolong tumor cell survival
  and stimulate endothelial cell motility and survival via the alpha V beta 3 integrin
  receptor. Increased MAGP2 expression correlated with microvessel density suggesting
  a proangiogenic role in vivo. Thus, MAGP2 may serve as a survival-associated target.
