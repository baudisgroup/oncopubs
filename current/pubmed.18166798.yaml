abstract: The biologic mechanisms involved in the clinical progression from early
  stages of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL are not well known. We
  investigated sequential samples from 16 untreated CLL patients obtained at diagnosis
  in early stage and after progression before treatment. One patient had a p16 INK4a
  homozygous deletion at diagnosis and progression, and 3 patients acquired a p53
  mutation, gains of 5q21-q23 and 11pter-p14, and a gain of chromosome 12 respectively,
  during the progression of the disease. Gene expression profile analysis showed a
  significant modulation of 58 genes with a particular downregulation of genes that
  are inhibitors of cell adhesion and motility.
