abstract: The comprehensive cytogenetic profiles of a panel of 10 Burkitts lymphoma
  BL -derived B cell lines, designated Akata, BL-28, BL-41, Daudi, DG-75, Mutu I,
  Mutu III, Namalwa, Rael, and Ramos, respectively, are reported herein. The unique
  origin of each cell line was established using multiplex quantitative fluorescence
  polymerase chain reaction QF-PCR . Spectral karyotyping SKY revealed a large number
  of structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations, many of which had not been
  previously identified or resolved by conventional G-banding techniques. Notably,
  whereas all 10 cell lines harbored the hallmark translocation t 8 14 q24 q32 , no
  other common structural aberrations were identified, although translocations involving
  chromosomes 3, 13, and 17 were frequently seen. Moreover, analysis of chromosomal
  breakpoints by comparative genomic hybridization CGH revealed a number of recurring
  aberrations, such as gain of chromosomes 7 and 20, gains of regions at 2p, 3q, 13q
  and 16q, and losses at 3p, 4q and 17p. In addition, apoptyping i.e. determination
  of in vitro responses to apoptosis stimulation of the cell lines suggested specific
  association patterns between karyotypic changes e.g. translocations involving 17p,
  and gains of portions of chromosomes 7 and 20 and resistance to the chemotherapeutic
  agent, etoposide. The current molecular cytogenetic characterization of 10 BL cell
  lines has thus identified several novel sites of rearrangements moreover, the combined
  karyotyping and functional assessment apoptyping of these cell lines serves to enhance
  their utility in future studies aimed at gene discovery and gene function.
