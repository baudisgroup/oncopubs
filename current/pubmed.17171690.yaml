abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs comprise a biologically diverse group
  of neoplasms with respect to activating mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA, histology,
  anatomical site of origin, and clinical aggressiveness. In this study, we applied
  the high resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH technology
  to 66 primary GISTs 40 gastric and 26 nongastric, 48 with KIT and 18 with PDGFRA
  mutations for identification of novel high-level alterations and for characterization
  of genotype-related genomic changes. All cases had genomic imbalances with the highest
  occurrence of 14q 73 , 1p 62 , 22q 59 , 15q 38 , and 13q 29 losses. Our data indicate
  that loss of chromosome 14 and or 22 is an early change in GIST tumorigenesis irrespective
  of tumor genotype. Furthermore, DNA copy number changes showed a site dependent
  pattern. These included lower incidence of losses at 14q 87 vs. 35 , and higher
  frequency of losses at 1p 45 vs. 85 and 15q 17 vs. 69 in nongastric versus gastric
  site P amp lt 0.001 for all . However, in the multivariate analysis with adjustment
  to tumor risk stratification, only the 14q loss site-dependent pattern of distribution
  retained its significance. These findings suggest that loss of 14q is a relatively
  less frequent genetic event in the development of nongastric GISTs, the lack of
  which is most likely substituted by the accumulation of 1p 15q and other changes.
  The novel minimal overlapping regions of deletion at 1p 1p36.32-1p35.2, 1p34.1,
  and 1p22.1-1p21.3 , 13q 13q14.11-q14.2 and 13q32.3-q33.1 , and 15q23 were delineated,
  which point to chromosomal regions that may harbor genes relevant to the development
  of these neoplasms.
