abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is typically a very aggressive disease with poor
  outcomes, but some cases display an indolent behavior that might not necessitate
  treatment at diagnosis. To define molecular criteria that might permit recognition
  of such cases, we compared the clinicopathologic features, gene expression, and
  genomic profile of patients who had indolent or conventional disease iMCL or cMCL
  . Patients with iMCL displayed nonnodal leukemic disease with predominantly hypermutated
  IGVH and noncomplex karyotypes. iMCL and cMCL shared a common gene expression profile
  that differed from other leukemic lymphoid neoplasms. However, we identified a signature
  of 13 genes that was highly expressed in cMCL but underexpressed in iMCL. SOX11
  was notable in this signature and we confirmed a restriction of SOX11 protein expression
  to cMCL. To validate the potential use of SOX11 as a biomarker for cMCL, we evaluated
  SOX11 protein expression in an independent series of 112 cases of MCL. Fifteen patients
  with SOX11-negative tumors exhibited more frequent nonnodal presentation and better
  survival compared with 97 patients with SOX11-positive MCL 5-year overall survival
  of 78 versus 36 , respectively P 0.001 . In conclusion, we defined nonnodal presentation,
  predominantly hypermutated IGVH, lack of genomic complexity, and absence of SOX11
  expression as qualities of a specific subtype of iMCL with excellent outcomes that
  might be managed more conservatively than cMCL.
