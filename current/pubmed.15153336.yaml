abstract: Identification of target genes for genetic rearrangements in prostate cancer
  and the impact of copy number changes on gene expression are currently not well
  understood. Here, we applied high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  on cDNA microarrays for analysis of prostate cancer cell lines. CGH microarrays
  identified most of the alterations detected by classic chromosomal CGH, as well
  as a number of previously unreported alterations. Specific recurrent regions of
  gain 28 and loss 18 were found, and their boundaries defined with sub-megabasepair
  accuracy. The most common changes included copy number decreases at 13q, and gains
  at 1q and 5p. Refined mapping identified several sites, such as at 13q 33-44, 49-51,
  and 74-76 Mbp from the p-telomere , which matched with minimal regions of loss seen
  in extensive loss of heterozygosity mapping studies of large numbers of tumors.
  Previously unreported recurrent changes were found at 2p, 2q, 3p, and 17q losses
  , and at 3q, 5p, and 6p gains . Integration of genomic and transcriptomic data revealed
  the role of individual candidate target genes for genomic alterations as well as
  a highly significant P amp lt .0001 overall association between copy number levels
  and the percentage of differentially expressed genes. Across the genome, the overall
  impact of copy number on gene expression levels was, to a large extent, attributable
  to low-level gains and losses of copy number, corresponding to common deletions
  and gains of often large chromosomal regions.
