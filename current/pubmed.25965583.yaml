abstract: It is well known that chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development
  of hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the
  causes behind aberrant expression of inflammation-related genes occurred in HCC
  remain unclear.  We performed array-based analyses to comprehensively investigate
  the contributions of DNA methylation and somatic copy number aberration (SCNA) to
  the aberrant expression of 1,027 inflammation-related genes in 30 HCCs and paired
  non-tumor tissues. The results were validated in public datasets and an additional
  sample set of 47 paired HCCs and non-tumor tissues.  We identified 252 differentially
  expressed, 125 aberrantly methylated and 287 copy number changed inflammation-related
  genes. Despite reasonable statistical power, among them, only 11 genes and 56 genes
  whose aberrant expression was associated with DNA methylation or SCNA, respectively.
  DNA methylation and SCNA together contributed to less than 30% aberrant expression
  of inflammation-related genes.  These results suggest that molecular mechanisms
  other than DNA methylation and SCNA might play major role in the regulation of aberrant
  expression of inflammation-related gene in HBV-related HCCs.
