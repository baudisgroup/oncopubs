abstract: Gliomas are common malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system. Among
  the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are distinguished by their remarkable
  sensitivity to chemotherapy, with approximately two thirds of anaplastic malignant
  oligodendrogliomas responding dramatically to combination treatment with procarbazine,
  lomustine, and vincristine termed PCV . Unfortunately, no clinical or pathologic
  feature of these tumors allows accurate prediction of their response to chemotherapy.
  Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas also are distinguished by a unique constellation of
  molecular genetic alterations, including coincident loss of chromosomal arms 1p
  and 19q in 50 -70 of tumors. We have hypothesized that these or other specific genetic
  changes might predict the response to chemotherapy and prognosis in patients with
  anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Therefore, we have analyzed molecular genetic alterations
  involving chromosomes 1p, 10q, and 19q and the TP53 on chromosome 17p and CDKN2A
  on chromosome 9p genes, in addition to clinicopathologic features in 39 patients
  with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas for whom chemotherapeutic response and survival
  could be assessed.
