abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia AML that occurs concurrent with a diagnosis of chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia CLL is rare, but the number of cases recognized has recently
  dramatically increased as a result of the application of flow cytometry. This raises
  a series of questions regarding the clinical characterization of mixed leukemia,
  whether this diagnosis possesses unique cytogenetic abnormalities, and the possible
  association between AML and CLL cell clones. The current study attempts to answer
  these questions by evaluating an 80-year-old man with concurrent diagnoses of AML-M0
  and CLL. Routine G-banded chromosome, array based comparative genomic hybridization,
  and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were used to characterize complex
  chromosomal rearrangements in the patients bone marrow. Novel complex translocations
  involving chromosomes 2, 5, and 11, as well as submicroscopic deletions and duplications,
  were revealed. This case study reports a t 2 5 11 in either AML-M0 or in CLL by
  using array based comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  analyses to facilitate the diagnosis. The study also delineates the clinical characteristics
  and cytogenetic changes that occur with concurrent AML and CLL.
