abstract: 'Testicular germ cell tumours of adults and adolescents TGCT include seminomas
  SE and nonseminomas NS , with spermatocytic seminomas SSE representing a distinct
  entity in older men. SE and NS have gain of 12p material in all cases, whereas SSE
  are associated with overrepresentation of chromosome 9. Here, we compare at the
  chromosomal level, copy number imbalances with global expression changes, identified
  by comparative expressed sequence hybridisation analyses, in seven SE, one combined
  tumour, seven NS and seven cell lines. Positive correlations were found consistent
  with copy number as a main driver of expression change, despite reported differences
  in methylation status in SE and NS. Analysis of chromosomal copy number and expression
  data could not distinguish between SE and NS, in-keeping with a similar genetic
  pathogenesis. However, increased expression from 4q22, 5q23.2 and 9p21 distinguished
  SSE from SE and NS and decreased copy number and expression from 2q36-q37 and 6q24
  was a specific feature of NS-derived cell lines. Our analysis also highlights 19
  regions with both copy number and expression imbalances in greater than 40 of cases.
  Mining available expression array data identified genes from these regions as candidates
  for involvement in TGCT development. Supplementary data is available at http: www.crukdmf.icr.ac.uk
