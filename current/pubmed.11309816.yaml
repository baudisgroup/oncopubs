abstract: 'To identify DNA amplifications in sarcomas, comparative genomic hybridization
  was performed on 27 cases that were likely to display high-level DNA copy number
  gains. In all cases, chromosome banding analysis had revealed homogeneously staining
  regions or double minutes, i.e., cytogenetic signs of gene amplification. In most
  cases, gains predominated over losses. Low-level amplifications ratio 1.3:1.5 were
  seen in 20 cases. High-level amplifications ratio amp gt 1.5 exceeded the frequencies
  seen in published, unselected sarcomas of similar histotypes and were detected in
  16 tumors: 4 4 osteosarcomas, 5 8 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 3 7 leiomyosarcomas,
  1 2 myosarcomas, 0 1 liposarcoma, 0 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 1 pleomorphic sarcoma,
  0 1 myxofibrosarcoma, 1 1 malignant mesenchymona, and 1 1 malignant schwannoma,
  with two to four chromosomal regions involved in nine tumors. Recurrent amplifications
  involved 1p33-p32, 5p15-p14, 7pter-p12, 7q21-qter, 8q21.3-qter, 11q22-q23, 16p13.2-p12,
  19q12-q13.1, 20q11.2-qter, and 22q12-q13. Most of the recurrent gains amplifications
  we detected have been reported in sarcomas previously. A novel gain amplification
  was seen at 2q14.3-q21 in five cases of four sarcoma types. The disparate pattern
  of amplified sequences, the poor correspondence between the localization of low-
  and high-level amplifications, and the chromosomal position of homogeneously staining
  regions suggest the involvement of many genes in the amplifications and that the
  genes rarely maintain their native position in these tumors.'
