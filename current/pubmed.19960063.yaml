abstract: Angiogenesis is involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL , and high microvascular density has been found in CLL to be associated
  with a poor prognosis. In this study, we assessed serum levels of adiponectin in
  69 patients with Binet stage A B-CLL, and these values were retrospectively correlated
  with bone marrow BM microvessel area and serum levels of vascular endothelial growth
  factor VEGF , fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 , angiogenin, PECAM-1 CD31 , matrix
  metalloproteinase-9 MMP-9 , interleukin-8 IL-8 , syndecan-1, and the percentage
  of CD38 or ZAP-70 CLL cells. The positive correlation between serum levels of adiponectin
  and VEGF P .03 does not translate into an increase of the extent of BM angiogenesis
  P .404 , FGF-2 P .348 , angiogenin P .402 , and CD31 P .248 serum concentrations.
  Accordingly, IL-8 P .175 , syndecan-1 P .06 , and MMP-9 P .144 circulating levels
  were not likely to reflect adiponectin concentration. Furthermore, patients with
  higher levels of adiponectin had a more favorable biological profile as defined
  by a lower number of both CD38 - r -0.294 P .02 and ZAP-70  r -0.285 P .04 . Finally,
  we evaluated the presence of adiponectin in B-CLL cells at gene expression level.
  RMA intensity values for adiponectin gene transcript denote a homogeneous low expression
  in B-CLL cells, whereas VEGF transcript was highly expressed with a degree of interpatient
  variability. Overall, these data seem to indicate that adiponectin could be involved
  as an antiangiogenic factor in B-CLL.
