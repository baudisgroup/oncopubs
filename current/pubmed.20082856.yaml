abstract: 'We report oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization findings in a case
  of malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. In addition to gains of 1q and 5p, and
  losses of 10p and 13q14 approximately q22, this tumor had also losses of two regions
  to which tumor suppressor genes are mapped: 1p36 SDHB and 17q11.2 NF1 . Both genes
  are associated with hereditary cancer syndromes, including gastrointestinal stromal
  tumors. Whether these two genes played a role in the development or progression
  of this phyllodes tumor of the breast with a sarcomatous stromal component warrants
  further investigation of similar cases.'
