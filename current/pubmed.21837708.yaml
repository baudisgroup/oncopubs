abstract: Although t 11 18 q21 q21 , t 1 14 p22 q32 , and a few other genetic mutations
  are specific markers for the Helicobacter pylori HP -independent status of gastric
  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma, the molecular mechanisms responsible
  for HP-independence of gastric MALT lymphoma without such translocations and mutations
  remain uncharacterized. In the present study, we describe the establishment and
  characterization of a novel MALT lymphoma cell line, MA-1, which was derived from
  a gastric MALT lymphoma which was negative for both t 11 18 q21 q21 and t 1 14 p22
  q32 the patient had failed HP eradication therapy and chemotherapy. The cell morphology
  and the immunophenotype of this cell line were similar to that of the original gastric
  MALT lymphoma. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed no significant
  gene copy number changes. Spectral karyotyping displayed a near-diploid chromosome
  content 48 amp lt 2n amp gt XY , with at least 13 chromosome structural abnormalities.
  Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses disclosed the existence
  of three sub-clones, characterized by t 14 18 q32 q21 IGH-BCL2, t 14 18 q32 q21
  IGH-MALT1, and the presence of both chromosomal translocations in the same cell,
  respectively whereas amplification of the genes CRAD9, TRAF2, and BCL10 were not
  found. In conclusion, we have established the first human gastric MALT lymphoma
  cell line, which is characterized by unusual and complex chromosome translocations
  and will be useful to explore further the molecular mechanisms of HP-independence
  in gastric MALT lymphoma.
