abstract: High-grade serous cancer HGSC is the most common cancer of the ovary and
  is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination
  repair HRR are associated with genomic instability in HGSC, and are exploited by
  therapy targeting DNA repair. Defective HRR causes uniparental deletions and loss
  of heterozygosity LOH . Our purpose is to profile LOH in HGSC and correlate our
  findings to clinical outcome, and compare HGSC and high-grade breast cancers.
