abstract: Multiple myeloma MM is characterized by marked genomic heterogeneity. Beyond
  structural rearrangements, a relevant role in its biology is represented by allelic
  imbalances leading to significant variations in ploidy status. To elucidate better
  the genomic complexity of MM, we analyzed a panel of 45 patients using combined
  FISH and microarray approaches. We firstly generated genome-wide profiles of 41
  MMs and four plasma cell leukemias, using a self-developed procedure to infer exact
  local copy numbers CNs for each sample. Our analysis allowed the identification
  of a significant fraction of patients showing near-tetraploidy. Furthermore, a conventional
  hierarchical clustering analysis showed that near-tetraploidy, 1q gain, hyperdiploidy,
  and recursive deletions at 1p and chromosomes 13, 14, and 22 were the main aberrations
  driving samples grouping. Moreover, mapping information was integrated with gene
  expression profiles of the tumor samples. A multiclass analysis of transcriptional
  profiles characterizing the different clusters showed marked gene-dosage effects,
  particularly concerning 1q transcripts this finding was also confirmed by a nonparametric
  analysis between normalized gene expression levels and local CN variations 1027
  highly-significant correlated genes . Finally, we identified several loci in which
  gene expression correlated with the occurrence of loss of heterozygosity. Our results
  provide insights into the composite network linking genome structure and transcriptional
  features in MM.
