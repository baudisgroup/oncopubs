abstract: Intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) may foster tumour adaptation and compromise
  the efficacy of personalized medicine approaches. The scale of heterogeneity within
  a tumour (intratumour heterogeneity) relative to genetic differences between tumours
  (intertumour heterogeneity) is unknown. To address this, we obtained 48 biopsies
  from eight stage III and IV clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) and used DNA
  copy-number analyses to compare biopsies from the same tumour with 440 single tumour
  biopsies from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
  of TCGA and multi-region ccRCC samples revealed segregation of samples from the
  same tumour into unrelated clusters; 25% of multi-region samples appeared more similar
  to unrelated samples than to any other sample originating from the same tumour.
  We found that the majority of recurrent DNA copy number driver aberrations in single
  biopsies were not present ubiquitously in late-stage ccRCCs and were likely to represent
  subclonal events acquired during tumour progression. Such heterogeneous subclonal
  genetic alterations within individual tumours may impair the identification of robust
  ccRCC molecular subtypes classified by distinct copy number alterations and clinical
  outcomes. The co-existence of distinct subclonal copy number events in different
  regions of individual tumours reflects the diversification of individual ccRCCs
  through multiple evolutionary routes and may contribute to tumour sampling bias
  and impact upon tumour progression and clinical outcome.
