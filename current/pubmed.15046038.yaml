abstract: Non-epithelial tumors only rarely affect the pancreas. In this report, we
  describe a malignant non-epithelial tumor with combined characteristics of malignant
  peripheral nerve sheath tumor MPNST and malignant melanoma. To more closely define
  the differential diagnosis of MPNST with focal pigmentation versus metastatic melanoma
  resembling MPNST, the tumor was investigated using histomorphology, immunohistochemistry,
  electron microscopy, and comparative genomic hybridization. As a result, from these
  analyses and from clinical findings, the diagnosis of a pancreatic MPNST with focal
  pigmentation was favored. However, the diagnosis of a malignant melanoma or a composite
  tumor could not be definitely ruled out, due to the considerable morphological and
  genotypical overlap between both entities, which can be explained by the close histogenetic
  relationship between both tumor entities.
