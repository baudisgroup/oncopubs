abstract: Rearrangements affecting the MLL gene in hematological malignancies are
  associated with poor prognosis. Most often they are reciprocal translocations and
  more rarely complex forms involving at least 3 chromosomes. We describe an unusual
  case with cutaneous leukemic infiltrates that waxed and waned until progression
  to acute myeloid leukemia, AML-M5. The leukemic cells harbored a novel apparent
  3-way translocation t(6;19;11)(p22.2;p13.1;q23.3). We utilized advanced molecular
  cytogenetic methods including 24-color karyotyping, high-resolution array comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) and DNA sequencing to characterize the genomic complement
  in the leukemic cells from aspirated bone marrow cells at AML diagnosis. Karyotyping
  showed 47,XY,t(6;19;11)(p22;p13;q23),+der(6)t(6;11)(p22;q23)[17]/48,sl,+8[3]/48,sl,+8,der(12)t(1;12)(q11;p13)[3]/
  48,sdl,der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q11),+8[7] conferring MLL-ELL fusion. Oligo-aCGH analysis
  confirmed gains of 6p22qter and 11q23.3qter involving the CMAHP and MLL genes, respectively.
  DNA sequencing disclosed an additional breakpoint at 6p24.3 (at RREB1 gene). Retrospective
  fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed presence of the MLL-involving rearrangement
  in the initial stages of disease before clear morphological signs of bone marrow
  involvement. The patient responded well to therapy and remains in remission>6 years
  from diagnosis. This apparent 3-way translocation is remarkable because of its rarity
  and presentation with myeloid sarcoma, and may, as more cases are characterized,
  further our understanding onto how such complex translocations contribute to promote
  leukemogenesis and respond to therapy.  Copyright ï¿½ 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.
