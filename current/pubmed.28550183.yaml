abstract: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant
  precursor of multiple myeloma with a 1% risk of progression per year. Although targeted
  analyses have shown the presence of specific genetic abnormalities such as IGH translocations,
  RB1 deletion, 1q gain, hyperdiploidy or RAS genes mutations, little is known about
  the molecular mechanism of malignant transformation. We have performed whole exome
  sequencing together with CGH+SNP array analysis in 33 flow-cytometry separated abnormal
  plasma cell samples from MGUS patients to describe somatic gene mutations and chromosome
  changes at the genome-wide level. Non-synonymous mutations and copy-number alterations
  were present in 97.0% and in 60.6% of cases, respectively. Importantly, the number
  of somatic mutations was significantly lower in MGUS compared to myeloma (P < 10-4)
  and we identified six genes that were significantly mutated in myeloma (KRAS, NRAS,
  DIS3, HIST1H1E, EGR1 and LTB) within the MGUS dataset. We also found a positive
  correlation with increasing chromosome changes and somatic gene mutations. IGH translocations
  were present in 27.3% of cases comprising t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16) or t(14;20)
  and were present in a similar frequency to myeloma, consistent with the primary
  lesion hypothesis. MYC translocations and TP53 deletions or mutations were not detected
  in MGUS samples indicating they may be drivers of progression to myeloma. Data from
  this study show that MGUS is genetically similar to myeloma, however overall genetic
  abnormalities are present at significantly lower levels compared to myeloma.
