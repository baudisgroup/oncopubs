abstract: Giant cell ependymoma, a rare ependymoma subtype, was recently recognized
  as a separate diagnostic entity with variations both in malignant potential and
  course of disease. We analyzed the first supratentorial giant cell ependymoma using
  G-band karyotyping, DNA ploidy analysis, and array comparative genomic hybridization.
  The tumor was hypodiploid, and the karyotype showed multiple monosomies. This novel
  cytogenetic pattern seems specific for giant cell ependymoma as the only previous
  cytogenetic analysis of a giant cell ependymoma found similar monosomies. We were
  also able to analyze cytogenetically the subsequent recurrent tumor, phenotypically
  an anaplastic ependymoma, allowing a first insight into the genetic events involved
  in disease progression.
