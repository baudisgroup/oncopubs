abstract: Early genetic events in the development of high-grade serous ovarian cancer
  HGSOC may define the molecular basis of the profound structural and numerical instability
  of chromosomes in this disease. To discover candidate genetic changes we sequentially
  passaged cells from a karyotypically normal hTERT immortalised human ovarian surface
  epithelial line IOSE25 resulting in the spontaneous formation of colonies in soft
  agar. Cell lines transformed ovarian surface epithelium 1 and 4 TOSE 1 and 4 established
  from these colonies had an abnormal karyotype and altered morphology, but were not
  tumourigenic in immunodeficient mice. TOSE cells showed loss of heterozygosity LOH
  at TP53, increased nuclear p53 immunoreactivity and altered expression profile of
  p53 target genes. The parental IOSE25 cells contained a missense, heterozygous R175H
  mutation in TP53, whereas TOSE cells had LOH at the TP53 locus with a new R273H
  mutation at the previous wild-type TP53 allele. Cytogenetic and array CGH analysis
  of TOSE cells also revealed a focal genomic amplification of CXCR4, a chemokine
  receptor commonly expressed by HGSOC cells. TOSE cells had increased functional
  CXCR4 protein and its abrogation reduced epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR expression,
  as well as colony size and number. The CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, was epigenetically
  silenced in TOSE cells and its forced expression increased TOSE colony size. TOSE
  cells had other cytogenetic changes typical of those seen in HGSOC ovarian cancer
  cell lines and biopsies. In addition, enrichment of CXCR4 pathway in expression
  profiles from HGSOC correlated with enrichment of a mutated TP53 gene expression
  signature and of EGFR pathway genes. Our data suggest that mutations in TP53 and
  amplification of the CXCR4 gene locus may be early events in the development of
  HGSOC, and associated with chromosomal instability.
