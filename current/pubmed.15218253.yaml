abstract: We have established that whole genome amplification WGA , in conjunction
  with genomic DNA array comparative genomic hybridisation gaCGH allows for the identification
  of genome-wide copy number abnormalities CNAs in DNA extracted from both cell line
  and patient material. To determine the fidelity and reproducibility of WGA to detect
  copy number imbalances using gaCGH, well characterized cell line genomic DNA was
  analysed. The gaCGH data obtained from non-amplified DNA and amplified DNA for the
  neuroblastoma cell line NUB7 and a paediatric medulloblastoma patient was almost
  identical. In addition, laser capture microdissection LCM of prostate tumour cells
  and subsequent WGA allowed for the detection of a number of CNAs that may not have
  been identified if DNA had been extracted in bulk from heterogeneous tissue. The
  results presented here demonstrate the use of WGA for generating sufficient DNA
  for gaCGH analysis without the introduction of significant sequence representation
  bias. The combination of amplification and gaCGH using DNA extracted from archival
  patient material has the potential for permitting the studying of DNA from small
  cancerous or pre-cancerous foci, which may help to identify potential genomic markers
  for early diagnosis.
