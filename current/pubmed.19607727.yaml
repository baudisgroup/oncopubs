notes: In the GEO series data, the log2 values are reversed (reference/probe), although
  a standard probe/reference value is indicated. This is fixed for the data presented
  through the array plotting option of our website. For the Progenetix database, some
  obvious segmentation problems (e.g. 9 cen deletions) were edited manually.
