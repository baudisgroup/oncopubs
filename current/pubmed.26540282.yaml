abstract: 'Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) characterized by the presence
  of dysplasia and DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs), may reflect chromosomal instability
  (CIN) and predispose to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Early detection of
  OPMDs with such characteristics may play a crucial role in OSCC prevention. The
  aim of this study was to explore the relationship between CNAs, histological diagnosis,
  oral subsite and aneuploidy in OPMDs/OSCCs. Samples from OPMDs and OSCCs were processed
  by high-resolution DNA flow cytometry (hr DNA-FCM) to determine the relative nuclear
  DNA content. Additionally, CNAs were obtained for a subset of these samples by genome-wide
  array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using DNA extracted from either diploid
  or aneuploid nuclei suspension sorted by FCM. Our study shows that: i) aneuploidy,
  global genomic imbalance (measured as the total number of CNAs) and specific focal
  CNAs occur early in the development of oral cancer and become more frequent at later
  stages; ii) OPMDs limited to tongue (TNG) mucosa display a higher frequency of aneuploidy
  compared to OPMDs confined to buccal mucosa (BM) as measured by DNA-FCM; iii) TNG
  OPMDs/OSCCs show peculiar features of CIN compared to BM OPMDs/OSCCs given the preferential
  association with total broad and specific focal CNA gains. Follow-up studies are
  warranted to establish whether the presence of DNA aneuploidy and specific focal
  or broad CNAs may predict cancer development in non-dysplastic OPMDs.'
