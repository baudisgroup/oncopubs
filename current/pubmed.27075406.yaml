abstract: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal hematopoietic diseases
  characterized by cytopenia, dysplasia and increased risk of development to acute
  myeloid leukemia (AML). Unfavorable cytogenetic changes such as complex karyotypes
  or chromosome 7 anomalies are predictive of the progression to AML and poor prognosis.
  Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is the result of a deficiency of arginine vasopressin,
  and its major causes are idiopathic, primary or secondary tumors, neurosurgery and
  trauma. Importantly, CDI is a rare complication of MDS. To date, only 5 cases of
  MDS co-occurring with CDI have been reported; 3 of 5 had cytogenetic abnormalities
  uncovered by metaphase cytogenetics and 3 of 5 evolved to AML. Here, we describe
  a 74-year-old woman who presented with CDI as her initial symptom of MDS and eventually
  progressed to AML. The metaphase cytogenetics, combined with the single-nucleotide
  polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping, with superiority in resolution and
  detecting copy number variation, revealed a complex karyotype that included monosomy
  of chromosome 7, deletion of 20q, and absence of heterogeneity (AOH) in more than
  one chromosome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of MDS
  co-occurring with CDI with numerous cytogenetic abnormalities revealed by the SNP-A-based
  karyotyping. Our case supports that the cytogenetic abnormalities may be associated
  with the clinical features and the prognosis of MDS co-occurring with CDI. The SNP-A-based
  karyotyping is helpful in revealing more subtle cytogenetic abnormalities and unveiling
  their roles in the pathogenesis of MDS.
