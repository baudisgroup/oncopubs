abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths
  worldwide. Recent high-throughput analyses of genomic alterations revealed several
  driver genes and altered pathways in GC. However, therapeutic applications from
  genomic data are limited, largely as a result of the lack of druggable molecular
  targets and preclinical models for drug selection. To identify new therapeutic targets
  for GC, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of DNA from
  103 patients with GC for copy number alteration (CNA) analysis, and whole-exome
  sequencing from 55 GCs from the same patients for mutation profiling. Pathway analysis
  showed recurrent alterations in the Wnt signaling [APC, CTNNB1, and DLC1 (deleted
  in liver cancer 1)], ErbB signaling (ERBB2, PIK3CA, and KRAS), and p53 signaling/apoptosis
  [TP53 and BCL2L1 (BCL2-like 1)] pathways. In 18.4% of GC cases (19/103), amplification
  of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2L1 was observed, and subsequently a BCL2L1 inhibitor
  was shown to markedly decrease cell viability in BCL2L1-amplified cell lines and
  in similarly altered patient-derived GC xenografts, especially when combined with
  other chemotherapeutic agents. In 10.9% of cases (6/55), mutations in DLC1 were
  found and were also shown to confer a growth advantage for these cells via activation
  of Rho-ROCK signaling, rendering these cells more susceptible to a ROCK inhibitor.
  Taken together, our study implicates BCL2L1 and DLC1 as potential druggable targets
  for specific subsets of GC cases.
