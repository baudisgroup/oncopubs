abstract: We examined the chromosomal changes of 22 hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis and compared the results with
  that of allelotype by polymerase chain reaction based loss of heterozygosity PCR-LOH
  analysis. By CGH analysis, frequent chromosomal losses were noted in the chromosomal
  region of 4q 59 , 8p 77 , and 16q 50 , whereas gains were noted in 1q 86 and 8q
  77 . All of these chromosomal arms were revealed to have frequent allelic imbalances
  by PCR-LOH analysis, however, 9 of chromosomal aberrations were detected only by
  CGH analysis and 2 were detected only by PCR-LOH analysis. Our results suggest that
  CGH analysis gives more precise results for the screening of chromosomal aberrations
  in HCCs than that of PCR-LOH analysis with randomly selected microsatellite markers.
