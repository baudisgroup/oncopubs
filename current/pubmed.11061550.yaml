abstract: Carney complex CNC is a familial multiple neoplasia and lentiginosis syndrome
  with features overlapping those of McCune-Albright syndrome MAS and other multiple
  endocrine neoplasia MEN syndromes, MEN type 1 MEN 1 , in particular. GH-producing
  pituitary tumors have been described in individual reports and in at least two large
  CNC patient series. It has been suggested that the evolution of acromegaly in CNC
  resembles that of the other endocrine manifestations of CNC in its chronic, often
  indolent, progressive nature. However, histologic and molecular evidence has not
  been presented in support of this hypothesis. In this investigation, the pituitary
  glands of eight patients with CNC and acromegaly age, 22.9 -11.6 yr mean - SD were
  studied histologically. Tumor DNA was used for comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH four tumors . All tumors stained for both GH and prolactin PRL eight of eight
  , and some for other hormones, including alpha-subunit. Evidence for somatomammotroph
  hyperplasia was present in five of the eight patients in proximity to adenoma tissue
  in the remaining three only adenoma tissue was available for study. CGH showed multiple
  changes involving losses of chromosomal regions 6q, 7q, 11p, and 11q, and gains
  of 1pter-p32, 2q35-qter, 9q33-qter, 12q24-qter, 16, 17, 19p, 20p, 20q, 22p and 22q
  in the most aggressive tumor, an invasive macroadenoma no chromosomal changes were
  seen in the microadenomas diagnosed prospectively 3 tumors . We conclude that, in
  at least some patients with CNC, the pituitary gland is characterized by somatotroph
  hyperplasia, which precedes GH-producing tumor formation, in a pathway similar to
  that suggested for MAS-related pituitary tumors. Three GH-producing microadenomas
  showed no genetic changes by CGH, whereas a macroadenoma in a patient, whose advanced
  acromegaly was not cured by surgery, showed extensive CGH changes. We speculate
  that these changes represent secondary and tertiary genetic amp quot hits amp quot
  involved in pituitary oncogenesis. The data 1 underline the need for early investigation
  for acromegaly in patients with CNC 2 provide a molecular hypothesis for its clinical
  progression and 3 suggest a model for MAS- and, perhaps, MEN 1-related GH-producing
  tumor formation.
