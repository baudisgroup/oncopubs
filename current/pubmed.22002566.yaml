abstract: Amplification of chromosomal region 11q13, containing the cell cycle regulatory
  gene CCND1, is frequently found in breast cancer and other malignancies. It is associated
  with the favourable oestrogen receptor ER -positive breast tumour phenotype, but
  also with poor prognosis and treatment failure. 11q13 spans almost 14 Mb and contains
  more than 200 genes and is affected by various patterns of copy number gains, suggesting
  complex mechanisms and selective pressure during tumour progression. In this study,
  we used 32 k tiling BAC array CGH to analyse 94 CCND1-amplified breast tumours from
  sporadic, hereditary, and familial breast cancers to fine map chromosome 11q13.
  A set containing 281 CCND1-non-amplified breast tumours was used for comparisons.
  We used gene expression data to further validate the functional effect of gene amplification.
  We identified six core regions covering 11q13.1-q14.1 that were amplified in different
  combinations. The major core contained CCND1, whereas two cores were found proximal
  of CCND1 and three distal. The majority of the CCND1-amplified tumours were ER-positive
  and classified as luminal B. Furthermore, we found that CCND1 amplification is associated
  with a more aggressive phenotype within histological grade 2 tumours and luminal
  A subtype tumours. Amplification was equally prevalent in familial and sporadic
  tumours, but strikingly rare in BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated tumours. We conclude that
  11q13 includes many potential target genes in addition to CCND1.
