abstract: B-cell lymphomas leukemias with simultaneous t 14 18 q32 q21 and MYC rearrangements
  have recently been shown to constitute a separate diagnostic entity, presenting
  with a rapid clinical course and a very poor prognosis. We describe the establishment
  of an Epstein-Barr virus negative cell line, designated U-2973, from a male patient
  with a de novo aggressive B-cell lymphoma leukemia and very high peripheral blast
  cell count. Flow cytometry of bone marrow cells and U-2973 displayed a mature B-cell
  phenotype, and immunostaining showed expression of MYC and BCL2. IG gene rearrangement
  data were consistent with a lymphoid neoplasm of germinal centre derivation. Cytogenetic
  studies using conventional G-banding, fluorescent in situ hybridization, spectral
  karyotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism array demonstrated a complex karyotype
  with both a t 14 18 and double translocations between MYC and a non-IG gene partner
  located at chromosome 12p12.1.
