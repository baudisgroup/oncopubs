abstract: We demonstrate that, in human bladder cancer, amplification of the E2F3
  gene, located at 6p22, is associated with overexpression of its encoded mRNA transcripts
  and high levels of expression of E2F3 protein. Immunohistochemical analyses of E2F3
  protein levels have established that around one-third 33 101 of primary transitional
  cell carcinomas of the bladder overexpress nuclear E2F3 protein, with the proportion
  of tumours containing overexpressed nuclear E2F3 increasing with tumour stage and
  grade. When considered together with the established role of E2F3 in cell cycle
  progression, these results suggest that the E2F3 gene represents a candidate bladder
  cancer oncogene that is activated by DNA amplification and overexpression.
