abstract: Gains or amplifications involving chromosome arm 8q are one of the most
  recurrent chromosomal alterations in head and neck tumors. To characterize previously
  reported gains, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH using the sequences
  BAC RP1179E1 and 8-centromere PMJ 128 as probes. Gains and or amplifications were
  detected in all 19 cases evaluated by FISH. The FISH analysis, but not G-banding,
  revealed homogeneously staining region in three cases. We conclude that gains of
  one or more genes on chromosome arm 8q may be important for the early stages of
  head and neck carcinomas.
