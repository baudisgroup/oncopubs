abstract: A new t 20 21 q11 q11 , associated with a deletion on the long arm of chromosome
  20, was found in one patient with an acute myelocytic leukemia AML and in one with
  myelodysplastic syndrome MDS . In both cases deletion was interstitial, extending
  from band q11 to band q13, as shown by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and
  fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . FISH analysis with whole arm paints, subtelomeric
  probes, and locus-specific probes for the long arms of chromosomes 20 and 21 revealed
  in patient 1 a reciprocal translocation between the deleted 20q and the long arm
  of chromosome 21, that is, del 20 q11q13 t 20 21 q11 q11 , and in patient 2, material
  from 21q was inserted into the deleted 20q, that is, del 20 q11q13 ins 20 21 q11
  q11q22 . This is the first identification of a complex 20 21 rearrangement in MDS
  AML. Deletion at 20q and juxtaposition between 20q11 and 21q11 appear to be the
  critical genomic events.
