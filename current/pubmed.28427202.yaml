abstract: 'Breast cancer (BC) has been genetically profiled through large-scale genome
  analyses. However, the role and clinical implications of genetic alterations in
  metastatic BC (MBC) have not been evaluated. Therefore, we conducted whole-exome
  sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq of 37 MBC samples and targeted deep sequencing of another
  29 MBCs. We evaluated somatic mutations from WES and targeted sequencing and assessed
  gene expression and performed pathway analysis from RNA-Seq. In this analysis, PIK3CA
  was the most commonly mutated gene in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC, while
  in ER-negative BC, TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene (p = 0.018 and p < 0.001,
  respectively). TP53 stopgain/loss and frameshift mutation was related to low expression
  of TP53 in contrast nonsynonymous mutation was related to high expression. The impact
  of TP53 mutation on clinical outcome varied with regard to ER status. In ER-positive
  BCs, wild type TP53 had a better prognosis than mutated TP53 (median overall survival
  (OS) (wild type vs. mutated): 88.5 ï¿½ 54.4 vs. 32.6 ï¿½ 10.7 (months), p = 0.002).
  In contrast, mutated TP53 had a protective effect in ER-negative BCs (median OS:
  0.10 vs. 32.6 ï¿½ 8.2, p = 0.026). However, PIK3CA mutation did not affect patient
  survival. In gene expression analysis, CALM1, a potential regulator of AKT, was
  highly expressed in PIK3CA-mutated BCs. In conclusion, mutation of TP53 was associated
  with expression status and affect clinical outcome according to ER status in MBC.
  Although mutation of PIK3CA was not related to survival in this study, mutation
  of PIK3CA altered the expression of other genes and pathways including CALM1 and
  may be a potential predictive marker of PI3K inhibitor effectiveness.'
