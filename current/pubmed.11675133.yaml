abstract: To identify amplified oncogenes involved in hepatocellular carcinomas HCC
  , we applied a genomic DNA microarray spotted with 57 oncogenes to 20 HCCs. Aberrations
  in DNA copy number also were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH using
  an aliquot of DNA samples. In 5 of 20 HCCs, only 6 oncogenes CCND1, FGF3 FGF4, SAS
  CDK4, TERC, MET, and MYC were amplified, whereas in the remaining 15 tumors no oncogenes
  were amplified. A comparison of DNA microarray and conventional CGH analyses showed
  that, although 5 of 6 amplified oncogenes shown by microarray were located in chromosomal
  regions shown by CGH to have increased DNA copy numbers, not all genes located in
  such chromosomal regions were affected. One of the amplified oncogenes SAS CDK4
  was found in a chromosomal region that was undetected by CGH. We, therefore, conclude
  that amplification of the oncogenes examined in this series is not directly implicated
  in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
