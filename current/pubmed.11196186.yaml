abstract: Bladder cancer is often characterized by a multifocal growth pattern. This
  observation has given rise to the hypothesis of amp quot field cancerization, amp
  quot predicting a polyclonal origin of multiple tumors rising from an area of independently
  transformed mucosa cells. On the other hand, genetic studies suggested a monoclonal
  origin. To address these contradictory hypotheses, we performed comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH on 32 tumors originating from six bladder cystectomy specimens.
  All tumors derived from the same patient showed a set of 7-13 identical chromosomal
  aberrations and additional individual alterations. Most striking were the findings
  of 17p losses in all 32 of 32 tumors of the six cystectomy specimens and 20p gains
  in all tumors of four bladders, as well as an unexpected high number of chromosomal
  changes 20.4 alterations per tumor on average . To clarify a possible role of the
  TP53 tumor suppressor gene on 17p13, we applied immunohistochemistry and sequence
  analysis on the tumors and additional 52 mucosa samples. Identical TP53 mutations
  and protein overexpression was found in individual tumors only as well as in mucosa
  samples from continuous areas. Our results not only provide further evidence for
  a monoclonal origin of multifocal bladder cancer but also point at intraepithelial
  migration of tumor cells carrying specific chromosomal aberrations.
