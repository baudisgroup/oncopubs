abstract: 'Recent studies have subdivided serous borderline tumors into 2 categories:
  atypical proliferative serous tumors APSTs , which have a relatively benign course,
  and micropapillary serous carcinomas MPSCs , which behave like low-grade carcinoma.
  This study was undertaken to determine, using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , whether cytogenetic changes support this hypothesis. Nine cases of APST, 10
  of MPSC, and 11 of invasive serous carcinoma SC were analyzed by CGH. Tumor DNA
  was extracted from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary ovarian tumor,
  using either sections with at least 70 tumor cells or tissue after relative enrichment
  by microdissection. Chromosomal imbalances were identified in 3 of 9 APST, 6 of
  10 MPSC, and 11 of 11 SC. Three or more chromosomal imbalances were found in 0 of
  9 APST, 4 of 10 MPSC, and 9 of 11 SC. Recurrent copy number alterations were grouped
  into 4 classes correlating with the different tumor types. Class I changes were
  present in APST and in MPSC or SC and included 8q 7 of 11 SC, 2 of 10 MPSC, 2 of
  9 APST , -9p 5 of 11 SC, 0 of 10 MPSC, 1 of 9 APST , and 12 12p in 3 11 SC, 12 in
  2 of 10 MPSC, 12 in 1 of 9 APST . Class II changes were found only in MPSC and SC,
  but not in APST. The most frequent examples were 3q 10 of 11 SC, 1 of 10 MPSC ,
  -4q 5 of 11 SC, 1 of 10 MPSC , and -17p 5 of 11 SC, 1 of 10 MPSC . Class III changes
  were limited to SC, like -16q 7 of 11 SC and -18q 6 of 11 SC . Class VI changes
  were unique to MPSC. Gain of 16p 3 of 10 MPSC was the only aberration in this group.
  This aberration was not only unique to MPSC but was also the most frequent finding
  in MPSC. These data support the hypothesis that noninvasive serous tumors of the
  ovary can be subdivided into 2 categories: APST and MPSC. The number of imbalances
  in MPSC is substantially higher than in APST and lower than in SC. Some changes
  in MPSC are shared with SC and APST and others with SC only, suggesting that a subset
  of MPSC may represent a stage in progression from APST to SC. Other cases of MPSC
  with independent genetic alterations may represent another subset of tumors that
  are a distinct entity from APST and SC.'
