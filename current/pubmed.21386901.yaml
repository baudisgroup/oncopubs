abstract: Identifying oral cancer lesions associated with high risk of relapse and
  predicting clinical outcome remain challenging questions in clinical practice. Genomic
  alterations may add prognostic information and indicate biological aggressiveness
  thereby emphasizing the need for genome-wide profiling of oral cancers. High-resolution
  array comparative genomic hybridization was performed to delineate the genomic alterations
  in clinically annotated primary gingivo-buccal complex and tongue cancers n  60
  . The specific genomic alterations so identified were evaluated for their potential
  clinical relevance. Copy-number changes were observed on chromosomal arms with most
  frequent gains on 3q 60 , 5p 50 , 7p 50 , 8q 73 , 11q13 47 , 14q11.2 47 , and 19p13.3
  58 and losses on 3p14.2 55 and 8p 83 . Univariate statistical analysis with correction
  for multiple testing revealed chromosomal gain of region 11q22.1-q22.2 and losses
  of 17p13.3 and 11q23-q25 to be associated with loco-regional recurrence P  0.004,
  P  0.003, and P  0.0003 and shorter survival P  0.009, P  0.003, and P 0.0001 respectively.
  The gain of 11q22 and loss of 11q23-q25 were validated by interphase fluorescent
  in situ hybridization I-FISH . This study identifies a tractable number of genomic
  alterations with few underlying genes that may potentially be utilized as biological
  markers for prognosis and treatment decisions in oral cancers.
