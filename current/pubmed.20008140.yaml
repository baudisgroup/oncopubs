abstract: Angiosarcomas AS are rare vascular malignancies that arise either de novo
  as primary tumors or secondary to irradiation or chronic lymphedema. The cytogenetics
  of angiosarcomas are poorly characterized. We applied array-comparative genomic
  hybridization as a screening method to identify recurrent alterations in 22 cases.
  Recurrent genetic alterations were identified only in secondary but not in primary
  AS. The most frequent recurrent alterations were high level amplifications on chromosome
  8q24.21 50 , followed by 10p12.33 33 and 5q35.3 11 . Fluorescence in situ hybridization
  analysis in 28 primary and 33 secondary angiosarcomas 31 tumors secondary to irradiation,
  2 tumors secondary to chronic lymphedema confirmed high level amplification of MYC
  on chromosome 8q24.21 as a recurrent genetic alteration found exclusively in 55
  of AS secondary to irradiation or chronic lymphedema, but not in primary AS. Amplification
  of MYC did not predispose to high grade morphology or increased cell turnover. In
  conclusion, despite their identical morphology, secondary AS are genetically different
  from primary AS and are characterized by a high frequency of high level amplifications
  of MYC. This finding may have implications both for the diagnosis and treatment
  of these tumors.
