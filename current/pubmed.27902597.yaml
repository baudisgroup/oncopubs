abstract: The presence of multiple primary tumors (MPT) in a single patient has been
  identified with an increasing frequency. A critical issue is to establish if the
  second tumor represents an independent primary cancer or a metastasis. Therefore,
  the assessment of MPT clonal origin might help understand the disease behavior and
  improve the management/prognosis of the patient.Herein, we report a 73-year-old
  male smoker who developed 2 primary lung cancers (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
  carcinoma) and a malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (PM).Whole exome sequencing (WES)
  of the 3 tumors and of germline DNA was performed to determine the clonal origin
  and identify genetic cancer susceptibility.Both lung cancers were characterized
  by a high mutational rate with distinct mutational profiles and activation of tumor-specific
  pathways. Conversely, the PM harbored a relative low number of genetic variants
  and a novel mutation in the WT1 gene that might be involved in the carcinogenesis
  of nonasbestos-related mesothelioma. Finally, WES of the germinal DNA displayed
  several single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes likely conferring higher
  cancer susceptibility.Overall, WES did not disclose any somatic genetic variant
  shared across the 3 tumors, suggesting their clonal independency; however, the carcinogenic
  effect of smoke combined with a deficiency in DNA repair genes and the patient advanced
  age might have been responsible for the MPT development. This case highlights the
  WES importance to define the clonal origin of MPT and susceptibility to cancer.
