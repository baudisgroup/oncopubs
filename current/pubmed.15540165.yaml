abstract: Little is known about the genomic alterations underlying osteosarcoma. We
  performed a genomewide high-resolution gene copy number analysis of 22 osteosarcoma
  samples using comparative genomic hybridization on a cDNA microarray that contained
  cDNA clones of about 13,000 genes. Nineteen of the 22 cases had amplifications that
  on average spanned more than 1 Mb and contained more than 10 genes. Numerous regions
  of gain and loss were identified, and their boundaries were defined at high resolution.
  Novel amplicons were found at 14q11, 17q25, and 22q11-q13. Earlier-known large amplified
  regions were detected at 12q11-q15, 8q24, 6p12-p13, and 17p11-p13 in 8, 6, 5, and
  4 of the 22 samples, respectively. Amplification of 12q was observed more frequently
  36 of the cases than previously reported. Previously known small amplicons at 1p34-p36,
  1q21, 19q13, and 21q22 were seen in at least three cases. Our results implicate
  TOM1L2 and CYP27B1 as having roles as novel targets for the 17p and 12q amplicons,
  respectively. Details www.helsinki.fi cmg of the amplified genes in each amplicon
  provide valuable raw data for further in silico studies.
