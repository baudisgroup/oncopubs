abstract: The accurate and high resolution mapping of DNA copy number aberrations
  has become an important tool by which to gain insight into the mechanisms of tumourigenesis.
  There are various commercially available platforms for such studies, but there remains
  no general consensus as to the optimal platform. There have been several previous
  platform comparison studies, but they have either described older technologies,
  used less-complex samples, or have not addressed the issue of the inherent biases
  in such comparisons. Here we describe a systematic comparison of data from four
  leading microarray technologies the Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP 5.0 array, Agilent
  High-Density CGH Human 244A array, Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip,
  and the Nimblegen 385 K oligonucleotide array . We compare samples derived from
  primary breast tumours and their corresponding matched normals, well-established
  cancer cell lines, and HapMap individuals. By careful consideration and avoidance
  of potential sources of bias, we aim to provide a fair assessment of platform performance.
