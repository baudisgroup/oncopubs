abstract: Extranodal natural killer-/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT) is a
  highly aggressive lymphoma and prognosis is usually poor. The genetic background
  of primary cutaneous cases is poorly understood.  We sought to evaluate the clinicopathologic
  features of cutaneous ENKTCL-NT, and the prognostic significance of genomic copy
  number alterations.  Eight cases of cutaneous ENKTCL-NT (5 primary, 2 secondary,
  1 no staging performed), including 2 patients with an unusually prolonged course
  of 5 and 23 years, were investigated using array comparative genomic hybridization.  All
  patients presented with typical clinicopathologic features. Epstein-Barr virus was
  found in neoplastic cells in all specimens. Copy number alterations were detected
  in all 8 cases with losses on 6qï¿½(37.5%ï¿½ofï¿½cases) and 7p (37.5% of cases),
  and gains on 7q (37.5% of cases) being the most frequent. Complexity of array comparative
  genomic hybridization profile did not correlate with the course of the disease.
  However, an increase of copy number alterations was detected in sequential biopsy
  specimens of 1ï¿½long-term survivor.  This was a small case series retrospective
  study.  Clinicopathologic features of cutaneous ENKTCL-NT are distinctive. Lower
  number ofï¿½copyï¿½number alterations cannot be used as predictor for prolonged
  survival in cutaneous ENKTCL-NT.  Copyright ï¿½ 2013 American Academy of Dermatology,
