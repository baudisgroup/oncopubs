abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC of the salivary gland is a neoplasm characterized
  by slow but inevitable local progression and terminal hematogenous metastasis. To
  detect novel imbalanced chromosomal regions associated with tumorigenesis, we used
  chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization to screen 27 ACC. The most common
  aberration was copy number gain of 22q13 nine cases followed by gains of 16p seven
  cases and 17q four cases and copy number losses on 6q six cases . To further delineate
  the prevalence of 22q13 copy number gains in ACC, fluorescence in situ hybridization
  was performed for five bacterial phage artificial chromosome BAC PAC probes from
  the 22q13 consensus region with 57 ACC on a tissue microarray. The overall prevalence
  of copy number gains on 22q13 was 30 of the tumors in the fluorescence in situ hybridization
  analysis, irrespective of histologic differentiation cribriform tubular vs. solid
  or tumor event primary vs. recurrent . We therefore assume that copy number gain
  of 22q13 is a novel frequent finding in ACC that may be involved in the initial
  pathogenesis of this neoplasm by proto-oncogene activation.
