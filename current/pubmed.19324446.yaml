abstract: About 50 of patients presenting with resectable lung cancer develop distant
  metastases within 5 years. Genomic markers predicting metastatic behaviour of squamous
  cell lung carcinoma SCC are currently underexposed. We analyzed a cohort of patients
  with primary SCC using array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to identify
  which genomic aberrations are related to metastatic behaviour. The cohort consisted
  of 34 patients with a follow-up of at least 5 years, 8 with metastases in regional
  lymph nodes only and 26 patients without any metastases at the time of surgery.
  Eleven of the latter 26 developed metastases in distant organs within 3 years after
  surgery. Copy number changes observed in at least 40 of all SCC included gains at
  chromosomal arms 3q, 5p, 8q, 19q, 20p, 22q and losses at 3p, 4p, 4q, 5q, 8p and
  9p. High copy number amplifications were observed at 2p15-p16, 3q24-q29, 8p11-p12,
  8q23-q24, and 12p12, containing candidate oncogenes such as BCL11A, REL, ECT2, PIK3CA,
  ADAM9, MYC and KRAS. Amplification of 2p15-p16 is a novel finding in SCC. Another
  novel finding is the homozygous deletion observed at 4q33-34.1 in 15 of the SCC
  cases. Gains at 7q36, 8p12, 10q22, 12p12, loss at 4p14 and the homozygous deletions
  at 4q occurred significantly more frequent in SCC from patients with lymph node
  metastases only. SCC from patients with distant metastases showed a significantly
  higher gain frequency at 8q22-q24 and loss at 8p23 and 13q21, and a significantly
  lower gain frequency at 2p12 and 2p16 and loss at 11q25 compared with SCC from patients
  without metastases. Of these, gains at 7q, 8p and 10q were restricted to SCC with
  lymph node metastasis and gain at 8q was restricted to patients with distant metastasis.
  Two genomic aberrations, i.e. loss of 4p and gain of 19q12 were observed more frequently
  in SCC with only lymph node metastases as compared to SCC with distant metastases.
  In conclusion, we identified genomic aberrations in primary SCC that were related
  to lymph node or distant metastases.
