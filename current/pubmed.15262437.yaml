abstract: Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in 48 Korean nonsmall cell carcinomas
  of the lung NSCLC , by degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction
  comparative genomic hybridization. These included 16 adenocarcinomas, 27 squamous
  cell carcinomas SCCs , and 5 large-cell carcinomas. The common sites of copy number
  increases were 3q26 approximately qter 23 cases, 48 8q23 approximately qter 46 20q13.1
  42 1q42 approximately qter 38 3q25 38 21q22 38 and 22q13 38 . DNA amplification
  was identified in 19 carcinomas 40 , and the frequent sites of amplification were
  8q24 seven cases , 3q26 seven cases , and 3q27 seven cases . The frequently under-represented
  chromosomal regions were Yq 38 , 4q25 approximately q26 23 , and 4q31 23 . In particular,
  gains of 3q26 approximately qter 74 , 15q 56 , and 19q 59 and loss of 13q22 approximately
  q31 26 were more frequently detected in SCCs of the lung. These nonrandom aberrations
  can serve as starting points for the identification of potential oncogenes tumor
  suppressor genes related to the tumorigenesis of Korean NSCLC.
