abstract: Patients with ulcerative colitis UC are prone to develop colorectal cancer
  which is related to the duration and extent of the disease. One of the earliest
  events in tumor progression is the development of aneuploidy. Aneuploidy is correlated
  with the grade of dysplasia which serves as a common but not always reproducible
  marker for the prediction of UC associated formation of cancer. We analyzed 48 biopsy
  samples from 5 patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . The majority of these samples represented premalignant stages
  which are not well characterized at the molecular level as yet. We compared biopsy
  samples from different colon locations in regard to chromosomal alterations, dysplasia
  status and DNA index. Besides chromosomal changes occurring only in certain patients
  in restricted areas of the colon we also detected amplifications and deletions which
  were common in all persons throughout the colon. The stage of dysplasia seems to
  have no influence on the number and appearance of chromosomal changes. Amplifications
  in 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 15 were found in almost all cases. In dysplastic samples
  chromosomal regions 3, 6 and 11 revealed gains of DNA. Deletions were detected within
  8q, 15, 18q, 20p and 22q. The affected chromosomal regions may contain yet unknown
  oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes participating in UC associated carcinogenesis.
  The conspicuous regions found in the CGH experiments allow the selective and detailed
  characterization at a molecular level.
