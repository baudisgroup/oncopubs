abstract: 'Renal cell carcinoma is characterized by an accumulation of complex chromosomal
  alterations during tumor progression. Chromosome 3p deletions are known to occur
  early in the carcinogenesis, but the nature of subsequent events, their interrelationships,
  and their sequence is poorly understood, as one usually only obtains a single amp
  quot view amp quot of the dynamic process of tumor development in a particular cancer
  patient. To address this limitation, we used comparative genomic hybridization analysis
  in combination with a distance-based and a branching-tree method to search for tree
  models of the oncogenesis process of 116 conventional clear cell renal carcinomas.
  This provides a means to analyze and model cancer development processes based on
  a more dynamic model, including the presence of multiple pathways, as compared with
  the fixed linear model first proposed by Vogelstein et al. N. Engl. J. Med., 319:
  525-532, 1988 for colorectal cancer. The most common DNA losses involved 3p 61 ,
  4q 50 , 6q 40 , 9p 35 , 13q 37 , and Xq 21 . The most common gains were seen at
  chromosome 17p and 17q 20 . The tree model derived from the distance-based method
  is consistent with the established theory that -3p is an important early event in
  conventional clear cell renal cancer and supports the prediction made from the branching
  tree that -4q is another important early event. Both tree models suggest that there
  may be two groups of clear cell renal cancers: one characterized by -6q, 17q, and
  17p, and another by -9p, -13q, and -18q. Putative prognostic parameters were -9p
  and -13q. The distance-based tree clarifies that -8p present in 12 of tumors is
  a late event, largely independent of other events. In summary, tree modeling of
  comparative genomic hybridization data provided new information on the interrelationships
  of genetic changes in renal cancer and their possible order, as well as a clustering
  of these events. Using tree analysis, one can derive a more in-depth understanding
  of the renal cancer development process than is possible by simply focusing on the
  frequencies of genetic events in a given cancer type.'
