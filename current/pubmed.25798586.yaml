abstract: Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare and sometimes lethal malignancy that presents
  a clinical challenge for both diagnosis and management. Recent studies have led
  to a better understanding of the molecular biology of peritoneal mesothelioma. Translation
  of the emerging data into better treatments and outcome is needed. From two patients
  with peritoneal mesothelioma, we derived whole genome sequences, RNA expression
  profiles, and targeted deep sequencing data. Molecular data were made available
  for translation into a clinical treatment plan. Treatment responses and outcomes
  were later examined in the context of molecular findings. Molecular studies presented
  here provide the first reported whole genome sequences of peritoneal mesothelioma.
  Mutations in known mesothelioma-related genes NF2, CDKN2A, LATS2, amongst others,
  were identified. Activation of MET-related signaling pathways was demonstrated in
  both cases. A hypermutated phenotype was observed in one case (434 vs. 18 single
  nucleotide variants) and was associated with a favourable outcome despite sarcomatoid
  histology and multifocal disease. This study represents the first report of whole
  genome analyses of peritoneal mesothelioma, a key step in the understanding and
  treatment of this disease.
