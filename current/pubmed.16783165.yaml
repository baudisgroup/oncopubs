abstract: 'Medulloblastomas and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors are
  aggressive childhood tumors. We report our findings using array comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH on a whole-genome BAC PAC cosmid array with a median clone separation
  of 0.97 Mb to study 34 medulloblastomas and 7 supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal
  tumors. Array CGH allowed identification and mapping of numerous novel, small regions
  of copy number change to genomic sequence in addition to the large regions already
  known from previous studies. Novel amplifications were identified, some encompassing
  oncogenes MYCL1, PDGFRA, KIT, and MYB not previously reported to show amplification
  in these tumors. In addition, one supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor
  had lost both copies of the tumor-suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Ten medulloblastomas
  had findings suggestive of isochromosome 17q. In contrast to previous reports using
  conventional CGH, array CGH identified 3 distinct breakpoints in these cases: Ch
  17: 17940393-19251679 17p11.2, n 6 , Ch 17: 20111990-23308272 17p11.2-17q11.2, n
  4 , and Ch 17: 38425359-39091575 17q21.31, n 1 . Significant differences were found
  in the patterns of copy number change between medulloblastomas and supratentorial
  primitive neuroectodermal tumors, providing further evidence that these tumors are
  genetically distinct despite their morphologic and behavioral similarities.'
