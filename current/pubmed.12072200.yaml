abstract: Molecular cytogenetics is helpful to identify complex and cryptic genomic
  changes in malignancy. Human leukemic cell lines are an important tool for advancements
  of biological research on malignant cells, one critical step being characterization
  of genomic changes. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization and comparative genomic
  hybridization to refine karyotypic interpretation of the diffuse histiocytic lymphoma
  derived U937-1 cell line. From this integrated approach, chromosome material involved
  in nine karyotypic markers and in unbalanced translocations could be identified.
  Moreover, a previously undetected amplicon emerged within band 6p21. The U937-I
  is a new in vitro model to study genome amplification and unknown recombinations
  in leukemic cells, such as those involving the centromeric region of chromosome
  1.
