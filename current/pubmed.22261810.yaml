abstract: 'PURPOSE: To carry out an integrative profile of human pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma PDAC to identify prognosis-significant genes and their related pathways.
  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A concordant survival-based whole genome in silico array analysis
  of DNA copy number, and mRNA and miRNA expression in 25 early-stage PDAC was carried
  out. A novel composite score simultaneously integrated gene expression with regulatory
  mechanisms to identify the signature genes with the most levels of prognosis-significant
  evidence. The predominant signaling pathways were determined via a pathway-based
  approach. Independent patient cohorts n 148 and 42 were then used as in vitro validation
  of the array findings. RESULTS: The composite score identified 171 genes in which
  expressions were able to define two prognosis subgroups P 3.8e-5 . Eighty-eight
  percent 151 of 171 of the genes were regulated by prognosis-significant miRNAs.
  The phosphoinositide 3-kinase AKT pathway and SRC signaling were densely populated
  by prognosis-significant genes and driven by genomic amplification of SRC and miRNA
  regulation of p85alpha and CBL. On tissue microarray validation n 148 , p85alpha
  protein expression was associated with improved survival for all patients P 0.02
  , and activated P-SRC Y418 was associated shorter survival for patients with low-grade
  histology tumors P 0.04 . Interacting P-SRC and p85alpha revealed that they define
  two distinct PDAC patient subgroups P 0.0066 . Furthering the importance of these
  pathways, CBL protein expression was associated with improved survival P 0.03 on
  a separate cohort n 42 . CONCLUSIONS: These pathways and related genes may represent
  putative clinical biomarkers and possible targets of individualized therapy in the
  distinct patient subgroups they define.'
