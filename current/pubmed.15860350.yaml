abstract: Here we report the complex pattern of genomic imbalances and rearrangements
  in a panel of 19 renal cell carcinoma cell lines detected with molecular cytogenetic
  analysis. Consistent heterogeneity in chromosome number was found, and most cell
  lines showed a near-triploid chromosome complement. Several cell lines showed deletions
  of the TP53 alias p53 , CDKN2A alias p16 , and VHL genes. Multiplex fluorescence
  in situ hybridization M-FISH analysis revealed chromosome 3 translocated to several
  other partners chromosomes, as well as breakage events commonly affecting chromosomes
  1, 5, 8, 10, and 17. The most common abnormality detected with comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH was deletions of chromosome 3p, with loss of the RASSF1, FHIT,
  and p44S10 loci frequently involved. CGH gain of 5q showed overrepresentation of
  the EGR1 and CSF1R genes. Recurrent alterations to chromosome 7 included rearrangement
  of 7q11 and gains of the EGFR, TIF1, and RFC2 genes. Several lines exhibited rearrangement
  of 12q11 approximately q14 and overrepresentation of CDK4 and SAS loci. M-FISH revealed
  several other recurrent translocations, and CGH findings included loss of 9p, 14q,
  and 18q and gain of 8q, 12, and 20. Further genomic microarray changes included
  loss of MTAP, IGH , HTR1B, and SMAD4 previously MADH4 and gains of MYC and TOP1.
  An excellent correlation was observed between the genomic array and FISH data, demonstrating
  that this technique is effective and accurate. The aberrations detected here may
  reflect important pathways in renal cancer pathogenesis.
