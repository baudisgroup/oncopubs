abstract: The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma OAC has been increasing rapidly
  with a dismal survival rate of less than 20 . Understanding the genomic aberrations
  and biology of this cancer may enhance disease interventions. This study aimed to
  use genome-wide genomic and expression data to enhance the understanding of OAC
  pathogenesis and identify groups with differential outcomes.
