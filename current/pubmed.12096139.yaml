abstract: Gain and loss of chromosomal material is characteristic of bladder cancer,
  as well as malignant transformation in general. The consequences of these changes
  at both the transcription and translation levels is at present unknown partly because
  of technical limitations. Here we have attempted to address this question in pairs
  of non-invasive and invasive human bladder tumors using a combination of technology
  that included comparative genomic hybridization, high density oligonucleotide array-based
  monitoring of transcript levels 5600 genes , and high resolution two-dimensional
  gel electrophoresis. The results showed that there is a gene dosage effect that
  in some cases superimposes on other regulatory mechanisms. This effect depended
  p amp lt 0.015 on the magnitude of the comparative genomic hybridization change.
  In general 18 of 23 cases , chromosomal areas with more than 2-fold gain of DNA
  showed a corresponding increase in mRNA transcripts. Areas with loss of DNA, on
  the other hand, showed either reduced or unaltered transcript levels. Because most
  proteins resolved by two-dimensional gels are unknown it was only possible to compare
  mRNA and protein alterations in relatively few cases of well focused abundant proteins.
  With few exceptions we found a good correlation p amp lt 0.005 between transcript
  alterations and protein levels. The implications, as well as limitations, of the
  approach are discussed.
