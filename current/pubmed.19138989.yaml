abstract: The study of oral premalignant lesions OPL is crucial to the identification
  of initiating genetic events in oral cancer. However, these lesions are minute in
  size, making it a challenge to recover sufficient DNA from microdissected cells
  for comprehensive genomic analysis. As a step toward identifying genetic aberrations
  associated with oral cancer progression, we used tiling-path array comparative genomic
  hybridization to compare alterations on chromosome 3p for 71 OPLs against 23 oral
  squamous cell carcinomas. 3p was chosen because although it is frequently altered
  in oral cancers and has been associated with progression risk, its alteration status
  has only been evaluated at a small number of loci in OPLs. We identified six recurrent
  losses in this region that were shared between high-grade dysplasias and oral squamous
  cell carcinomas, including a 2.89-Mbp deletion spanning the FHIT gene previously
  implicated in oral cancer progression . When the alteration status for these six
  regions was examined in 24 low-grade dysplasias with known progression outcome,
  we observed that they occurred at a significantly higher frequency in low-grade
  dysplasias that later progressed to later-stage disease P amp lt 0.003 . Moreover,
  parallel analysis of all profiled tissues showed that the extent of overall genomic
  alteration at 3p increased with histologic stage. This first high-resolution analysis
  of chromosome arm 3p in OPLs represents a significant step toward predicting progression
  risk in early preinvasive disease and provides a keen example of how genomic instability
  escalates with progression to invasive cancer.
