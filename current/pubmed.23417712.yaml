abstract: Recurrent mutations affecting the histone H3.3 residues Lys27 or indirectly
  Lys36 are frequent drivers of pediatric high-grade gliomas over 30 of HGGs . To
  identify additional driver mutations in HGGs, we investigated a cohort of 60 pediatric
  HGGs using whole-exome sequencing WES and compared them to 543 exomes from non-cancer
  control samples. We identified mutations in SETD2, a H3K36 trimethyltransferase,
  in 15 of pediatric HGGs, a result that was genome-wide significant FDR 0.029 . Most
  SETD2 alterations were truncating mutations. Sequencing the gene in this cohort
  and another validation cohort 123 gliomas from all ages and grades showed SETD2
  mutations to be specific to high-grade tumors affecting 15 of pediatric HGGs 11
  73 and 8 of adult HGGs 5 65 while no SETD2 mutations were identified in low-grade
  diffuse gliomas 0 45 . Furthermore, SETD2 mutations were mutually exclusive with
  H3F3A mutations in HGGs P 0.0492 while they partly overlapped with IDH1 mutations
  4 14 , and SETD2-mutant tumors were found exclusively in the cerebral hemispheres
  P 0.0055 . SETD2 is the only H3K36 trimethyltransferase in humans, and SETD2-mutant
  tumors showed a substantial decrease in H3K36me3 levels P lt 0.001 , indicating
  that the mutations are loss-of-function. These data suggest that loss-of-function
  SETD2 mutations occur in older children and young adults and are specific to HGG
  of the cerebral cortex, similar to the H3.3 G34R V and IDH mutations. Taken together,
  our results suggest that mutations disrupting the histone code at H3K36, including
  H3.3 G34R V, IDH1 and or SETD2 mutations, are central to the genesis of hemispheric
  HGGs in older children and young adults.
