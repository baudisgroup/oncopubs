abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a key regulatory growth factor
  activating many processes relevant to normal development and disease, affecting
  cell proliferation and survival. Here we use a combined approach to study the EGF
  dependent transcriptome of HeLa cells by using multiple long oligonucleotide based
  microarray platforms (from Agilent, Operon, and Illumina) in combination with digital
  gene expression profiling (DGE) with the Illumina Genome Analyzer. RESULTS: By applying
  a procedure for cross-platform data meta-analysis based on RankProd and GlobalAncova
  tests, we establish a well validated gene set with transcript levels altered after
  EGF treatment. We use this robust gene list to build higher order networks of gene
  interaction by interconnecting associated networks, supporting and extending the
  important role of the EGF signaling pathway in cancer. In addition, we find an entirely
  new set of genes previously unrelated to the currently accepted EGF associated cellular
  functions. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the use of global genomic cross-validation
  derived from high content technologies (microarrays or deep sequencing) can be used
  to generate more reliable datasets. This approach should help to improve the confidence
  of downstream in silico functional inference analyses based on high content data.'
