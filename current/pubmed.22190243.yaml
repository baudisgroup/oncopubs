abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas DIPG can not be cured with current treatment
  modalities. Targeted therapy in this disease would benefit from advanced technologies
  detecting relevant drugable mutations. Twenty patients with classic newly diagnosed
  DIPG underwent stereotactic biopsies and were analyzed for the presence of 983 different
  mutations in 115 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes using OncoMap, a mass spectrometric
  method of allele detection. Our results identified oncogenic mutations in TP53 40
  , PI3KCA 15 , and ATM MPL 5 while none were identified in a large number of other
  genes commonly mutated in malignant gliomas. The identification of oncogenic mutations
  in the PI3K pathway offers the potential of a therapeutic target at initial diagnosis
  in this devastating disease.
