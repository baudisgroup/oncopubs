abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis was used to identify chromosomal
  imbalances in 52 human primary hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs . The most prominent
  changes were gains of part or all of chromosome arms 8q 83 of cases and 1q 73 and
  loss of 16q 63 . Other commonly overrepresented sites were 5p, 7q, and Xq. Recurrent
  sites of DNA sequence amplification included 8q23--24 five cases and 11q13--14 four
  cases . Other frequently underrepresented sites were 4q, 8p, 16p, and 17p. Taken
  collectively, these findings and data from other CGH studies of HCCs define a subset
  of chromosome segments that are consistently over- or underrepresented and highlight
  sites of putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively, involved in
  hepatocellular oncogenesis. Loss of heterozygosity analysis with a panel of polymorphic
  microsatellite markers distributed along 16q defined a minimal region of chromosomal
  loss at 16q23.1--24.1, suggesting that this region harbors a tumor suppressor gene
  whose loss inactivation may contribute to the pathogenesis of many HCCs.
