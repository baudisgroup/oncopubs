abstract: AML MDS patients carrying 11q amplifications involving the mixed lineage
  leukemia gene MLL locus are characterized by a complex aberrant karyotype CAK frequently
  including deletions within 5q, 17p, and 7q, older age and fast progression of the
  disease with extremely poor prognosis. MLL has been shown to be overexpressed in
  cases with 11q amplification. However, in most of the cases, the amplified region
  is not restricted to the MLL locus. In this study, we investigated 19 patients with
  AML MDS and MLL gain amplification. By means of array CGH performed in 12 patients,
  we were able to delineate the minimal deleted regions within 5q and 17p and identified
  three independent regions 11q I-III that were amplified in all cases. Gene expression
  profiles established in 15 cases were used to identify candidate genes within these
  regions. Notably, analysis of our data suggests a correlation of loss of 5q and
  17p and expression of genes present in 11q23-25. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
  the gene expression signature can be used to discriminate AML MDS with MLL amplification
  from several other types of AML.
