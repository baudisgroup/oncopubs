abstract: The epidemiological relationship between squamous cell lung cancer SCC and
  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD , both smoking-related diseases, suggests
  that they have also a genetic basis. We compared 35 SCC patients with and without
  COPD with whole-genome gene expression profiles of laser microdissected tissue.
  Validation of differential expression was performed for 25 genes using quantitative
  q RT-PCR. Subsequently, we performed array-based CGH on the same tumor samples.
  We found that 374 probes were differentially expressed in SCC from patients with
  and without COPD. Forty-four probes were derived from genes with mitochondrial functions
  and 34 probes were located on 5q. All these probes showed a lower expression level
  in SCC from non-COPD patients. For a random selection of 25 mitochondrial and 5q
  genes, we confirmed the differential expression by qRT-PCR. Loss of 3p, 5q and 9p
  was observed, via array-CGH, to be more frequent in SCC from non-COPD patients as
  compared to SCC from COPD patients. Combination of chromosomal aberrations and the
  location of the differentially expressed genes showed significant association for
  loss of the 5q31.2-31.3 region and reduced expression of the 5q genes. In conclusion,
  a more frequent loss of 5q and a low expression of genes located on 5q in SCC tumors
  of non-COPD patients compared to tumors from COPD patients was identified suggesting
  that different oncogenetic pathways are operational in patients with and without
  COPD.
