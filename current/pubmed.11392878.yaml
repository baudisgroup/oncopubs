abstract: DNA copy number changes were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in 38 gastric carcinomas and correlated with tumor histologic type and progression.
  Gains of copy numbers were observed in all tumors, affecting all chromosomes except
  chromosome 16. The average number of copy number gains was 7 range, 1-13 , most
  frequently located on chromosomes 11, 12, 15, 17, and 20 in 45 to 97 of tumors.
  High-level amplifications were found on chromosomes 12, 15, 17, and 20 the latter
  was affected most frequently 66 . Loss of DNA copy numbers was detected in 14 tumors
  affecting 7 chromosomes. No statistically significant differences in the frequency
  and pattern of chromosomal imbalances were observed in tumor histologic type Lauren
  classification and grade of differentiation, as well as the prognostic parameters
  depth of invasion pT and lymph node involvement pN . Our results indicate that in
  gastric cancer there is no specific recurrent pattern of DNA aberrations to be correlated
  with tumor histologic type or stage. However, CGH analysis could reveal new, recurrent
  genetic changes in gastric cancer affecting chromosomes sites that harbor genes
  known to participate in tumorigenesis and progression of several human malignant
  neoplasms.
