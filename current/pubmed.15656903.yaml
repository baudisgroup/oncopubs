abstract: Conventional Comparative Genomic Hybridization CGH has been widely used
  for detecting copy number alterations in cancer and for identifying regions containing
  candidate tumor responsible genes. Recently, several studies have shown the utility
  of cDNA microarray CGH for studing gene copy changes in various types of tumors.
  However, no such studies on T-cell lymphomas have been performed. To date T-cell
  lymphomas analyzed by the use of chromosome CGH have revealed only slight copy number
  alterations and not gene amplifications.
