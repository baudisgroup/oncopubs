abstract: Adrenocortical tumors ACT are rare neoplasms of the adrenal glands accounting
  for 0.2 of all pediatric cancers. However, the incidence of ACT in South Brazilian
  children is 10 to 15 times greater than the worldwide incidence. Comparative genomic
  hybridization studies have revealed the presence of a high degree of chromosomal
  instability in ACT. We evaluated 16 ACT, 8 of them carcinomas and 8 adenomas. The
  presence of changes in DNA copy numbers was determined by comparative genomic hybridization,
  and the findings were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction on the basis
  of IGF-II gene expression. The adenomas showed a mean of 19.7 imbalances per case,
  with the most frequent gain and loss being 4p15.1-p15.3 and 20p11.2-p13.2, respectively.
  The carcinomas presented with a mean of 35.5 imbalances per case, with the more
  frequent gain being 2q14.1-q24.3 and the more frequent losses being 3q21-q26.2,
  20q12-qter, and 22q11.2-q13.3. The most frequent imbalances in both adenomas and
  carcinomas were gains of 1p21-p31.2, 2p12-p21 and loss of 20p11.2-p12. The expression
  of IGF-II mRNA 11p15.5 was higher in samples that presented with a gain of this
  region. It has been established that great genomic instability exists in pediatric
  ACT.
