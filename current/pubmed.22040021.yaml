abstract: In addition to clinical characteristics, DNA aneuploidy has been identified
  as a prognostic factor in epithelial malignancies in general and in endometrial
  cancers in particular. We mapped ploidy-associated chromosomal aberrations and identified
  corresponding gene and protein expression changes in endometrial cancers of different
  prognostic subgroups.
