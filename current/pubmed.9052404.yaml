abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analyses were performed on 27 human
  pleural mesothelioma tumour specimens, consisting of 18 frozen tumours and nine
  paraffin-embedded tumours, to screen for gains and losses of DNA sequences. Copy
  number changes were detected in 15 of the 27 specimens with a range from one to
  eight per specimen. On average, more losses than gains of genetic material were
  observed. The loss of DNA sequences occurred most commonly in the short arm of chromosome
  9 p21-pter , in 60 of the abnormal specimens. Other losses among the abnormal specimens
  were frequently detected in the long arms of chromosomes 4 q31.1-qter, 20 , 6 q22-q24,
  33 , 13 33 ,14 q24-qter, 33 and 22 q13, 20 . A gain in DNA sequences was found in
  the long arm of chromosome 1 cen-qter in 33 of the abnormal specimens. Our analysis
  is the first genome-wide screening for gains and losses of DNA sequences using comparative
  genomic hybridization in malignant pleural mesothelioma tumours. The recurrent DNA
  sequence changes detected in this study suggest that the corresponding chromosomal
  areas most probably contain genes important for the initiation and progression of
  mesothelioma.
