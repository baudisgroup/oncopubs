abstract: Germline mutations in BRCA1 2 increase the lifetime risk for breast and
  ovarian cancer dramatically. Identification of such mutations is important for optimal
  treatment decisions and pre-symptomatic mutation screening in family members. Although
  current DNA diagnostics is able to identify many different mutations, it remains
  unclear, how many BRCA2-associated breast cancer cases remain unidentified as such.
  In addition, mutation scanning detects many unclassified variants UV for which the
  clinical relevance is uncertain. Therefore, our aim was to develop a test to identify
  BRCA2-association in breast tumors based on the genomic signature. A BRCA2-classifier
  was built using array-CGH profiles of 28 BRCA2-mutated and 28 sporadic breast tumors.
  The classifier was validated on an independent group of 19 BRCA2-mutated and 19
  sporadic breast tumors. Subsequently, we tested 89 breast tumors from suspected
  hereditary breast and ovarian cancer HBOC families, in which either no BRCA1 2 mutation
  or an UV had been found by routine diagnostics. The classifier showed a sensitivity
  of 89 and specificity of 84 on the validation set of known BRCA2-mutation carriers
  and sporadic tumor cases. Of the 89 HBOC cases, 17 presented a BRCA2-like profile.
  In three of these cases additional indications for BRCA2-deficiency were found.
  Chromosomal aberrations that were specific for BRCA2-mutated tumors included loss
  on chromosome arm 13q and 14q, and gain on 17q. Since we could separate BRCA1-like,
  BRCA2-like, and sporadic-like tumors, using our current BRCA2- and previous BRCA1-classifier,
  this method of breast tumor classification could be applied as additional test for
  current diagnostics to help clinicians in decision making and classifying sequence
  variants of unknown significance.
