abstract: 'Triple-negative breast cancer TNBC is defined by a lack of expression of
  estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, and genetically most of them fall into
  the basal subgroup of breast cancer. The important issue of TNBC is poorer clinical
  outcome and absence of effective targeted therapy. In this study, we sought to identify
  DNA copy number alterations and expression of relevant genes characteristic of TNBC
  to discover potential therapeutic targets. Frozen tissues from 114 breast cancers
  were analyzed using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. The
  classification into subtype was determined by estrogen and progesterone receptor
  expression, and by the presence or absence of gain on the ERBB2 containing clone.
  The ACE algorithm was used for calling gain and loss of clones. Twenty-eight cases
  25 were classified as TNBC. Recurrent gains amp gt or 25 unique to TNBC were 9p24-p21,
  10p15-p13, 12p13, 13q31-q34, 18q12, 18q21-q23, and 21q22. Two published gene expression
  array data sets comparing basal subtype versus other subtype breast cancers were
  used for searching candidate genes. Of the genes upregulated in the basal subtype,
  45 of 686 genes in one data set and 59 of 1,428 in the second data set were found
  to be located in the gained regions. Of these candidate genes, gain of NFIB 9p24.1
  was specific for TNBC in a validation set by real-time PCR. In conclusion, we have
  identified recurrently gained regions characteristic of TNBC, and found that NFIB
  copy number and expression is increased in TNBC across the data sets. This article
