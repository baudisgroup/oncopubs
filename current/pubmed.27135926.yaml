abstract: 'We analysed whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers to advance understanding
  of the driver mutations conferring clonal advantage and the mutational processes
  generating somatic mutations. We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried
  probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies,
  but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation
  rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended
  to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement
  signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications
  or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA
  repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2
  function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic
  mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire
  of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive
  account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.'
