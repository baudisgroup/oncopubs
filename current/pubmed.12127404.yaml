abstract: To clarify the mechanism of tumorigenesis in papillary thyroid carcinoma
  PTC and ascertain whether genomic changes correlate with histologic features, we
  conducted a comprehensive molecular evaluation of PTC using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and microsatellite instability MSI analysis in a set of 17 histologically
  well-characterized PTC specimens. To our knowledge, this is the first study that
  evaluates chromosomal and nucleotide instability in the same PTC tumor specimens.
  Four of 15 samples 27 had aberrations detected by CGH. All four had a partial or
  complete gain of chromosome 20, and 3 of 4 had a partial or complete loss of chromosome
  13. No MSI was detected in any of the PTC samples n 16 , and all samples examined
  by immunohistochemistry n 9 expressed the DNA repair enzymes hmlh1 and hmsh2. All
  PTC samples with abnormal CGH had vascular invasion or invasion of the thyroid capsule,
  and there was a significant correlation between the presence of chromosomal aberrations
  and capsular vascular invasion P 0.026 . We conclude that although chromosomal and
  microsatellite instability are uncommon in PTC, tumors with chromosomal aberrations
  are more likely to be associated with invasion.
