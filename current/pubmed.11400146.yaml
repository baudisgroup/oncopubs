abstract: Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck generally exhibit complex
  karyotypes. To gain better knowledge of the changes in the subgroup of laryngeal
  and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, chromosomal gains and losses were investigated
  in 42 predominantly late-stage tumours, using comparative genomic hybridization.
  On average, 11.2 gains and 6.8 losses were found. Gains were detected in high frequencies
  at 1q, 3q, 5p, 7q, 8q, 11q13, 17q, and 18p, and losses at 3p, 4p, 5q, 11qter, and
  18q. Neither the number nor the type of abnormalities, nor the occurrence of specific
  chromosome changes, was found to be related to DNA ploidy, tumour stage, or degree
  of differentiation. Apart from low-level gains, many high-level amplifications were
  identified, in particular 3q24-qter 15 cases . Other regions recurrently involved
  were 11q13 7 cases , 18p 5 cases , 18q11.2 4 cases , and 8q23-24 and 11q14-22 3
  cases . Many of these amplified regions have not been reported before. Over half
  of all loci harbour genes coding for growth factors and growth factor receptors,
  suggesting an important role for such genes in squamous cell tumourigenesis and
  in the progression of late-stage tumours.
