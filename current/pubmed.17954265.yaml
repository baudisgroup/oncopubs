abstract: 'Medulloblastoma is a malignant invasive embryonal tumor, occurring in children
  mainly. It is rare in adults amp lt 1 of adult brain tumors , and so comprehensive
  cytogenetic and molecular biological data on adult medulloblastomas are very limited.
  Conventional therapies provide disappointing long-term disease control, and new
  therapeutic options are being tested. We performed comprehensive cytogenetic analyses
  of an adult medulloblastoma, WHO grade IV, using trypsin-Giemsa staining GTG-banding
  , multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization M-FISH , and locus-specific FISH,
  complemented by molecular karyotyping using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP arrays. GTG-banding of 25 metaphases revealed 31 structural chromosomal aberrations,
  predominantly located on chromosomes 4q, 9q, 10q, 11p, and 20q, which were confirmed
  by M-FISH. Two novel, so far not described translocations were found: t 4 11 q25
  p15 and t 9 20 p23 p12 . GTG-banding, locus-specific FISH, and M-FISH detected numerical
  changes of chromosomes 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22. Molecular karyotyping by SNP
  array confirmed chromosomal changes -2p, -10q, -16q, and -Xq and revealed de novo
  partial uniparental disomy 1q and 9q. Applying an upcoming therapeutic approach,
  we found that primary medulloblastoma cells were resistant to TRAIL, a novel anticancer
  cytokine, but could be efficiently sensitized by cotreatment with the proteasome
  inhibitor bortezomib. Bortezomib-TRAIL cotreatment may serve as a powerful therapeutic
  option for medulloblastoma patients.'
