abstract: We performed an integrated array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH
  and expression microarray analysis of 8 normal gastric tissues and 38 primary tumors,
  including 25 intestinal and 13 diffuse gastric adenocarcinomas to identify genes
  whose expression is deregulated in association with copy number alteration. Our
  aim was also to identify molecular genetic alterations that are specific to particular
  clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer. Distinct molecular genetic
  profiles were identified for intestinal and diffuse gastric cancers and for tumors
  obtained from 2 different locations of the stomach. Interestingly, the ERBB2 amplification
  and gains at 20q13.12-q13.33 almost exclusively discriminated intestinal cancers
  from the diffuse type. In addition, the 17q12-q25 gain was characteristic to cancers
  located in corpus and the 20q13.12-q13.13 gain was more common in the antrum. Statistical
  analysis was performed using integrated copy number and expression data to identify
  genes showing differential expression associated with a copy number alteration.
  Genes with the highest statistical significance included ERBB2, MUC1, GRB7, PPP1R1B
  and PPARBP with concomitant changes in copy number and expression. Immunohistochemical
  analysis of ERBB2 and MUC1 on a tissue microarray containing 78 independent gastric
  tissues showed statistically significant differences p amp lt 0.05 and amp lt 0.001
  in immunopositivity in the intestinal 31 and 70 and diffuse subtypes 14 and 41 ,
  respectively. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that intestinal and diffuse
  type gastric cancers as well as cancers located in different sites of the stomach
  have distinct molecular profiles which may have clinical value.
