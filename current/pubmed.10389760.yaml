abstract: Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg H and RS cells are generally considered to be
  the neoplastic cells of Hodgkins disease HD however, such cells are found only in
  a minority of HD lesions. Very few data have so far been published on the cytogenetic
  abnormalities in HD. An analysis of unknown genetic aberrations has only recently
  become possible through the use of comparative genomic hybridization CGH , which
  is based on the competitive binding of tumor and control DNA to metaphase chromosomes.
  In order to exclude the reaction of non-tumor cells, we used 100 sorted H-RS cells
  as the tumor DNA, then 100 sorted reactive T cells or B cells as the control DNA.
  We obtained the amplified DNA, using degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase
  chain reaction DOP-PCR . In addition, to confirm whether or not the lymphocytes
  in the background were reactive, we performed CGH with 100 sorted B cells and 100
  sorted T cells. CGH was thus performed on 9 HDs, including 6 cases of mixed-cellularity
  MC sub-type and 3 cases of nodular-sclerosis NS sub-type. CGH of the B and T cells
  showed no genetic changes in any cases. In contrast, CGH of H-RS cells revealed
  both gains and losses of DNA in all 9 cases, and multiple changes were also observed.
  In situ hybridization showed an Epstein-Barr-virus infection in 5 cases of MC however,
  no definite relationship was observed between the EBV infection and genetic changes.
  The most commonly observed genetic aberrations were a loss on 16q11 21 in 6 cases,
  a gain on 1p13 in 5 cases, and a gain on 7q35 36 in 5 cases. The large number of
  chromosomal alterations in HD suggests, therefore, that an increased degree of genetic
  instability play a role in the formation of H-RS cells.
