abstract: In order to investigate typical genomic alterations in patients with Recklinghausens
  disease NF1 we studied one from each of the six patients with NF1 several benign
  and or malignant tumors. By means of comparative genomic hybridization CGH gained
  results from six benign neurofibromas and 14 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
  MPNSTs were compared with four benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors BPNSTs from
  patients without NF1. In all 14 MPNSTs DNA sequence copy number changes were detected
  with a mean value of 13.5 imbalances per sample. The most frequent gains were in
  8q, 17q 12 tumors each , 7p, 15q ten tumors each , and 7q nine tumors . We found
  ten high-level amplifications in nine of the 14 samples. In two cases, the high-level
  amplification involved 7p14-pter and 17q24-qter as well. The most frequent loss
  was in 17p seven tumors . The benign neurofibromas from NF1-patients and the sporadic
  BPNSTs revealed only partially DNA sequence copy number changes without any distinct
  pattern. The gains of 7, 8q, 15q, and 17q were found exclusively in MPNSTs but not
  in neurofibromas and are supposed to be associated with malignant tumor progression.
  In comparison of the results of the 14 MPNSTs from NF1-patients with the results
  of previously published 20 sporadic MPNSTs, we found that the gain of 8q occurs
  most frequently in both tumor groups. Of course additionally in the sporadic MPNSTs
  there were more frequent gains of 5p, 6, and statistically significant gains of
  20q. On the other hand in the MPNSTs from NF1-patients the most frequent gains were
  found in 7, and statistically significant in 15q, and 17q.
