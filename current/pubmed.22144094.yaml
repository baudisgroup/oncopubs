abstract: Oral fields of visually normal and non-dysplastic mucosa ODFs may represent
  the precursors of oral potentially malignant lesions OPMLs . Aim of the study was
  to provide new evidence for the concept of the amp quot field carcinogenesis amp
  quot model by comparing the ODF and OPML genomic aberration profiles obtained by
  high resolution DNA flow cytometry hr DNA-FCM and array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization
  a-CGH . A second aim was to investigate if specific CGH aberrations were associated
  with DNA aneuploidy.
