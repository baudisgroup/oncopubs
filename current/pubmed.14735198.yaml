abstract: 'The genetic alterations that underlie the progression of follicular thyroid
  carcinoma towards anaplasia are still largely uncharacterised. We compared the Comparative
  Genomic Hybridization CGH profiles of 20 follicular FTCs , 12 poorly differentiated
  PDTCs and seven anaplastic thyroid carcinomas ATCs , in order to identify the chromosomal
  imbalances potentially associated with cancer progression. We found: i when considering
  that a direct transformation of FTC towards anaplasia occurs, the defined significantly
  important alterations were the increase of gains at 3q P amp lt 0.05 and 20q P amp
  lt 0.01 , and the increase of losses at 7q P amp lt 0.05 and Xp P amp lt 0.01 ii
  regarding poorly differentiated carcinomas as an intermediate independent entity
  in the anaplastic transformation of follicular cancers, evidenced as important alterations
  towards anaplasia, were the proportional decrease in copy sequences at 7p, 7q, 12q
  and 13q resulting from the significant decrease of DNA gains at 7p and 12q P amp
  lt 0.05 , and the significant increase of losses at 7q and 13q P amp lt 0.05 . These
  results unveil the chromosomal regions where genes of interest in thyroid anaplastic
  transformation are to be located, and demonstrate that different gene dosage copy
  sequence imbalances are associated to the direct pathway of transformation of follicular
  into anaplastic cancers and to the progressive FTC -- amp gt PDTC -- amp gt ATC
  pathway.'
