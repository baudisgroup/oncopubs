abstract: In this study, we have analyzed the expression of TRIM24 TIF-1 , a negative
  regulator of various transcription factors including nuclear receptors and p53 at
  the genomic, mRNA, and protein levels in human breast tumors. In breast cancer biopsy
  specimens, TRIM24 TIF-1 mRNA levels assessed by Real-Time Quantitative PCR or microarray
  expression profiling were increased as compared to normal breast tissues. At the
  genomic level, array comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed that the
  TRIM24 TIF-1 locus 7q34 exhibited both gains and losses that correlated with mRNA
  levels. By re-analyzing a series of 238 tumors, high levels of TRIM24 TIF-1 mRNA
  significantly correlated with various markers of poor prognosis such as the molecular
  subtype and were associated with worse overall survival. By using a rabbit polyclonal
  antibody for immunochemistry, the TRIM24 TIF-1 protein was detected in nuclei of
  normal luminal epithelial breast cells, but not in myoepithelial cells. Tissue microarray
  analysis confirmed that its expression was increased in epithelial cells from normal
  to breast infiltrating duct carcinoma and correlated with worse overall survival.
  Altogether, this work is the first study that shows that overexpression of the TRIM24
  TIF-1 gene in breast cancer is associated with poor prognosis and worse survival,
  and it suggests that this transcription coregulator may play a role in mammary carcinogenesis
  and represent a novel prognostic marker.
