abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was employed to survey genomic regions
  with increased and decreased copy number of the DNA sequence in 15 endometrial cancers
  10 cases with microsatellite instability positive MI and 5 cases with MI- . Twelve
  of these 15 tumors 80 showed abnormalities in copy number at one or more of the
  chromosomal regions. There were no regions with frequent chromosomal losses. Conversely,
  11 of 15 cases 73 showed gains on chromosome arms 1q 8 15 53 and or 8q 6 15 40 .
  Concordant gains of both chromosome arms 1q and 8q were observed in all three endometrial
  cancers of histological grade 3. These results suggest that these two chromosomal
  regions may contain genes whose increased expression contributes to development
  and or progression of endometrial carcinogenesis. Two cases were further analyzed
  by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH using three probes on chromosome 1 and
  two probes on chromosome 8 to more accurately determine increases in copy number.
  We found gains of chromosome 1q to 2.9-3.6 copies per cell and on 8q to 4.4 copies
  per cell.
