abstract: The SLC8A1 gene, which encodes the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, has a key role
  in calcium homeostasis. Our previous gene expression oligoarray data revealed SLC8A1
  under expression in penile carcinoma. We investigated whether dysregulation of SLC8A1
  expression is associated with apoptosis and cell proliferation in penile carcinoma
  via modulation of the calcium concentration. The underlying mechanisms of SLC8A1
  under expression were also explored, focusing on copy number alteration and miRNA.  Transcript
  levels of the SLC8A1 gene and miR-223 were evaluated by quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction to compare penile carcinoma samples with normal glans tissue. SLC8A1
  copy number was evaluated by microarray based comparative genomic hybridization.
  In normal and tumor samples we investigated caspase-3 and Ki-67 immunostaining as
  well as calcium distribution by laser ablation imaging inductively coupled plasma
  mass spectrometry.  SLC8A1 under expression was detected in penile carcinoma samples
  (p = 0.001), confirming our previous data. It was not associated with gene copy
  number loss. In contrast, miR-223 over expression (p = 0.002) inversely correlated
  with its putative repressor SLC8A1 (r = -0.426, p = 0.015). SLC8A1 under expression
  was associated with decreased calcium distribution, high Ki-67 and low caspase-3
  immunoexpression in penile carcinoma compared to normal tissue.  Down-regulation
  of the SLC8A1 gene, most likely mediated by its regulator miR-223, can lead to decreased
  calcium in penile carcinoma and consequently to suppressed apoptosis and increased
  tumor cell proliferation. These data suggest that the miR-223-NCX1-calcium signaling
  axis may represent a potential therapeutic approach to penile carcinoma.  Copyright
