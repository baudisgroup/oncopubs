abstract: To find similarities that may possibly indicate novel mutations, we performed
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis following degenerate oligonucleotide
  primed polymerase chain reaction PCR for DNA obtained from unique material of breast
  cancer that developed in monozygotic twin-pairs. Polymerase chain reaction amplification
  was successful in 12 samples for 11 patients, including 3 pairs. Six samples exhibited
  DNA copy number changes. Gains 76 were more frequent than losses 24 . Gains or high-level
  amplifications in 8q were present in all but 1 of the abnormal cases. Frequent gains
  were detected with a minimal common overlapping region at 5p 4 cases , at 1q25-qter
  3 cases , and at 20q12-qter 2 cases . The most frequent loss, detected in half of
  the abnormal cases, was at 1p32-pter. One twin-pair showed similar changes in 4
  chromosomal locations involving loss of 1p32-pter and gains in 1q25-qter, 5, and
  8q.
