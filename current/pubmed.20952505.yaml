abstract: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma RCC is the most common and invasive adult
  kidney cancer. The genetic and biological mechanisms that drive metastatic spread
  of RCC remain largely unknown. We have investigated the molecular signatures and
  underlying genomic aberrations associated with RCC metastasis, using an approach
  that combines a human xenograft model expression profiling of RNA, DNA, and microRNA
  miRNA functional verification and clinical validation. We show that increased metastatic
  activity is associated with acquisition of a myofibroblast-like signature in both
  tumor cell lines and in metastatic tumor biopsies. Our results also show that the
  mesenchymal trait did not provide an invasive advantage to the metastatic tumor
  cells. We further show that some of the constituents of the mesenchymal signature,
  including the expression of the well-characterized myofibroblastic marker S100A4,
  are functionally relevant. Epigenetic silencing and miRNA-induced expression changes
  accounted for the change in expression of a significant number of genes, including
  S100A4, in the myofibroblastic signature however, DNA copy number variation did
  not affect the same set of genes. These findings provide evidence that widespread
  genetic and epigenetic alterations can lead directly to global deregulation of gene
  expression and contribute to the development or progression of RCC metastasis culminating
  in a highly malignant myofibroblast-like cell.
