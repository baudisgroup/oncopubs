abstract: CLL-associated gene mutations that influence CLL cell fitness and chemotherapy
  resistance should increase in clonal representation when measured before therapy
  and at relapse.  To uncover mutations associated with CLL relapse, we have performed
  whole exome sequencing (WES) in a discovery cohort of sixty-one relapsed CLL patients
  identifying eighty-six recurrently mutated genes. The variant allele fractions (VAFs)
  of nineteen genes with mutations in {greater than or equal to} 3/61 cases were measured
  in fifty-three paired pre- and post-treatment CLL samples sorted to purity using
  panel-based deep re-sequencing or by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).  We identify mutations
  in TP53 as the dominant subclonal gene driver of relapsed CLL often demonstrating
  substantial increases in VAFs. Subclonal mutations in SAMHD1 also recurrently demonstrated
  increased VAFs at relapse. Mutations in ATP10A, FAT3, FAM50A and MGA, although infrequent,
  demonstrated enrichment in {greater than or equal to}2 cases each. In contrast,
  mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, POT1, FBXW7, MYD88, NXF1, XPO1, ZMYM3 or CHD2 were predominantly
  already clonal prior to therapy indicative of a pre-treatment pathogenetic driver
  role in CLL. Quantitative analyses of clonal dynamics uncovers rising, stable and
  falling clones and subclones without clear evidence that gene mutations other than
  in TP53 and possibly SAMHD1 are frequently selected for at CLL relapse.  Data in
  aggregate support a provisional categorization of CLL-associated recurrently mutated
  genes into three classes i) often subclonal pre-therapy and strongly enriched after
  therapy, or, ii) mostly clonal pre-therapy or without further enrichments at relapse,
  or, iii) subclonal before and after therapy and enriching only in sporadic cases.  Copyright
