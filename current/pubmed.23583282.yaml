abstract: 'The molecular genetic alterations underlying the development and diversity
  of salivary gland carcinomas are largely unknown. To characterize these events,
  comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed, using a single-nucleotide
  polymorphism microarray platform, of 60 fresh-frozen specimens that represent the
  main salivary carcinoma types: mucoepidermoid carcinoma MEC , adenoid cystic carcinoma
  ACC , and salivary duct carcinoma SDC . The results were correlated with the clinicopathologic
  features and translocation statuses to characterize the genetic alterations. The
  most commonly shared copy number abnormalities CNAs in all types were losses at
  chromosomes 6q23-26 and the 9p21 region. Subtype-specific CNAs included a loss at
  12q11-12 in ACC and a gain at 17q11-12 in SDC. Focal copy number losses included
  1p36.33-p36-22 in ACC, 9p13.2 in MEC, and 3p12.3-q11-2, 6q21-22.1, 12q14.1, and
  12q15 in SDC. Tumor-specific amplicons were identified at 11q23.3 PVRL1 in ACC,
  11q13.3 NUMA1 in MEC, and 6p21.1 CCND3 , 9p13.2 PAX5 , 12q15 CNOT2 RAB3IP , 12q21.1
  GLIPR1L1 , and 17q12 ERBB2 CCL4 in SDC. A comparative CNA analysis of fusion-positive
  and fusion-negative ACCs and MECs revealed relatively lower CNAs in fusion-positive
  tumors than in fusion-negative tumors in both tumor types. An association between
  CNAs and high grade and advanced stage was observed in MECs only. These findings
  support the pathogenetic segregation of these entities and define novel chromosomal
  sites for future identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.'
