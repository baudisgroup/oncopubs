abstract: Chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle to successful treatment
  of ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, increased knowledge of underlying mechanisms
  and identification of predictive factors are of great importance. Standard treatment
  for ovarian carcinoma is surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. In this
  study, we aimed to search for genes or genomic regions involved in platinum resistance
  in ovarian carcinoma. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used
  to identify genetic alterations in 32 early-stage epithelial ovarian carcinomas
  homogeneously treated with single-agent carboplatin. The arrays contain 33,370 bacterial
  artificial chromosome BAC clones and form a contiguous and tiling coverage of the
  human genome with an average resolution of approximately 100 kb. We found certain
  genetic changes associated with carboplatin response. Gains in 1q25.1-q41 were significantly
  more frequent in carboplatin-resistant tumours. In this region, we further detected
  two smallest regions of overlap SRO at 1q25.2 and 1q32.2 approximately 690 and approximately
  830 kb in size, respectively . Interestingly, we found some regions that were lost
  exclusively in the sensitive tumours 17q24.1, Xq21.33-q22.1, and 6 regions in 15q.
  We also detected genetic differences with regard to histologic subtype. Gain in
  8q was found highly associated with serous and clear cell subtypes, and an SRO was
  identified at 8q24.22-q24.23. The genomic regions found altered in this study confirm
  some of our previous metaphase CGH results. The alteration found in chromosome arm
  1q was verified and specified, and is therefore of great interest as a candidate
  for predictive markers. Identifying predictive markers of chemosensitive and chemoresistant
  disease would greatly help in the choice of chemotherapy in the clinic, and thus
  improve treatment of women with ovarian cancer.
