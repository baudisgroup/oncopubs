abstract: Metastasis is the main cause of cancer mortality but its process remains
  poorly understood and thus hampers more effective treatment and improved cancer
  prognosis. To search for metastasis driver genes responsible for tumor spread, we
  integrated genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 61 matched primary tumors and
  distant metastases of liver or colorectal carcinoma isolated by laser-capture microdissection
  and assayed by array-based technologies. We found that primary tumor lesions and
  their matched distant metastases were largely similar at the genomic and transcriptomic
  levels, but substantial differences could be found between primary tumors with or
  without accompanying metastases. Interestingly, metastasis genes were principally
  tumor type and organ site-specific. Despite distinct pathway enrichment, different
  metastasis gene sets shared common prognostic capacity and were predictive of hepatocellular
  carcinoma survival in an independent cohort. Thus, the metastatic propensity is
  inherent to the primary tumor and the lack of general metastasis genes necessitates
  the development of specific treatment modalities.
