abstract: The majority of classical tumor suppressor genes, such as CDKN2A or RB1,
  were identified by delineation of biallelic losses called homozygous deletions.
  To systematically identify homozygous deletions in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
  and to unravel novel putative tumor suppressor genes we screened three laryngeal
  squamous cell carcinoma cell lines LSCC using array comparative genomic hybridization
  array-CGH . Out of 31 candidate regions for homozygous deletions identified by array-CGH,
  5 were verified further by PCR. Among others, these homozygous deletions affected
  the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A and the apoptosis-inducing STK17A gene. To assess
  the frequency of the identified deletions we investigated the affected sites in
  9 additional LSCC cell lines. In 5 of the 9 cell lines the CDKN2A gene was homozygously
  lost. Thus, CDKN2A was homozygously deleted in 7 of the 12 cell lines. No other
  recurrent homozygous deletions were found. Homozygous deletions was a frequent mechanism
  of CDKN2A inactivation. Moreover, we identified several other genes, including the
  putative tumor suppressor gene STK17A, which may be inactivated by homozygous deletions
  and thus are potentially implicated in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma development.
