abstract: 'Small intestine neuroendocrine tumors SI-NETs are the most common malignancy
  of the small bowel. Several clinical trials target PI3K Akt mTOR signaling however,
  it is unknown whether these or other genes are genetically altered in these tumors.
  To address the underlying genetics, we analyzed 48 SI-NETs by massively parallel
  exome sequencing. We detected an average of 0.1 somatic single nucleotide variants
  SNVs per 106 nucleotides range, 0-0.59 , mostly transitions C gt T and A gt G ,
  which suggests that SI-NETs are stable cancers. 197 protein-altering somatic SNVs
  affected a preponderance of cancer genes, including FGFR2, MEN1, HOOK3, EZH2, MLF1,
  CARD11, VHL, NONO, and SMAD1. Integrative analysis of SNVs and somatic copy number
  variations identified recurrently altered mechanisms of carcinogenesis: chromatin
  remodeling, DNA damage, apoptosis, RAS signaling, and axon guidance. Candidate therapeutically
  relevant alterations were found in 35 patients, including SRC, SMAD family genes,
  AURKA, EGFR, HSP90, and PDGFR. Mutually exclusive amplification of AKT1 or AKT2
  was the most common event in the 16 patients with alterations of PI3K Akt mTOR signaling.
  We conclude that sequencing-based analysis may provide provisional grouping of SI-NETs
  by therapeutic targets or deregulated pathways.'
