abstract: Chordomas are rare neoplasms, arising from notochordal remnants in the midline
  skeletal axis, for which the current treatment is limited to surgery and radiotherapy.
  Recent reports suggest that receptor tyrosine kinases RTK might be essential for
  the survival or proliferation of chordoma cells, providing a rationale for RTK targeted
  therapy. Nevertheless, the reported data are conflicting, most likely due to the
  assorted tumor specimens used for the studies and the heterogeneous methodological
  approaches. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive characterization
  of this rare entity using a wide range of assays in search for relevant therapeutic
  targets.
