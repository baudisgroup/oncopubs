abstract: 'Leiomyosarcoma LMS is a rare malignant mesenchymal tumor of smooth muscle
  cells. Chromosomal aberrations in LMS have been studied, but the cytogenetic data
  that have been published so far are complex, limited, and incomplete. Here, we performed
  for the first time a high-resolution genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis aCGH on a pool of 14 low- and high-grade LMS cases to obtain gene-level
  information about the amplified and deleted regions that may play a role in the
  development and progression of LMS. Our aCGH results indicated that 2,218 genes
  were involved in 25 altered chromosomal regions 9 regions in low-grade LMS, 12 regions
  in high-grade LMS, and 4 minimal common regions shared by low- and high-grade LMS.
  The frequency of DNA copy number gains in high-grade LMS was threefold compared
  to low-grade LMS, whereas losses in low-grade LMS were almost twice as frequent
  as in high-grade LMS. Both low- and high-grade tumors shared two minimal common
  regions of gain 15q26 approximately qter and 17p13.1 approximately q11 and loss
  6p12 approximately p21.3 and 13q14.3 approximately qter . Moreover, our findings
  indicated that low- and high-grade LMS and osteosarcoma share 12 genes located in
  the 17p amplicon. In conclusion, by using aCGH, we were able to define the precise
  location of the altered chromosomal areas and to identify putative tumor suppressor
  genes and oncogenes therein. The list of altered genes in the minimal common regions
  is available as at our web site http: www.helsinki.fi cmg microarray_data .'
