abstract: Despite the recent consensus on the eligibility of adjuvant systemic therapy
  in patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer NNBC based on clinicopathologic
  criteria, specific biological markers are needed to predict sensitivity to the different
  available therapeutic options. We examined the feasibility of developing a genomic
  predictor of chemotherapy response and recurrence risk in 185 patients with NNBC
  using assembled arrays containing 2,460 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for
  scanning the genome for DNA copy number changes. After surgery, 90 patients received
  anthracycline-based chemotherapy, whereas 95 did not. Tamoxifen was administered
  to patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors. The association of genomic and
  clinicopathologic data and outcome was computed using Cox proportional hazard models
  and multiple testing adjustment procedures. Analysis of NNBC genomes revealed a
  common genomic signature. Specific DNA copy number aberrations were associated with
  hormonal receptor status, but not with other clinicopathologic variables. In patients
  treated with chemotherapy, none of the genomic changes were significantly correlated
  with recurrence. In patients not receiving chemotherapy, deletion of eight bacterial
  artificial chromosome clones clustered to chromosome 11q was independently associated
  with relapse disease-free survival at 10 years -SE, 40 -14 versus 86 -6 P amp lt
  0.0001 . The 54 patients with deletion of 11q 29 did not present more aggressive
  clinicopathologic features than those without 11q loss. The adverse influence of
  11q deletion on clinical outcome was confirmed in an independent validation series
  of 88 patients with NNBC. Our data suggests that patients with NNBC with the 11q
  deletion might benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite other clinical,
  pathologic, or genetic features. However, these initial findings should be evaluated
  in randomized clinical trials.
