abstract: Chromosomal abnormalities, like deletions, amplifications, inversions or
  translocations, are recurrent features in haematological malignancies. However,
  the precise molecular breakpoints are frequently not determined. Here we describe
  a rapid analysis of genetic imbalances combining fine tiling comparative genomic
  hybridization FT-CGH and ligation-mediated PCR LM-PCR . We clarified an inv 14 q11q32
  in a case of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with a breakpoint in the TRA D
  in 68 of cells detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. FT-CGH showed several
  mono- and biallelic losses within TRA D. LM-PCR disclosed a TRA D rearrangement
  on one allele. The other allele revealed an inv 14 q11q32 , joining TRDD2 at 21,977,000
  of 14q11 together with the IGH locus at 105,948,000 and 3-sequence of TRAC at 22,092,000
  joined together with IGHV4-61 at 106,166,000. This sensitive approach can unravel
  complex chromosomal abnormalities in patient samples with a limited amount of aberrant
  cells and may lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic options.
