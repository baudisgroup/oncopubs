abstract: Exposure to asbestos is known to induce lung cancer, and our previous studies
  have suggested that specific chromosomal regions, such as 19p13, are preferentially
  aberrant in lung tumours of asbestos-exposed patients. Here, we further examined
  the association between the 19p region and exposure to asbestos using array comparative
  genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH in lung tumours
  and FISH characterization of asbestos-induced micronuclei MN in human bronchial
  epithelial BEAS 2B cells in vitro. We detected an increased number of 19p losses
  in the tumours of asbestos-exposed patients in comparison with tumours from non-exposed
  subjects with similar distribution of tumour histology in both groups 13 33 39 versus
  3 25 12 , P 0.04 . In BEAS 2B cells, a 48 h exposure to crocidolite asbestos 2.0
  microg cm 2 was found to induce centromere-negative MN-harbouring chromosomal fragments.
  Furthermore, an increased frequency of rare MN containing a 19p fragment was observed
  after the crocidolite treatment in comparison with untreated controls 6 6000 versus
  1 10 000, P 0.01 . The results suggest that 19p has significance in asbestos-associated
  carcinogenesis and that asbestos may be capable of inducing specific chromosome
  aberrations.
