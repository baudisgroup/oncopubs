abstract: The epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR gene status including tyrosine
  kinase domain somatic mutations, increased copy number, and protein overexpression
  are reported to be associated with response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in
  patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to elucidate
  the prevalence of activated EGFR gene and the association between mutation, copy
  number, and protein overexpression.
