abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify genome-wide single
  nucleotide variants and mutations in African American patients with colorectal cancer
  CRC . There is a need of such studies in African Americans, because they display
  a higher incidence of aggressive CRC tumors. METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing
  WES on DNA from 12 normal tumor pairs of African American CRC patient tissues. Data
  analysis was performed using the software package GATK Genome Analysis Tool Kit
  . Normative population databases eg, 1000 Genomes SNP database, dbSNP, and HapMap
  were used for comparison. Variants were annotated using analysis of variance and
  were validated via Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We identified somatic mutations in
  genes that are known targets in CRC such as APC, BRAF, KRAS, and PIK3CA. We detected
  novel alterations in the Wnt pathway gene, APC, within its exon 15, of which mutations
  are highly associated with CRC. CONCLUSIONS: This WES study in African American
  patients with CRC provides insight into the identification of novel somatic mutations
  in APC. Our data suggest an association between specific mutations in the Wnt signaling
  pathway and an increased risk of CRC. The analysis of the pathogenicity of these
  novel variants may shed light on the aggressive nature of CRC in African Americans.
