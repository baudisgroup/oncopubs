abstract: Mutation of both alleles of the retinoblastoma gene RB1 initiate oncogenesis
  in developing human retina, but other common genomic alterations are present in
  the tumors. In order to sublocalize the altered genomic regions, 50 retinoblastoma
  tumors were examined by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The minimal regions
  most frequent gained were 1q31 52 , 6p22 44 , 2p24-p25 30 and 13q32-q34 12 . The
  minimal region most frequently lost was 16q22 14 . The overall total number of gains
  or losses evident on CGH was significantly greater in those tumors with either or
  both 6p or 1q gain, than in tumors with neither 6p nor 1q gain suggesting that chromosomal
  instability may be associated with acquisition of these changes. Genes mapping to
  6p22 and 1q31 may be important in tumor development in retina subsequent to the
  loss of RB1 alleles.
