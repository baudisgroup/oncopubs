abstract: Accumulated understanding of the molecular networks in the state of oncogene
  addiction, i.e., the amp quot Achilles heel of cancer, amp quot has led to the development
  of novel targeted therapies. Using genome-wide gene expression and network analysis,
  we have identified amp quot Aurora kinase B amp quot as a unique molecule to predict
  the lethal recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC even after curative hepatectomy.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH -array analysis revealed the genomic instability
  was closely related to Aurora kinase B expression in HCC. Then, we analyzed the
  in vitro and in vivo effects of a selective inhibitor of Aurora kinase B on human
  HCC cells. Treatment with Aurora B inhibitor in vitro resulted in polyploidy and
  apoptotic cell death. The growth of orthotopic liver tumors was significantly suppressed
  by the Aurora B inhibitor. Our preclinical studies indicate that Aurora kinase B
  is a promising molecular target amp quot Achilles heel amp quot for the treatment
  of aggressive HCC.
