abstract: Neurofibromatosis Type I NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized
  by the development of both benign and malignant tumors. The lifetime risk for developing
  a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor MPNST in NF1 patients is approximately
  10 with poor survival rates. To date, the molecular basis of MPNST development remains
  unclear. Here, we report the first genome-wide and high-resolution analysis of DNA
  copy number alterations in MPNST using the 32K bacterial artificial chromosome microarray
  on a series of 24 MPNSTs and three neurofibroma samples. In the benign neurofibromas,
  apart from loss of one copy of the NF1 gene and copy number polymorphisms, no other
  changes were found. The profiles of malignant samples, however, revealed specific
  loss of chromosomal regions including 1p35-33, 1p21, 9p21.3, 10q25, 11q22-23, 17q11,
  and 20p12.2 as well as gain of 1q25, 3p26, 3q13, 5p12, 5q11.2-q14, 5q21-23, 5q31-33,
  6p23-p21, 6p12, 6q15, 6q23-q24, 7p22, 7p14-p13, 7q21, 7q36, 8q22-q24, 14q22, and
  17q21-q25. Copy number gains were more frequent than deletions in the MPNST samples
  62 vs. 38 . The genes resident within common regions of gain were NEDL1 7p14 , AP3B1
  5q14.1 , and CUL1 7q36.1 and these were identified in amp gt 63 MPNSTs. The most
  frequently deleted locus encompassed CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP genes on 9p21.3 33
  cases . These genes have previously been implicated in other cancer conditions and
  therefore, should be considered for their therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic
  relevance in NF1 tumorigenesis.
