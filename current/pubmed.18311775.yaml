abstract: 'In vivo response to initial therapy, as assessed by determination of minimal
  residual disease MRD after 5 and 12 weeks of treatment, has evolved as a strong
  prognostic factor in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL treated according
  to the BFM regime. Individual treatment response may be influenced by copy number
  alterations CNA leading to altered gene expression. We aimed to evaluate CNA using
  high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH in different treatment-response
  groups. Leukemic genomic profiles of 25 standard risk MRD-SR and 25 high risk MRD-HR
  patients were compared. CNAs were found in 46 50 patients 92 . The most significant
  difference was a gain of 1q23-qter because of an unbalanced t 1 19 , found in 10
  25 MRD-SR patients, but in none of the MRD-HR patients P amp lt 0.001 . The most
  frequent CNAs in the MRD-HR group were deletions of genomic regions harboring the
  immunoglobulin genes Ig , e.g., 2p11.2 in 60 of MRD-HR compared to 28 of MRD-SR
  P 0.045 . Combining all Ig loci, significantly more MRD-HR than MRD-SR patients
  displayed deletions 17:8 patients, P 0.02 . Frequency of other CNAs, such as loss
  of 9p21 or gains of 21q, did not differ strongly between the two patient groups.
  This is the first study evaluating the clinical significance of CNA as detected
  by array-CGH in childhood ALL and the first to suggest that such analyses may provide
  clinically important data. This article contains supplementary material available
