abstract: The present study was aimed at discovering DNA copy number alterations (CNAs)
  involved in the carcinogenesis of stomach and at understanding their clinicopathological
  significances in the Korean population. DNA copy numbers were analyzed using Agilent
  244K or 400K array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in fresh-frozen tumor
  and matched normal tissues from 40 gastric cancer patients. Some of the detected
  CNA regions were validated using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
  (MLPA) in six of the 40 patients and customized Agilent 60K aCGH in an independent
  set of 48 gastric cancers. The mRNA levels of genes at common CNA regions were analyzed
  using quantitative real-time PCR. Copy number gains were more common than losses
  across the entire genome in tumor tissues compared to matched normal tissues. The
  mean number of alterations per case was 64 for gains and 40 for losses, and the
  median aberration length was 44016 bp for gains and 4732 bp for losses. Copy number
  gains were frequently detected at 7p22.1 (20%), 8q24.21 (27%-30%), 8q24.3 (22%-48%),
  13q34 (20%-31%), and 20q11-q13 (25%-30%), and losses at 3p14.2 (43%), 4q35.2 (27%),
  6q26 (23%), and 17p13.3 (20%-23%). CNAs at 7p22.1, 13q34, and 17p13.3 have not been
  reported in other populations. Most of the copy number losses were associated with
  down-regulation of mRNA levels, but the correlation between copy number gains and
  mRNA expression levels varied in a gene-dependent manner. In addition, copy number
  gains tended to occur more commonly in intestinal-type cancers than in diffuse-type
  cancers. In conclusion, the present study suggests that copy number gains at 8q24
  and 20q11-q13 and losses at 3p14.2 may be common events in gastric cancer but CNAs
  at 7p22.1, 13q34, and 17p13.3 may be Korean-specific.
