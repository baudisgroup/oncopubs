abstract: Xenografts from four metastatic renal cell carcinomas RCCs were established
  in immunodeficient mice. All tumors exhibited cytogenetic features specific for
  the papillary subtype, namely, partial or total polysomy of chromosomes 7 and 17
  and integrity of 3p. Cytogenetic analysis of the initial and xenografted tumors
  indicated that although clonal characteristics were consistently maintained in xenografts
  derived from metastases, a minor clone had been selected for in the xenografts derived
  from the primary tumors. Reverse painting and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH allowed us to localize minimal overrepresented genomic regions to 7q31, where
  the MET protooncogene is located, and to 17q. Other overrepresented regions were
  8q in all xenografts and Xq22-qter in three of them. The gain of genetic material
  from these regions may be a key factor ensuring the papillary nature of RCCs and
  their survival in xenografts.
