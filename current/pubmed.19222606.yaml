abstract: Breast cancer is a widespread disease in Japan and across the world. Breast
  cancer cells, as well as most other types of cancer cells, have diverse chromosomal
  aberrations. Clarifying the character of these chromosomal aberrations should contribute
  to the development of more suitable therapies, along with the predictions of metastasis
  and prognosis. Twenty-four breast cancer cell lines were analyzed by bacterial artificial
  chromosome BAC array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The array slide contained
  duplicate spots of 4030 BAC clone DNAs covering the entire human genome with 1 Mbp
  resolution. In all 24 breast cancer cell lines, frequent and significant amplifications
  as well as deletions were detected by BAC array CGH. Common DNA copy number gains,
  detected in 60 above 15 cell lines of the 24 breast cancer cell lines were found
  in 76 BAC clones, located at 1q, 5p, 8q, 9p, 16p, 17q, and 20q. Moreover, common
  DNA copy number loss was detected in 136 BAC clones, located at 1q, 2q, 3p, 4p,
  6q, 8p, 9p, 11p, 13q, 17p, 18q, 19p, Xp, and Xq. The DNA copy number abnormalities
  found included abnormality of the well-known oncogene cMYC 8q24.21 however, most
  of them were not reported to relate to breast cancer. BAC array CGH has great potential
  to detect DNA copy number abnormalities, and has revealed that breast cancer cell
  lines have substantial heterogeneity.
