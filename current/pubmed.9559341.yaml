abstract: We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to screen for DNA copy number
  changes in 34 specimens from 27 cases of mantle cell lymphoma MCL . The most common
  gains were detected at 3q 52 , 8q 30 , and 15q 26 , whereas the most frequent losses
  involved 13q 41 , 1p 33 , 6q 30 , 9p 30 , and 11q 30 . The gain of 3q, with a minimal
  common region at 3q26.1-27, appeared in more than half of the lymphomas, suggesting
  the location of an important oncogene here. A common deleted region at 11q22 was
  found in one-third of the patients, which suggests that this region may harbor a
  tumor suppressor gene important in the tumorigenesis of MCL. The mean number of
  changes was higher in more aggressive blastoid variants of MCL than in lymphomas
  with typical morphology. Our results show that the chromosomal regions affected
  in MCL are highly consistent and are different from those seen in other types of
  non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
