abstract: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive
  malignancy derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We analyzed
  21 cases with array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Complete or
  partial chromosomal losses largely outnumbered the gains, with common deleted regions
  involving 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B), 13q13.1-q14.3 (RB1), 12p13.2-p13.1 (CDKN1B), 13q11-q12
  (LATS2), and 7p12.2 (IKZF1) regions. CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion was confirmed by FISH.
  This scenario argues for disruption of cell cycle at G(1)/S transition, representing
  a genetic landmark of BPDCN, and possibly contributing to its pathogenesis. Statistical
  analysis of overall survival in our series highlighted an association of poor outcome
  with biallelic loss of locus 9p21.3. We suggest that, in the absence of reliable
  parameters for predicting prognosis in BPDCN other than age, tumor stage, and/or
  clinical presentation, simple methods, such as FISH for CDKN2A/CDKN2B, could help
  to identify the most aggressive cases.
