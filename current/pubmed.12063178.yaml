abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC is a common cancer in Southeast Asia, especially
  in southern China. One of the most striking features of this disease is its close
  relationship with Epstein-Barr Virus EBV . However, to date there is no direct study
  on the mechanisms involved in the role of EBV in the tumorigenesis of NPC, largely
  due to lack of an experimental model. Available hypotheses on the association between
  EBV and NPC are generated from non-nasopharyngeal epithelial cell systems such as
  human keratinocytes or mouse epithelial cells, which may not truly represent the
  biological properties of nasopharyngeal epithelial NP cells. In this study, we report
  the establishment of two immortalized NP cell lines, NP69SV40T and NP39E6 E7, using
  SV40T and HPV16E6 E7 oncogenes. We found that NP60SV40T and NP39E6 E7 cell lines
  not only maintained many characteristics of normal NP cells i.e. keratin profile
  and responsive to TGFbeta inhibition but also highly responsive to one of the EBV
  encoded genes, LMP1. Comparative genome hybridization CGH analysis showed that these
  two cell lines contained multiple genetic alterations, some of which have been described
  in NPC. The immortalized NP cell lines are non-tumorigenic and exhibit anchorage-dependent
  growth. These cell lines may provide a possible cell model system for studying the
  mechanisms involved in the tumorigenesis of NPC.
