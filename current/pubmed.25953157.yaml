abstract: 'HER3 activating mutations have been shown in preclinical models to be oncogenic
  and ligand-independent, but to depend on kinase-active HER2.  Whole exome sequencing
  of the primary HER2-negative breast cancer and its HER2-negative synchronous liver
  metastasis from a 46-year-old female revealed the presence of an activating and
  clonal HER3 G284R mutation.  HER2 dual blockade with trastuzumab and lapatinib as
  third-line therapy led to complete metabolic response in 2 weeks and confirmed radiological
  partial response after 8 weeks. Following the resection of the liver metastasis,
  the patient remains disease-free 40 weeks after initiation of the HER2 dual blockade
  therapy. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a substantial reduction of phospho-rpS6
  and phospho-AKT in the post-therapy biopsy of the liver metastasis.  This is the
  first-in-man evidence that anti-HER2 therapies are likely effective in breast cancers
  harboring HER3 activating mutations.  ï¿½ The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University
