abstract: Very little is known about the chromosomal regions harbouring genes involved
  in initiation and progression of BRCAX-associated breast cancers. We applied comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to identify the most frequent genomic imbalances in 18
  BRCAX hereditary breast cancers and compared them to chromosomal aberrations detected
  in a group of 27 sporadic breast cancers. The aberrations observed most frequently
  in BRCAX tumours were gains of 8q 83 , 19q 67 , 19p 61 , 20q 61 , 1q 56 , 17q 56
  and losses of 8p 56 , 11q 44 and 13q 33 . The sporadic cases most frequently showed
  gains of 1q 67 , 8q 48 , 17q 37 , 16p 33 , 19q 33 and losses of 11q 26 , 8p 22 and
  16q 19 . Losses of 8p and gains 8q, 19 as well as gains of 20q with respect to ductal
  tumours only were detected significantly more often in BRCAX than in sporadic breast
  cancers. Analysis of 8p-losses and 8q-gains showed that these aberrations are early
  events in the tumorigenesis of BRCAX tumors. The findings of this report indicate
  similarities between BRCAX and BRCA2 tumours, possibly suggesting a common pathway
  of disease. These findings need confirmation by more extensive studies because only
  a limited number of cases were analysed and there are relatively few reports published.
