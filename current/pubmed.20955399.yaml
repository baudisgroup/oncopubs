abstract: JMML and CMML are rare myelodysplastic myeloproliferative neoplasms occurring
  at both ends of life. To investigate relationships between JMML and CMML, genes
  recently involved in CMML were studied in 68 JMML patients. Mutations in TET2, RUNX1
  and JAK2 V617F are involved in myelodysplastic and or myeloproliferative syndromes,
  and more specifically in CMML but were not found in JMML. Pangenomic analysis by
  SNP-array showed no abnormality at these loci. Three frameshift mutations of ASXL1
  leading to a truncated protein were found in three patients 4 with late onset JMML
  displaying also RAS activating mutations. Homozygous mutations of CBL with 11q loss
  of heterozygosity were found in five 7 JMML. CBL substitutions were different from
  those reported in CMML, exclusive from other RAS activating mutations, and were
  germline in all patients. Overall, the pattern of genetic lesions observed in JMML
  differed from that of CMML. Although signalling deregulation is involved in CMML,
  transcriptional deregulation seems to play a pivotal role, with mutation of RUNX1,
  ASXL1 or TET2. Conversely, none of these genes involved in transcription or chromatin
  remodelling was found to be significantly altered in JMML, while CBL mutations confirm
  the central role of RAS and growth factor signalling deregulation in JMML.
