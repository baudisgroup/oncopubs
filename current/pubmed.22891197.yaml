abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Mucinous tumors are the second most common form of epithelial
  ovarian tumor, yet the cell of origin for this histologic subtype remains undetermined.
  Although these tumors are thought to arise through a stepwise progression from benign
  cystadenoma to borderline tumor to invasive carcinoma, few studies have attempted
  to comprehensively characterize the genetic changes specific to this subtype or
  its precursors. METHODS: To explore the spectrum of genomic alterations common to
  mucinous tumors we carried out high-resolution genome-wide copy number analysis,
  mutation screening by Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry on a series of
  primary ovarian mucinous cystadenomas n 20 and borderline tumors n 22 . RESULTS:
  Integration of copy number data, targeted mutation screening of RAS RAF pathway
  members and immunohistochemistry reveals that p16 loss and RAS RAF pathway alterations
  are highly recurrent events that occur early during mucinous tumor development.
  The frequency of concurrence of these events was observed in 40 of benign cystadenomas
  and 68 of borderline tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest and highest
  resolution analysis of mucinous benign and borderline tumors carried out to date
  and provides strong support for these lesions being precursors of primary ovarian
  mucinous adenocarcinoma. The high level of uniformity in the molecular events underlying
  the pathogenesis of mucinous ovarian tumors provides an opportunity for treatments
  targeting specific mutations and pathways.'
