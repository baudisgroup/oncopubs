abstract: Structural chromosomal aberrations are common in epithelial tumors. Here,
  we compared the location of centromeric breaks associated with whole arm translocations
  in seven adenocarcinoma cell lines and nine squamous cell carcinoma cell lines using
  SKY, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH . Whole arm translocations were more frequent in squamous
  cell carcinomas 112 in nine cell lines and nine in one short-term culture than in
  adenocarcinomas 13 in seven cases and most often resulted in copy number alterations.
  Array CGH analysis demonstrated that in all squamous cell carcinomas and in most
  adenocarcinomas, the breakpoints of unbalanced whole arm translocations occurred
  between the two clones on the array flanking the centromeres. However, FISH with
  centromeric probes revealed that in squamous cell carcinomas, the marker chromosomes
  with whole arm translocations contained centromeres comprised of material from both
  participating chromosomes, while in adenocarcinomas centromeric material from only
  one of the chromosomes was present. These observations suggest that different mechanisms
  of centromeric instability underlie the formation of chromosomal aberrations in
  adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.
