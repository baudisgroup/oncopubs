abstract: Cell lines are commonly used in various kinds of biomedical research in
  the world. However, it remains uncertain whether genomic alterations existing in
  primary tumor tissues are represented in cell lines and whether cell lines carry
  cell line-specific genomic alterations. This study was performed to answer these
  questions.
