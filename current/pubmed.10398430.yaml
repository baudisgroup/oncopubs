abstract: Peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise either sporadically or in association
  with neurofibromatosis type 1 von Recklinghausens neurofibromatosis, NF1 or type
  2. In this study, comprehensive screening for relative chromosome copy number changes
  was performed on 10 benign and 19 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNSTs
  by applying comparative genomic hybridization CGH . In benign tumors, no chromosomal
  imbalances were found by CGH, whereas in MPNSTs chromosomal gains and losses were
  frequently detected. No differences regarding the frequency and distribution of
  chromosomal imbalances were observed between the 13 sporadic and 6 NF1-associated
  MPNSTs analyzed. In both, the number of gains was significantly higher than the
  number of losses, suggesting a predominant role of proto-oncogene activation during
  MPNST progression. Candidate regions with potentially relevant proto-oncogenes included
  chromosomal bands 17q24-q25, 7p11-p13, 5p15, 8q22-q24, and 12q21-q24 those with
  putative tumor suppressor genes were 9p21-p24, 13q14-q22, and 1p. High-level amplifications
  were restricted to sporadic tumors and affected eight different chromosomal subregions.
  In three of these MPNSTs, identical subregions on chromosomal arms 5p and 12q were
  coamplified. This study revealed a number of new characteristic chromosomal imbalances
  and provides a basis for molecular identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes of pathogenetic relevance in both sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs. Genes
