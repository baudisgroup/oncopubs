abstract: Although genetic aspects of tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer CRC have
  been well studied, reliable biomarkers predicting prognosis are scarce. We aimed
  to identify recurrently altered genomic regions RAR in CRC with high resolution,
  to investigate their implications on survival and to explore novel cancer-related
  genes in prognosis-associated RARs.
