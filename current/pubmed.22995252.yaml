abstract: 'The concept of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in colorectal
  cancer (CRC) is widely accepted, although the timing of its occurrence and its interaction
  with other genetic defects are not fully understood. Our aim in this study was to
  unravel the molecular development of CIMP cancers by dissecting their genetic and
  epigenetic signatures in precancerous and malignant colorectal lesions. We characterized
  the methylation profile and BRAF/KRAS mutation status in 368 colorectal tissue samples,
  including precancerous and malignant lesions. In addition, genome-wide copy number
  aberrations, methylation profiles, and mutations of BRAF, KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA
  pathway genes were examined in 84 colorectal lesions. Genome-wide methylation analysis
  of CpG islands and selected marker genes revealed that CRC precursor lesions are
  in three methylation subgroups: CIMP-high, CIMP-low, and CIMP-negative. Interestingly,
  a subset of CIMP-positive malignant lesions exhibited frequent copy number gains
  on chromosomes 7 and 19 and genetic defects in the AKT/PIK3CA pathway genes. Analysis
  of mixed lesions containing both precancerous and malignant components revealed
  that most aberrant methylation is acquired at the precursor stage, whereas copy
  number aberrations are acquired during the progression from precursor to malignant
  lesion. Our integrative genomic and epigenetic analysis suggests early onset of
  CIMP during CRC development and indicates a previously unknown CRC development pathway
  in which epigenetic instability associates with genomic alterations.'
