abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs with neurogenic differentiation, also
  referred to as amp quot gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumors GANTs , amp quot
  form an ultrastructurally distinctive subgroup of mesenchymal neoplasms of gastrointestinal
  tract. Cytogenetic and molecular data of these tumors are limited. In the current
  study, c-KIT gene sequenc-ing analysis, comparative genomic hybridization CGH ,
  and interphase fluorescence in situ hybrid- ization FISH analysis, utilizing chromosome
  14- and 22-specific probes, were performed on five primary ultrastructurally confirmed
  GANTs. FISH and CGH analysis revealed loss of a whole or part of chromosome 14q
  in two tumors and of chromo- some 22q, with the common overlapping area of loss
  at q13, in all five tumors evaluated. c-KIT mu- tations were found in all cases
  three tumors carried point mutation and or deletions of exon 11, and in two tumors,
  insertion in exon 9 was found. These findings suggest that accumulated genetic changes
  contribute to the pathogenesis of GANTs and that 22q13 loss may be a characteristic
  feature of these tumors.
