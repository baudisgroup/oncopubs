abstract: AZD1152 is a highly selective Aurora B kinase inhibitor currently undergoing
  Phase I and II clinical evaluation in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and
  advanced solid malignancies. We have established two AZD1152-resistant cell lines
  from SW620 colon and MiaPaCa pancreatic carcinoma lines, which are amp gt 100-fold
  resistant to the active metabolite of AZD1152, AZD1152 HQPA and interestingly, cross-resistant
  to the pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, VX-680 MK0457. Using whole-genome microarray
  analysis and comparative genomic hybridization, we were able to identify MDR1 and
  BCRP as the causative genes that underlie AZD1152 HQPA-resistance in these models.
  Furthermore, the upregulation of either of these genes is sufficient to render in
  vivo tumor growth insensitive to AZD1152. Finally, the upregulation of MDR1 or BCRP
  is predictive of tumor cell sensitivity to this agent, both in vitro and in vivo.
  The data provide a genetic basis for resistance to Aurora kinase inhibitors, which
  could be utilized to predict clinical response to therapy.
