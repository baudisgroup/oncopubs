abstract: 'Chromosomal analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is often difficult
  because of the suboptimal in vitro growth of the immature lymphoid cell and the
  poor morphology obtained. In this study, we describe the application of comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to investigate the genomic abnormalities in 14 patients
  with ALL, all of whom had cytogenetically identified numerical aberrations or gross
  chromosomal structural alteration. With the use of CGH, regional or whole chromosome
  overrepresentation or both were found to be more frequent than underrepresentation
  52 gains vs. 6 losses , the most common gains being chromosomes 21 and X. The results
  of the comparison between CGH and conventional R-banding analysis could be classified
  into three categories: 1 in three cases, including two with trisomy, CGH and banding
  analysis gave identical results 2 in six cases with hyperdiploidy and two cases
  presenting chromosome structural abnormalities, the results were consistent but
  with minor discrepancies 3 in three cases, including two with triploidy and tetraploidy
  and one with chimeric karyotype together with 22, the data from CGH and cytogenetical
  analysis were discrepant. CGH could not find the triploidy and tetraploidy. Our
  results suggest that CGH has certain value in the detection of gains or losses of
  chromosome materials in hyperdiploid ALL. Nevertheless, the combination of CGH and
  conventional karyotyping provides more precise information on the genomic imbalance
  in ALL.'
