abstract: Neuroblastoma is an aggressive embryonal tumor that accounts for 15 of childhood
  cancer deaths. Hitherto, despite the availability of comprehensive genomic data
  on DNA copy number changes in neuroblastoma, relatively little is known about the
  genes driving neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. In this study, high resolution array
  comparative genome hybridization CGH was performed on 188 primary neuroblastoma
  tumors and 33 neuroblastoma cell lines to search for previously undetected recurrent
  DNA copy number gains and losses. A new recurrent distal chromosome 1q deletion
  del 1 q42.2qter was detected in seven cases. Further analysis of available array
  CGH datasets revealed 13 additional similar distal 1q deletions. The majority of
  all detected 1q deletions was found in high risk 11q deleted tumors without MYCN
  amplification Fisher exact test p 5.61 10 -5 . Using ultra-high resolution  115
  bp resolution custom arrays covering the breakpoints on 1q for 11 samples, clustering
  of nine breakpoints was observed within a 12.5-kb region, of which eight were found
  in a 7-kb copy number variable region, whereas the remaining two breakpoints were
  colocated 1.4-Mb proximal. The commonly deleted region contains one miRNA hsa-mir-1537
  , four transcribed ultra conserved region elements uc.43-uc.46 and 130 protein coding
  genes including at least two bona fide tumor suppressor genes, EGLN1 or PHD2 and
  FH. This finding further contributes to the delineation of the genomic profile of
  aggressive neuroblastoma, offers perspectives for the identification of genes contributing
  to the disease phenotype and may be relevant in the light of assessment of response
  to new molecular treatments.
