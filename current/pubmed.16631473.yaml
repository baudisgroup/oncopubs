abstract: Adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction GEJ show frequent high-level
  amplifications HLA , but the underlying genes are not well defined. We have characterized
  genomic gain in 14 GEJ carcinomas by array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH . The most frequent gains and amplifications were detected at 7q 57 , 8q 57
  , 17q 64 , and 20q 79 , with minimally amplified regions at 7q21.1, 8q24.2, 17q12,
  and 20q13.2. Five HLA were detected on 7q, one on 8q, two on 17q, and three on 20q.
  HLA of 8q24 and 17q12 were related to MYC and ERBB2, respectively. The HLA on 7q21
  was associated recurrently with ABCB1, whereas the amplified region on 20q13 implicated
  ZNF217, BCAS1, and CYP24. RNA expression analysis of 11 adenocarcinomas by reverse-transcription
  polymerase chain reaction was performed for cancer-related genes residing at 7q21
  ABCB1, ABCB4, CDK6, HGF, DMTF1, SRI, TP53AP1 and 20q13 ZNF217, BCAS1, CYP24, TNFRSF6B
  . The most frequently upregulated gene on 7q21 was HGF 45 , but there was no association
  with genomic amplification. The most frequently overexpressed gene at 20q13 was
  BCAS1 27 , which was related to HLA of this region P 0.006 in all three cases. We
  conclude that HLA occur often in GEJ adenocarcinomas. The gene responsible for the
  HLA of 7q21 requires further investigation, whereas BCAS1 is a good candidate for
  the frequent amplification of 20q13.
