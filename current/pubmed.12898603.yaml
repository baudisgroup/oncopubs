abstract: Primary orbital non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
  MALT -type extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Little information is available on
  its genome as conventional cytogenetics is limited by scarce biopsy material, while
  fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH explores only selected regions. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH performs full genomic analysis and is applicable to different
  sources of DNA, such as fresh and frozen cells, as well as paraffin-embedded tissues.
  In this study, CGH was used to analyse primary MALT lymphoma of the orbit. Aneuploidy
  was identified in six of the ten cases studied. Gains 19 were more frequent than
  losses 5 . The most frequent duplications involved chromosome 3 common region at
  3q24-qter , as expected in marginal zone lymphoma, and chromosome 6 common region
  at 6p21.1-21.3 , which is typical of an orbital location. Other chromosome gains
  were found at 1p, 7, 8q, 9q, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 22, and X. Losses were located
  at 1q, 6q, 9q, 11q, and 13q. Two cases showed isolated duplications of chromosome
  6p or 9q. Isolated imbalances were found only in tumours affecting the conjunctiva.
  Complex aneuploidies were observed in lymphoma of the retro-orbital tissue. In summary,
  CGH in orbital MALT lymphoma provided new insights into typical genomic imbalances
  and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.
