abstract: Childhood neuroblastoma, an embryonal neoplasm of sympathetic nervous system
  progenitors, occurs in a familial form with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
  Genetic susceptibility to this disorder is thought to arise via a germline mutation
  affecting a tumor suppressor gene, in accord with the two-hit model established
  for familial and sporadic retinoblastoma. Surprisingly, the familial neuroblastoma
  predisposition locus does not map to chromosome band 1p36, a genomic region likely
  to contain one or more neuroblastoma suppressor genes. We reasoned that inherited
  point mutations affecting one allele would be unmasked in many cases by somatically
  acquired deletions of the second allele that included the target gene in the tumor
  cells from these patients. Thus, to identify chromosomal regions that might contain
  suppressor genes important in hereditary neuroblastoma, we analyzed six familial
  tumors by comparative genomic hybridization. Recurrent losses of genetic material
  were detected on chromosome arms 3p consensus region, 3p24-pter , 10p consensus,
  10p12-p13 , 10q consensus, 10q25-qter , 16q consensus, 16q12-q22 , and 20q consensus,
  20q13.3-qter , in addition to the regions commonly deleted in sporadic neuroblastomas
  1p36 and 11q . These chromosomal sites may harbor novel tumor suppressor genes that
  could aid in our understanding of the predisposition to and pathogenesis of familial
  neuroblastoma and potentially sporadic tumors as well.
