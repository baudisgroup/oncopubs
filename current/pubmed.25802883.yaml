abstract: Matching molecularly targeted therapies with cancer subtype-specific gene
  mutations is revolutionizing oncology care. However, for rare cancers this approach
  is problematic due to the often poor understanding of the disease's natural history
  and phenotypic heterogeneity, making treatment of these cancers a particularly unmet
  medical need in clinical oncology. Advanced Sezary syndrome (SS), an aggressive,
  exceedingly rare variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a prototypical example
  of a rare cancer. Through whole genome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of a SS patient's
  tumor we discovered a highly expressed gene fusion between CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte
  antigen 4) and CD28 (cluster of differentiation 28), predicting a novel stimulatory
  molecule on the surface of tumor T cells. Treatment with the CTLA4 inhibitor ipilimumab
  resulted in a rapid clinical response. Our findings suggest a novel driver mechanism
  for SS, and cancer in general, and exemplify an emerging model of cancer treatment
  using exploratory genomic analysis to identify a personally targeted treatment option
  when conventional therapies are exhausted.
