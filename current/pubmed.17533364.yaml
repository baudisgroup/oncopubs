abstract: Identifying genes, whose expression is consistently altered by chromosomal
  gains or losses, is an important step in defining genes of biological relevance
  in a wide variety of tumour types. However, additional criteria are needed to discriminate
  further among the large number of candidate genes identified. This is particularly
  true for neuroblastoma, where multiple genomic copy number changes of proven prognostic
  value exist. We have used Affymetrix microarrays and a combination of fluorescent
  in situ hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism SNP microarrays to establish
  expression profiles and delineate copy number alterations in 30 primary neuroblastomas.
  Correlation of microarray data with patient survival and analysis of expression
  within rodent neuroblastoma cell lines were then used to define further genes likely
  to be involved in the disease process. Using this approach, we identify amp gt 1000
  genes within eight recurrent genomic alterations loss of 1p, 3p, 4p, 10q and 11q,
  2p gain, 17q gain, and the MYCN amplicon whose expression is consistently altered
  by copy number change. Of these, 84 correlate with patient survival, with the minimal
  regions of 17q gain and 4p loss being enriched significantly for such genes. These
  include genes involved in RNA and DNA metabolism, and apoptosis. Orthologues of
  all but one of these genes on 17q are overexpressed in rodent neuroblastoma cell
  lines. A significant excess of SNPs whose copy number correlates with survival is
  also observed on proximal 4p in stage 4 tumours, and we find that deletion of 4p
  is associated with improved outcome in an extended cohort of tumours. These results
  define the major impact of genomic copy number alterations upon transcription within
  neuroblastoma, and highlight genes on distal 17q and proximal 4p for downstream
  analyses. They also suggest that integration of discriminators, such as survival
  and comparative gene expression, with microarray data may be useful in the identification
  of critical genes within regions of loss or gain in many human cancers.
