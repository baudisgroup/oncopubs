abstract: 'We analyzed DNA sequence copy number aberrations DSCNAs in 17 primary oral
  squamous cell carcinomas OSCCs by comparative genomic hybridization. DSCNAs were
  detected frequently at 3q25-qter 7 17 , Xp21 5 17 , and Xq12-q23 and 8q23-q24 4
  17 , and losses were detected frequently at 13q21-q22 5 17 , 3p21-pter, 4p15-pter
  and 17p13 4 17 , and 8p22-pter and 9p21-pter 3 17 . Four tumors showed amplifications
  of seven loci: 3q11-qter, 3q13, 3q26, 7q21-q22, 8q23-qter, 9p22-pter, and 12p11.
  The total number of DSCNAs was significantly greater in stage III and stage IV tumors
  than in stage I and stage II tumors P .008 . Furthermore, 3q gain was detected preferentially
  in stage III and stage IV tumors 6 8 rather than in stage I and stage II tumors
  1 9, P .013 . In our study, all tumors with gain of 3q also contained one or more
  loss es in common regions. On the other hand, all tumors with gain of 9p did not
  contain 3q gains. These observations indicate that gain of 3q and accumulation of
  DSCNAs are strongly associated with tumor progression in OSCC. Furthermore, 3q gain
  and loss of one or more additional loci in common aberration regions appears to
  be a group of DSCNs associated with dominant genetic pathways of leading to advanced
  OSCCs.'
