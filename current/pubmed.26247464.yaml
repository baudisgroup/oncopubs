abstract: Oral squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx (OSCC) is associated
  with high case-fatality. For reasons that are largely unknown, patients with the
  same clinical and pathologic staging have heterogeneous response to treatment and
  different probability of recurrence and survival, with patients with Human Papillomavirus
  (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal tumors having the most favorable survival. To gain
  insight into the complexity of OSCC and to identify potential chromosomal changes
  that may be associated with OSCC mortality, we used Affymtrix 6.0 SNP arrays to
  examine paired DNA from peripheral blood and tumor cell populations isolated by
  laser capture microdissection to assess genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
  and DNA copy number aberration (CNA) and their associations with risk factors, tumor
  characteristics, and oral cancer-specific mortality among 75 patients with HPV-negative
  OSCC. We found a highly heterogeneous and complex genomic landscape of HPV-negative
  tumors, and identified regions in 4q, 8p, 9p and 11q that seem to play an important
  role in oral cancer biology and survival from this disease. If confirmed, these
  findings could assist in designing personalized treatment or in the creation of
  models to predict survival in patients with HPV-negative OSCC.
