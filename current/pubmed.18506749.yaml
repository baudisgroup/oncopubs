abstract: 'The acquisition of uniparental disomy aUPD in acute myeloid leukemia AML
  results in homozygosity for known gene mutations. Uncovering novel regions of aUPD
  has the potential to identify previously unknown mutational targets. We therefore
  aimed to develop a map of the regions of aUPD in AML. Here, we have analyzed a large
  set of diagnostic AML samples n 454 from young adults age: 15-55 years using genotype
  arrays. Acquired UPD was found in 17 of the samples with a nonrandom distribution
  particularly affecting chromosome arms 13q, 11p, and 11q. Novel recurrent regions
  of aUPD were uncovered at 2p, 17p, 2q, 17q, 1p, and Xq. Overall, aUPDs were observed
  across all cytogenetic risk groups, although samples with aUPD13q 5.4 of samples
  belonged exclusively to the intermediate-risk group as defined by cytogenetics.
  All cases with a high FLT3-ITD level, measured previously, had aUPD13q covering
  the FLT3 gene. Significantly, none of the samples with FLT3-ITD - FLT3-TKD mutation
  exhibited aUPD13q. Of the 119 aUPDs observed, the majority 87 were due to mitotic
  recombination while only 13 were due to nondisjunction. This study demonstrates
  aUPD is a frequent and significant finding in AML and pinpoints regions that may
  contain novel mutational targets.'
