abstract: There is a clinical need for routinely available genomic biomarker testing
  in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. In the current study we performed molecular cytogenetics
  using a validated array based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH assay
  to screen for the presence of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in archival diagnostic
  tissue from ovarian cancer patients. We hypothesized that biomarkers of high-risk
  disease would be detectable in tumor samples from patients with treatment refractory,
  advanced disease, and would be detected less frequently in tumor samples from patients
  with more favorable outcomes. In addition, we predicted that the use of a genome-wide
  copy number analysis CNA testing platform would enable us to identify novel potentially
  targetable chromosomal alterations of therapeutic significance in a percentage of
  cases.
