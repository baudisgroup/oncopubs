abstract: Deletions at the long arm of chromosome 13, mostly at the q14, and monosomy
  of chromosome 13 are described to be common in multiple myeloma MM . 13q- has been
  associated with an adverse outcome and it has been proposed as one of the most important
  prognostic factors for MM patients. Deletions of 13q14 are rare in monoclonal gammopathy
  of undetermined significance MGUS and are thus believed to be associated with the
  development of the full myeloma phenotype.
