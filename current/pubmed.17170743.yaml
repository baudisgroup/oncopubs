abstract: Follicular lymphoma is commonly transformed to a more aggressive diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL . In order to provide molecular characterization of
  this histological and clinical transformation, comparative genomic hybridization
  was applied to 23 follicular lymphoma and 35 transformed DLBCL tumors from a total
  of 30 patients. The results were also compared with our published findings in de
  novo DLBCL. Copy number changes were detected in 70 of follicular lymphoma and in
  97 of transformed DLBCL. In follicular lymphoma, the most common alterations were
  18q21 33 , Xq25-26 28 , 1q31-32 23 , and -17p 23 , whereas transformed DLBCL most
  frequently exhibited Xq25-26 36 , 12q15 29 , 7pter-q22 25 , 8q21 21 , and -6q16-21
  25 . Transformed DLBCL showed significantly more alterations as compared to follicular
  lymphoma P 0.0001 , and the alterations -6q16-21 and 7pter-q22 were only found in
  transformed DLBCL but not in follicular lymphoma P 0.02 . Alterations involving
  13q22 were significantly less frequent, whereas -4q13-21 was more common in transformed
  as compared to de novo DLBCL P 0.01 and P 0.02, respectively . Clinical progression
  from follicular lymphoma to transformed DLBCL is on the genetic level associated
  with acquisition of increasing number of genomic copy number changes, with non-random
  involvement of specific target regions. The findings support diverse genetic background
  between transformed and de novo DLBCL.
