abstract: This report describes a patient with a rare huge epithelioid malignant peripheral
  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the left axilla. A male in his 70s was admitted to
  our hospital for evaluation of a growing tumor in his left axilla. The tumor was
  solid and immovable. Examination of a biopsy specimen resulted in a diagnosis of
  epithelioid MPNST. Two weeks after the biopsy was performed, the tumor grew to 20
  cm and became painful, and the patient was unable to feel pressure on his upper
  arm. Immediately before surgery to remove the tumor, computed tomography suggested
  the presence of lung metastases. The patient and his family were informed of his
  disease state, and they elected surgical treatment to ease the symptoms associated
  with tumor enlargement. Systemic metastases appeared soon after the surgery, and
  the patient died within 11 weeks. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis
  showed that this tumor was chromosomally unstable, with impairments in gene expression.
