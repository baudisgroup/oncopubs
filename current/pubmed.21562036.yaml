abstract: Only a limited number of genetic studies have been conducted in primary
  central nervous system lymphomas PCNSL , partly due to the rarity of the tumors
  and the very limited amount of available tissue. In this report, we present the
  first molecular characterization of copy number abnormalities CNA of newly diagnosed
  PCNSL by array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  FFPE specimens and compare the results with matched, frozen tumor specimens.
