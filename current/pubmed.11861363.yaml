abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH uses multiple genomic
  clones arrayed on a slide to detect relative copy number of tumor DNA sequences.
  Application of array CGH to tumor specimens makes genetic diagnosis of cancers possible
  and may help to differentiate relevant subsets of tumors, biologically and clinically,
  which would allow better prognostic and therapeutic decision making. In this study,
  we have used array-based CGH to detect DNA copy number alterations in distinct types
  of renal cell carcinomas for diagnostic purposes. We were able to correctly diagnose
  33 of 34 malignant tumors by automated computational means and to group together
  eight benign neoplasms and normal kidney samples. These results indicate that array-based
  CGH is capable of diagnosing the vast majority of renal cell carcinomas based on
  their genetic profiles.
