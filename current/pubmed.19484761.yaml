abstract: Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma ATLL is a malignant tumor caused by latent
  human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-1 infection. We previously identified a common
  breakpoint cluster region at 10p11.2 in acute-type ATLL by spectral karyotyping.
  Single nucleotide polymorphism array comparative genomic hybridization analysis
  of the breakpoint region in three ATLL-related cell lines and four patient samples
  revealed that the chromosomal breakpoints are localized within the enhancer of polycomb
  1 EPC1 gene locus in an ATLL-derived cell line SO4 and in one patient with acute-type
  ATLL. EPC1 is a human homologue of the E Pc enhancer of polycomb gene of Drosophila.
  Inappropriate expression of the polycomb group gene family has been linked to the
  loss of normal gene silencing pathways, which can contribute to the loss of cell
  identity and malignant transformation in many kinds of cancers. In the case of the
  SO4 cell line, which carried a der 10 t 2 10 p23 p11.2 translocation, EPC1 was fused
  with the additional sex combs-like 2 ASXL2 gene at 2p23.3 EPC1 ASXL2 . In the case
  with an acute-type ATLL, who carried a der 10 del 10 p11.2 del 10 q22q24 translocation,
  a putative truncated EPC1 gene EPC1tr was identified. Overexpression of EPC1 ASXL2
  enhanced cell growth in T-leukemia cells, and a GAL4-EPC1 ASXL2 fusion protein showed
  high transcriptional activity. Although a GAL4-EPC1tr fusion protein did not activate
  transcription, overexpression of EPC1tr accelerated cell growth in leukemia cells,
  suggesting that the EPC1 structural abnormalities in the SO4 cell line and in the
  patient with acute-type ATLL may contribute to leukemogenesis.
