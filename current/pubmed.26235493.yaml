abstract: "Urothelial carcinomas (UCs) may present at first as a solitary or multifocal
  neoplasm. We applied high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization to
  24 solitary and 32 multiplex UCs and used the hidden Markov model algorithm to identify
  the copy number changes at the probe level. Copy number losses and homozygous deletions
  at the chromosome 9p region affecting the CDKN2A and MTAP genes were the most frequent
  alterations in both groups of tumors. We have delineated two new tumor suppressor
  gene regions at chromosome 9p that harbor the PTPRD and BNC2 genes. Copy number
  losses at chromosomal regions 2q, 8p, and 18p occurred preferentially in solitary
  UCs, whereas multiplex UCs displayed loss of large chromosomal regions at 9q, 10q,
  11q, 18q, and 21q. Homozygous deletions harboring loci of cell adhesion genes such
  as claudins, desmocollins, and desmogleins were seen exclusively in multiplex UCs.
  Amplifications occurred only in invasive G3 UCs irrespective of staging. Our study
  suggests that solitary and multiplex UCs may have divergent genetic pathways. The
  biallelic inactivation of cellular adhesion genes by homozygous deletions in multiplex
  UCs may explain the frequent intravesical spreading of tumor cells.â\x80\x89.  Copyright
