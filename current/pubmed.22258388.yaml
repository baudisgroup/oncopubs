abstract: Frequent genetic variants may be associated with GCA. Existing studies have
  analysed a limited number of candidate genes and genetic variants. To expand this
  information, we performed a case-control study genotyping 130 single nucleotide
  polymorphisms SNPs in 82 biopsy-proven GCA patients and 166 healthy controls from
  the Spanish population.
