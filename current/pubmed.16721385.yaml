abstract: To model and investigate different facets of leukemia pathogenesis, a widely
  accepted approach is to use immortalized leukemia cell lines. Although these provide
  powerful tools to our knowledge, few studies have addressed the question whether
  hematopoietic cell lines represent accurate and reliable model systems. To improve
  the molecular characterization of these model systems, we analyzed 17 myeloid leukemia
  cell lines using DNA microarray technology. By array-based comparative genomic hybridization,
  we identified recurrent genomic DNA gains and losses, as well as high-level amplifications.
  Parallel analysis of gene expression helped delineate potential candidate genes,
  and unsupervised analysis of gene expression data revealed cell lines to cluster
  in part based on underlying cytogenetic abnormalities. Comparison with clinical
  leukemia specimens showed that key signatures were retained, as myeloid cell lines
  with characteristic cytogenetic aberrations co-clustered with leukemia samples carrying
  the respective abnormality. Signatures were also quite robust, as expression data
  from cell lines correlated highly with published data. Thus, our analyses demonstrate
  myeloid cell lines to exhibit conserved and stable signatures reflecting the underlying
  primary cytogenetic aberrations. Our refined molecular characterization of myeloid
  cell lines supports the utility of cell lines as faithful and powerful model systems
  and provides additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis.
