abstract: The overall pattern of chromosomal changes detected by spectral karyotype
  SKY analysis of two cell lines of each major histological subtype of NSCLC, namely
  squamous cell carcinoma SQCC and adenocarcinoma ADC , indicated a greater degree
  of chromosomal rearrangement, than was present or predicted by either comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH or G-banding analysis alone. To investigate these observations,
  CGH was used to screen DNA derived from 8 primary tumors and 15 cell lines. The
  results indicated that the most frequently gained chromosome arms were 5p 70 , 8q
  65 , 15q 52 , 20q 48 , 1q 43 , 19q 39 , 3q 35 , and 11q 35 . Chromosomal losses
  were less frequently observed, and included 18q 39 , 9 35 , 6q 30 , 13q 21 , 5q12-q32
  17 , and 19p 17 . Amplifications were found on 2p23-p24, 3q24-q27, 5p, 6cen-p21.1,
  6q26, 7p21, 7q31, 8q, 11q13-qter, 20q12-q13.2. Comparison between CGH findings of
  the two major histological subtypes showed that gains at 1q22-q32.2, 15q, 20q, and
  losses at 6q, 13q, and 18q was common in ADCs, whereas SQCCs exhibited gains amplifications
  at 3q. Distal 8q was gained by CGH in 65 of tumors of both subtypes. Low level MYCC
  amplification was confirmed by direct fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analysis.
  The pattern of overall chromosomal changes detected using combinations of molecular
  cytogenetic analytical methods suggests that it will be easier to detect recurrent
  subtype-dependent aberrations in NSCLC.
