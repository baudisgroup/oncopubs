abstract: So far, CRC cell lines have contributed to descriptions of 2 patterns of
  genetic instability, affecting either microsatellite sequences or chromosome number
  and structure. Often, these patterns are mutually exclusive while near-diploid karyotypes
  usually appear with MSI and chromosomal stability, near-triploid or tetraploid cells
  display a high degree of CIN and are stable at the microsatellite level. In the
  present study, we describe the genomic instability pattern of KM12 CRC cells. KM12C
  and derived cell lines with different metastatic properties were analyzed by conventional
  cytogenetics, CGH and M-FISH. Results were compared to 5 cell lines usually used
  as model of MSI and CIN. Concordance between our results and previously published
  SKY data are also reviewed. Interestingly, the poorly metastatic KM12C cell line
  displayed a near-diploid karyotype with high levels of structural chromosome instability
  and microsatellite instability. The highly metastatic KM12SM and KM12L4A cell lines
  showed polyploid karyotypes and maintained CIN and MSI. A comparison between karyotypes
  of poorly and highly metastatic KM12 cell lines allowed us to delineate a cytogenetic
  evolution pathway. Our results clearly demonstrated that endoreduplication was the
  origin of the polyploid dosages in the highly metastatic forms following the monosomic
  model postulated for CRC. Therefore, we demonstrate that KM12C cells and their metastatic
  derivates, KM12SM and KM12L4A, are a useful model of chromosomal evolution where
  MSI may coexist with CIN.
