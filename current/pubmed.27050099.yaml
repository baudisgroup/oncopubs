abstract: MYCN amplification and overexpression are common in neuroendocrine prostate
  cancer (NEPC). However, the impact of aberrant N-Myc expression in prostate tumorigenesis
  and the cellular origin of NEPC have not been established. We define N-Myc and activated
  AKT1 as oncogenic components sufficient to transform human prostate epithelial cells
  to prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC with phenotypic and molecular features of aggressive,
  late-stage human disease. We directly show that prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC
  can arise from a common epithelial clone. Further, N-Myc is required for tumor maintenance,
  and destabilization of N-Myc through Aurora A kinase inhibition reduces tumor burden.
  Our findings establish N-Myc as a driver of NEPC and a target for therapeutic intervention.
