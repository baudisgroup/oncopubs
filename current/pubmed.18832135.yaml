abstract: Mycosis fungoides MF , the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is a malignancy
  of mature, skin-homing T cells. S zary syndrome Sz is often considered to represent
  a leukemic phase of MF. In this study, the pattern of numerical chromosomal alterations
  in MF tumor samples was defined using array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH simultaneously, gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. Highly recurrent
  chromosomal alterations in MF include gain of 7q36, 7q21-7q22 and loss of 5q13 and
  9p21. The pattern characteristic of MF differs markedly from chromosomal alterations
  observed in Sz. Integration of data from array-based CGH and gene-expression analysis
  yielded several candidate genes with potential relevance in the pathogenesis of
  MF. We confirmed that the FASTK and SKAP1 genes, residing in loci with recurrent
  gain, demonstrated increased expression. The RB1 and DLEU1 tumor suppressor genes
  showed diminished expression associated with loss. In addition, it was found that
  the presence of chromosomal alterations on 9p21, 8q24, and 1q21-1q22 was associated
  with poor prognosis in patients with MF. This study provides novel insight into
  genetic alterations underlying MF. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered genomic differences
  between MF and Sz, which suggest that the molecular pathogenesis and therefore therapeutic
  requirements of these cutaneous T-cell lymphomas may be distinct.
