abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC is highly prevalent in China and
  other Asian countries, as a major cause of cancer-related mortality. ESCC displays
  complex chromosomal abnormalities, including multiple structural and numerical aberrations.
  Chromosomal abnormalities, such as recurrent amplifications and homozygous deletions,
  directly contribute to tumorigenesis through altering the expression of key oncogenes
  and tumor suppressor genes.
