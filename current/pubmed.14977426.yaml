abstract: Colorectal cancer CRC is one of the most common causes of cancer-related
  deaths in the Western world, and despite the fact that metastases are usually the
  ultimate cause of deaths, the knowledge of the genetics of advanced stages of this
  disease is limited. In order to identify potential genetic abnormalities underlying
  the development of local and distant metastases in CRC patients, we have, by comparative
  genomic hybridization, compared the DNA copy number profiles of 10 primary carcinomas,
  14 local recurrences, 7 peritoneal carcinomatoses, and 42 liver metastases from
  61 CRC patients.
