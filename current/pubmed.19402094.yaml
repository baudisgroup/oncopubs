abstract: PTEN haploinsufficiency is common in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer,
  though the incidence of genomic deletion and its downstream effects have not been
  elucidated in clinical samples of hormone refractory prostate cancer HRPC . Progression
  to androgen independence is pivotal in prostate cancer and mediated largely by the
  androgen receptor AR . Since this process is distinct from metastatic progression,
  we examined alterations of the PTEN gene in locally advanced recurrent, non-metastatic
  human HRPC tissues. Retrospective analyses of PTEN deletion status were correlated
  with activated downstream phospho-Akt p-Akt pathway proteins and with the androgen
  receptor. The prevalence of PTEN genomic deletions in transurethral resection samples
  of 59 HRPC patients with known clinical outcome was assessed by four-colour FISH
  analyses. FISH was performed using six BAC clones spanning both flanking PTEN genomic
  regions and the PTEN gene locus, and a chromosome 10 centromeric probe. PTEN copy
  number was also evaluated in a subset of cases using single nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP arrays. In addition, the samples were immunostained with antibodies against
  p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-70S6, and AR. The PTEN gene was deleted in 77 of cases, with 25
  showing homozygous deletions, 18 homozygous and hemizygous deletions, and 34 hemizygous
  deletions only. In a subset of the study group, SNP array analysis confirmed the
  FISH findings. PTEN genomic deletion was significantly correlated to the expression
  of downstream p-Akt p amp lt 0.0001 , AR p 0.025 , and to cancer-specific mortality
  p 0.039 . PTEN deletion is common in HRPC, with bi-allelic loss correlating to disease-specific
  mortality and associated with Akt and AR deregulation.
