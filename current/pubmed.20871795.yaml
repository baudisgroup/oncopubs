abstract: Neuroendocrine tumors NETs comprise a group of rare tumors derived from
  the diffuse neuroendocrine system or islet endocrine cells of the pancreas. The
  molecular mechanisms underlying NETs are largely unknown. The tumor suppressor p53
  plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and tumor prevention. The
  p53 pathway is tightly regulated by a number of proteins, among which MDM2, MDM4,
  and WIP1 are key negative regulators of p53 protein levels or activity. Aberrant
  activation of these negative regulators can attenuate the p53 function that serves
  as an important mechanism of tumorigenesis. In this study, several genetic alterations
  in pancreatic NETs were studied. These tumors exhibit various chromosomal aberrations
  throughout the whole genome as examined by array-based comparative genomic hybridization.
  Although p53 mutations are rare in NETs amp lt 3 , this study presents evidence
  that the p53 pathway is altered in pancreatic NETs through aberrant activation of
  its negative regulators. A high percentage of pancreatic NETs contain extra gene
  copies of MDM2 22 , MDM4 30 , and WIP1 51 , which are correlated with expression
  of corresponding mRNAs and proteins. In addition, there is a higher frequency 23
  v. 15 in the control population of the G G genotype of MDM2 SNP309, a functional
  single-nucleotide polymorphism in the MDM2 gene that attenuates the function of
  the p53 protein. Overall, approximately 70 of pancreatic NETs have one or more of
  these genetic changes. These findings suggest that the negative regulation of p53
  function could be an important mechanism for the initiation and or progression of
  pancreatic NETs, and reactivation of p53 could be a potential therapeutic strategy
  for patients with this disease.
