abstract: Aberrant crypt foci ACF are the earliest identifiable neoplastic lesions
  in the colon. Thirty-two ACFs were examined for genomic instability in forms detectable
  either by inter- simple sequence repeat PCR or by array comparative genomic hybridization
  array-CGH . One-fourth of ACFs revealed moderate instability by inter- simple sequence
  repeat PCR none showed amplifications or deletions on array-CGH. The absence of
  genomic events detectible by BAC array-CGH indicates early events in colorectal
  tumor progression are typically smaller than the approximate 150 kb size of a BAC
  clone insert.
