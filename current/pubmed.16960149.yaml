abstract: Integrative genomic and gene-expression analyses have identified amplified
  oncogenes in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma B-NHL , but the capability of such technologies
  to localize tumor suppressor genes within homozygous deletions remains unexplored.
  Array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH and gene-expression microarray
  analysis of 48 cell lines derived from patients with different B-NHLs delineated
  20 homozygous deletions at 7 chromosome areas, all of which contained tumor suppressor
  gene targets. Further investigation revealed that only a fraction of primary biopsies
  presented inactivation of these genes by point mutation or intragenic deletion,
  but instead some of them were frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. Notably,
  the pattern of genetic and epigenetic inactivation differed among B-NHL subtypes.
  Thus, the P53-inducible PIG7 LITAF was silenced by homozygous deletion in primary
  mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and by promoter hypermethylation in germinal center
  lymphoma, the proapoptotic BIM gene presented homozygous deletion in mantle cell
  lymphoma and promoter hypermethylation in Burkitt lymphoma, the proapoptotic BH3-only
  NOXA was mutated and preferentially silenced in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and
  INK4c P18 was silenced by biallelic mutation in mantle-cell lymphoma. Our microarray
  strategy has identified novel candidate tumor suppressor genes inactivated by genetic
  and epigenetic mechanisms that substantially vary among the B-NHL subtypes.
