abstract: Rapid tumour progression in neuroblastoma is associated with MYCN amplification,
  deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 and gain of 17q. However, patients with
  advanced disease without MYCN amplification and or 1p deletion have a very poor
  outcome too, which suggests other genetic defects may predict an unfavourable prognosis.
  We employed CGH to study 22 tumours of patients at stages 3 and 4 over one year
  of age 6 and 16 cases respectively . Patients were divided in groups A long-term
  survivors and B short-term survivors. CGH showed a total of 226 chromosome imbalances
  110 in group A and 116 in group B . The neuroblastoma cells of long-term survivors
  showed a preponderance of numerical aberrations 54 vs 43 particularly gains of entire
  chromosomes 1 P amp lt 0.03 , 7 P amp lt 0.04 and 19 P amp lt 0.05 . An extra copy
  of 17 was detected in 6 8 75 samples of group A and only 1 14 7 samples of group
  B P amp lt 0.002 . Conversely, tumours of patients who died from disease progression
  displayed a higher frequency of structural abnormalities 43 vs 35 , including loss
  of 1p, 9p, 11q, 15q and 18q and gain of 12q, although the difference was not significant
  P 0.24 . Unbalanced gain of 17q was detected in 8 14 57 tumours of group B and only
  1 8 13 tumours of group A P amp lt 0.05 . The peculiar genetic difference observed
  in the tumours of long and short-term survivors may have prognostic relevance.
