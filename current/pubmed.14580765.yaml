abstract: Patients with ulcerative colitis have a significantly increased lifetime
  risk for the development of colorectal carcinomas. While genetic and genomic changes
  during carcinogenesis have been thoroughly studied in sporadic colorectal cancers,
  less is known about ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal carcinomas. The aim
  of this study was to extend the identification of specific genomic imbalances to
  ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal carcinomas and to establish a comprehensive
  map of DNA gains and losses by investigating 23 tumor specimens from 23 patients.
  The molecular cytogenetic characterization was performed using comparative genomic
  hybridization immunohistochemistry was used to measure proliferative activity and
  laminin-5 expression as a marker for invasiveness. The results indicate that these
  tumors are invariably aneuploid, with a high proliferative activity and increased
  invasive potential. The average number of copy alterations correlates with increased
  cyclin A levels P 0.044 , which is an independent predictor of risk of carcinoma
  development in ulcerative colitis. Despite severe genetic instability, the general
  pattern of specific chromosomal aberrations that defines sporadic colorectal carcinomas
  is maintained in ulcerative colitis-associated malignancies. High-level copy number
  increases amplifications are dispersed throughout the genome. Strikingly, these
  amplifications are much more frequent than in sporadic carcinomas and map to chromosomal
  regions that have not been described before.
