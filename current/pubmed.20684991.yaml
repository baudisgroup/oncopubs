abstract: To ascertain genomic alterations associated with Imatinib resistance in
  chronic myeloid leukaemia, we performed high resolution genomic analysis of CD34
  cells from 25 Imatinib IM resistant and 11 responders CML patients. Using patients
  T-cells as reference, we found significant association between number of acquired
  cryptic copy number alterations CNA and disease phase p 0.036 or loss of IM response
  for patients diagnosed in chronic phase CP p 0.04 . Recurrent cryptic losses were
  identified on chromosomes 7, 12 and 13. On chromosome 7, recurrent deletions of
  the IKZF1 locus were detected, for the first time, in 4 patients in CP.
