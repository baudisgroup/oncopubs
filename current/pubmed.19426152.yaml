abstract: During the neoplastic process tumour cells frequently acquire resistance
  to the antiproliferative signals of transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta . Here
  we examined a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B-TS sensitive to TGF-beta
  signalling, and a derivative line Hep3B-TR rendered resistant to TGF-beta by stepwise
  exposure to TGF-beta 1 . Comprehensive molecular cytogenetic analysis revealed that
  the acquisition of TGF-beta-resistance by Hep3B-TR cells was due to loss of TGF-beta
  receptor 2 TGFbetaRII gene. As demonstrated by spectral karyotyping and array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization, and in difference to Hep3B-TS cells, which have
  three rearranged and two normal copies of chromosome 3 that harbour the TGFbetaRII
  gene, Hep3B-TR cells have four rearranged and one apparently normal chromosome 3,
  which nonetheless underwent a critical microdeletion at the site of TGFbetaRII gene.
  Gene expression analysis using an oligonucleotide microarray of 21,397 genes showed
  that Hep3B-TR differentially expressed 307 genes, out of which 197 and 110 were
  up- and down-regulated, respectively, compared to Hep3B-TS. Six of differentially
  expressed genes were identified as downstream targets of the tumour necrosis factor
  TNF gene, suggesting that loss of TGFbetaRII triggered activation of the TNF pathway
  known to be regulated by TGF-beta 1 network. On the functional level, the TGF-beta-resistant
  Hep3B-TR cells displayed significantly enhanced capacity for anchorage independent
  growth and cell migration in vitro, and also increased tumorigenicity in vivo and
  in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity compared with parental sensitive cells.
