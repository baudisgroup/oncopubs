abstract: The molecular basis of tumorigenesis and tumor progression in meningiomas
  is not fully understood. Here we present results of conventional cytogenetic, fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH , and comparative genetic hybridization CGH analyses
  in a patient with recurrent anaplastic meningioma. We found complex aberrant karyotype
  alterations previously described in anaplastic meningiomas, such as 1p, 14q aberration,
  and a possibly tetraploid karyotype. Loss of chromosome 22q was detected by conventional
  cytogenetic analysis. Additional chromosomal aberrations not previously reported
  included a near-triploid karyotype and alterations such as 4p , 5p-, 7p , 8q , and
  gain of chromosome 19. FISH with LSI 9p21, CEP9, LSI PML RARA, and CGH confirmed
  the karyotype complexity in this case. Our findings of several previously unreported
  cytogenetic alterations suggest that complex karyotype alterations are a characteristic
  feature in anaplastic meningiomas. High chromosomal complexity might be associated
  with a highly aggressive meningioma phenotype.
