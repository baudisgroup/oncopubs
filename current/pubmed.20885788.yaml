abstract: Studies have suggested that somatic events in tumors can depend on an individuals
  constitutional genotype. We used squamous cell carcinomas SCC of the skin, which
  arise in high multiplicity in organ transplant recipients, as a model to compare
  the pattern of somatic alterations within and across individuals. Specifically,
  we performed array comparative genomic hybridization on 104 tumors from 25 unrelated
  individuals who each had three or more independently arisen SCCs and compared the
  profiles occurring within patients to profiles of tumors across a larger set of
  135 patients. In general, chromosomal aberrations in SCCs were more similar within
  than across individuals two-sided exact-test p-value amp lt 1x10 -7 , consistent
  with the notion that the genetic background was affecting the pattern of somatic
  changes. To further test this possibility, we performed allele-specific imbalance
  studies using microsatellite markers mapping to 14 frequently aberrant regions of
  multiple independent tumors from 65 patients. We identified nine loci which show
  evidence of preferential allelic imbalance. One of these loci, 8q24, corresponded
  to a region in which multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated
  with increased cancer risk in genome-wide association studies GWAS . We tested three
  implicated variants and identified one, rs13281615, with evidence of allele-specific
  imbalance p-value 0.012 . The finding of an independently identified cancer susceptibility
  allele with allele-specific imbalance in a genomic region affected by recurrent
  DNA copy number changes suggest that it may also harbor risk alleles for SCC. Together
  these data provide strong evidence that the genetic background is a key driver of
  somatic events in cancer, opening an opportunity to expand this approach to identify
  cancer risk alleles.
