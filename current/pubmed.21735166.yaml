abstract: Carcinoma showing thymus-like elements CASTLE is a rare neoplasm of the
  thyroid gland resembling lymphoepithelioma-like and squamous cell carcinoma of the
  thymus and is thought to arise from ectopic thymic tissue within the thyroid gland
  or rudimentary branchial pouches along the thymic line. Using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH , chromosomal imbalances have been detected in several types of
  thymomas and thymic carcinomas. To evaluate whether there are hints of an underlying
  sequence in the pathogenesis of CASTLE analogue to those found in thymomas and thymic
  carcinomas, we evaluated four of these rare neoplasms for chromosomal imbalances
  using CGH. The most frequent gains were seen on chromosomal arm 1q 3 4 , and losses
  were most frequently detected on 6p 4 4 , 6q 3 4 and 16q 3 4 . These CGH data show
  that CASTLE is characterized by chromosomal imbalances similar to those found in
  thymomas and thymic carcinomas and indicate a similar sequence in tumour development.
