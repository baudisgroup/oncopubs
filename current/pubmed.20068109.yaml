abstract: Several prognostic gene expression profiles have been identified in breast
  cancer. In spite of this progress in prognostic classification, the underlying mechanisms
  that drive these gene expression patterns remain unknown. Specific genomic alterations,
  such as copy number alterations, are an important factor in tumor development and
  progression and are also associated with changes in gene expression.
