abstract: The importance of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in the oncogenesis of gastrointestinal
  stromal tumors GIST is well established, but the genetic basis of GIST metastasis
  is poorly understood. We recently published a 67 gene expression prognostic signature
  related to genome complexity CINSARC for Complexity INdex in SARComas and asked
  whether it could predict outcome in GISTs.
