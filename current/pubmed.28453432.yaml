abstract: Purpose To assess the underlying genomic variation of prostate gland microenvironments
  of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma in the context of colocalized multiparametric
  magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histopathologic assessment of normal and abnormal
  regions by using whole-exome sequencing. Materials and Methods Six patients with
  prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent robotic prostatectomy with whole-mount preservation
  of the prostate were identified, which enabled spatial mapping between preoperative
  multiparametric MR imaging and the gland. Four regions of interest were identified
  within each gland, including regions found to be normal and abnormal via histopathologic
  analysis. Whole-exome DNA sequencing (>50 times coverage) was performed on each
  of these spatially targeted regions. Radiogenomic analysis of imaging and mutation
  data were performed with hierarchical clustering, phylogenetic analysis, and principal
  component analysis. Results Radiogenomic multiparametric MR imaging and whole-exome
  spatial characterization in six patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (three patients,
  Gleason score of 3 + 4; and three patients, Gleason score of 4 + 5) was performed
  across 23 spatially distinct regions. Hierarchical clustering separated histopathologic
  analysis-proven high-grade lesions from the normal regions, and this reflected concordance
  between multiparametric MR imaging and resultant histopathologic analysis in all
  patients. Seventy-seven mutations involving 29 cancer-associated genes across the
  23 spatially distinct prostate samples were identified. There was no significant
  difference in mutation load in cancer-associated genes between regions that were
  proven to be normal via histopathologic analysis (34 mutations per sample ï¿½ 19),
  mildly suspicious via multiparametric MR imaging (37 mutations per sample ï¿½ 21),
  intermediately suspicious via multiparametric MR imaging (31 mutations per sample
  ï¿½ 15), and high-grade cancer (33 mutations per sample ï¿½ 18) (P = .30). Principal
  component analysis resolved samples from different patients and further classified
  samples (regardless of histopathologic status) from prostate glands with Gleason
  score 3 + 4 versus 4 + 5 samples. Conclusion Multiregion spatial multiparametric
  MR imaging and whole-exome radiogenomic analysis of prostate glands with adenocarcinoma
  shows a continuum of mutations across regions that were found via histologic analysis
  to be high grade and normal. ï¿½ RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available
