abstract: "Recurrent gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, and acquired genomic
  copy number aberrations (aCNA) have been variously associated with acute myelogenous
  leukemia (AML) patient outcome. However, knowledge of the co-occurrence of such
  lesions and the relative influence of different types of genomic alterations on
  clinical outcomes in AML is still evolving.  We performed SNP 6.0 array-based genomic
  profiling of aCNA/copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (cnLOH) along with sequence
  analysis of 13 commonly mutated genes on purified leukemic blast DNA from 156 prospectively
  enrolled non-FAB-M3 AML patients across the clinical spectrum of de novo, secondary,
  and therapy-related AML.  TP53 and RUNX1 mutations are strongly associated with
  the presence of SNP-A-based aCNA/cnLOH, while FLT3 and NPM1 mutations are strongly
  associated with the absence of aCNA/cnLOH. The presence of mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1,
  and TP53, elevated SNP-A-based genomic complexity, and specific recurrent aCNAs
  predicted failure to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy. The
  presence of â\x89¥1 aCNA/cnLOH and higher thresholds predicted for poor long-term
  survival irrespective of TP53 status, and the presence of â\x89¥1 aCNA/cnLOH added
  negative prognostic information to knowledge of mutations in TET2, IDH1, NPM1, DNMT3A,
  and RUNX1. Results of multivariate analyses support a dominant role for TP53 mutations
  and a role for elevated genomic complexity as predictors of short survival in AML.
  \ Integrated genomic profiling of a clinically relevant adult AML cohort identified
  genomic aberrations most associated with SNP-A-based genomic complexity, resistance
  to intensive induction therapies, and shortened overall survival. Identifying SNP-A-based
  lesions adds prognostic value to the status of several recurrently mutated genes.
