abstract: Various genomic alterations have been detected in glioblastoma. Chromosome
  7p, with the epidermal growth factor receptor locus, together with chromosome 10q,
  with the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10 and deleted in
  malignant brain tumors-1 loci, and chromosome 9p, with the cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor 2A locus, are among the most frequently damaged chromosomal regions in
  glioblastoma. In this study, we evaluated the genetic status of 32 glioblastomas
  by comparative genomic hybridization the sensitivity of comparative genomic hybridization
  versus differential polymerase chain reaction to detect deletions at the phosphatase
  and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10, deleted in malignant brain tumors-1,
  and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A loci and amplifications at the cyclin-dependent
  kinase 4 locus the frequency of genetic lesions gain or loss at 16 different selected
  loci including oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and proliferation markers mapping
  on 13 different chromosomes and the possible existence of a statistical association
  between any pair of molecular markers studied, to subdivide the glioblastoma entity
  molecularly. Comparative genomic hybridization showed that the most frequent region
  of gain was chromosome 7p, whereas the most frequent losses occurred on chromosomes
  10q and 13q. The only statistically significant association was found for 7p gain
  and 10q loss.
