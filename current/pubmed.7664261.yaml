abstract: Human cutaneous malignant melanoma progresses through a series of well defined
  clinical and histopathological stages. It has been assumed that the neoplastic progression
  of this disease advances from a common acquired nevus or dysplastic nevus through
  the primary radial growth phase RGP , primary vertical growth phase VGP , and finally
  to distant metastasis. However, it has never been directly shown that VGP is clonally
  derived from RGP. Furthermore, it has not been possible previously to conduct a
  detailed genetic analysis on pure tumor cells from archival material because the
  lesions are a heterogeneous mixture of normal and neoplastic cells, and the entire
  specimen must be excised and fixed for clinical diagnosis. This report describes
  a new approach designed to identify DNA copy number changes in tumor cells from
  a series of progressive primary stages of cutaneous melanoma archival biopsies.
  Under direct high-power visualization, cells are procured with a sterile needle
  from highly specific areas of the tissue section. DNA is extracted from microdissected
  cells normal, RGP, and VGP , PCR amplified, fluorescently labeled, and examined
  by comparative genomic hybridization to determine DNA copy number changes. Data
  obtained from three representative cases suggest a clonal derivation of VGP cells
  from RGP. This approach could be useful in identifying the sequence of genetic changes
  in progressive cutaneous melanoma stages.
