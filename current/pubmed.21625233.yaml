abstract: Despite recent therapeutic improvements, the prognosis for patients suffering
  from SÃ©zary syndrome (SS), a disseminated form of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, is
  still poor. We identified bi- and monoallelic deletions of the tumor necrosis factor-Î±-induced
  protein 3 gene (TNFAIP3; A20) in a high proportion of SS patients as well as biallelic
  A20 deletion in the SS-derived cell line SeAx. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
  inhibition of A20 activates the NF-ÎºB pathway thereby increasing the proliferation
  of normal T lymphocytes. On the other hand, the reconstitution of A20 expression
  slowed down the cell cycle in SeAx cells. Recently A20 inactivation has been reported
  in various B-cell lymphomas. In this study, we show that A20 is also a putative
  tumor suppressor in the T-cell malignancy-SS.
