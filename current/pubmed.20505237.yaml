abstract: 'Background: Around 30 of all stage II colon cancer patients will relapse
  and die of their disease. At present no objective parameters to identify high-risk
  stage II colon cancer patients, who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, have
  been established. With traditional histopathological features definition of high-risk
  stage II colon cancer patients is inaccurate. Therefore more objective and robust
  markers for prediction of relapse are needed. DNA copy number aberrations have proven
  to be robust prognostic markers, but have not yet been investigated for this specific
  group of patients. The aim of the present study was to identify chromosomal aberrations
  that can predict relapse of tumor in patients with stage II colon cancer.Materials
  and methods: DNA was isolated from 40 formaldehyde fixed paraffin embedded stage
  II colon cancer samples with extensive clinicopathological data. Samples were hybridized
  using Comparative Genomic Hybridization CGH arrays to determine DNA copy number
  changes and microsatellite stability was determined by PCR. To analyze differences
  between stage II colon cancer patients with and without relapse of tumor a Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test was implemented with multiple testing correction.Results: Stage II
  colon cancers of patients who had relapse of disease showed significantly more losses
  on chromosomes 4, 5, 15q, 17q and 18q. In the microsatellite stable MSS subgroup
  n 28 , only loss of chromosome 4q22.1-4q35.2 was significantly associated with disease
  relapse p amp lt 0.05, FDR amp lt 0.15 . No differences in clinicopathological characteristics
  between patients with and without relapse were observed.Conclusion: In the present
  series of MSS stage II colon cancer patients losses on 4q22.1-4q35.2 were associated
  with worse outcome and these genomic alterations may aid in selecting patients for
  adjuvant therapy.'
