abstract: 'Genetic alterations in specific driver genes lead to disruption of cellular
  pathways and are critical events in the instigation and progression of hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC . As a prerequisite for individualized cancer treatment, we sought
  to characterize the landscape of recurrent somatic mutations in HCC. We performed
  whole-exome sequencing on 87 HCCs and matched normal adjacent tissues to an average
  coverage of 59 . The overall mutation rate was roughly two mutations per Mb, with
  a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations that altered the amino acid sequence range,
  2-381 . We found recurrent mutations in several genes with high transcript levels:
  TP53 18 CTNNB1 10 KEAP1 8 C16orf62 8 MLL4 7 and RAC2 5 . Significantly affected
  gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing
  family, calcium channel subunits, and histone methyltransferases. In particular,
  the MLL family of methyltransferases for histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20
  of tumors. Conclusion: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated
  in multiple cohorts of HCC. Hepatology 2013 .'
