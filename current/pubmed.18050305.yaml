abstract: Testicular germ cell tumors of adolescents and adults TGCTs can be classified
  into seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumors. Various nonseminomatous cell lines,
  predominantly embryonal carcinoma, have been established and proven to be valuable
  for pathobiological and clinical studies. So far, no cell lines have been derived
  from seminoma which constitutes more than 50 of invasive TGCTs. Such a cell line
  is essential for experimental investigation of biological characteristics of the
  cell of origin of TGCTs, i.e., carcinoma in situ of the testis, which shows characteristics
  of a seminoma cell. Before a cell line can be used as model, it must be verified
  regarding its origin and characteristics. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach
  was undertaken on TCam-2 cells, supposedly the first seminoma cell line. Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization, and spectral karyotyping
  demonstrated an aneuploid DNA content, with gain of 12p, characteristic for TGCTs.
  Genome wide mRNA and microRNA expression profiling supported the seminoma origin,
  in line with the biallelic expression of imprinted genes IGF2 H19 and associated
  demethylation of the imprinting control region. Moreover, the presence of specific
  markers, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, including wild type KIT, stem cell
  factor, placental alkaline phosphatase, OCT3 4 also demonstrated by a specific Q-PCR
  and NANOG, and the absence of CD30, SSX2-4, and SOX2, confirms that TCam-2 is a
  seminoma cell line. Although mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are
  rather rare in TGCTs, TCam-2 had a mutated BRAF gene V600E , which likely explains
  the fact that these cells could be propagated in vitro. In conclusion, TCam-2 is
  the first well-characterized seminoma-derived cell line, with an exceptional mutation,
  rarely found in TGCTs.
