abstract: Spindle-cell ameloblastic carcinoma is a classification proposed for a group
  of rare odontogenic carcinomas with sarcomatoid components and is distinguished
  from odontogenic carcinosarcoma. We report a case of spindle-cell ameloblastic carcinoma
  of the right mandible that occurred in a 67-year-old Japanese man. Growth of the
  tumor was destructive, there was extensive lung metastasis, and the outcome was
  unfavorable. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examination showed the spindle-cell
  component of the tumor to be epithelial in character. A gain of 5q with amplification
  of 5q13 was detected in the tumor by comparative genomic hybridization.
