abstract: We compared whole genomic changes in cell lines generated from esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma ESCC and esophageal adenocarcinoma EAC . To do so, we investigated
  chromosomal DNA copy number changes in four EAC cell lines and three ESCC cell lines
  using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Frequent gains of chromosome 5p, 8q,
  and 20q occurred in both ESCC and EAC cell lines, but gains of 3q, 5q, and 9q were
  mainly seen in ESCC cell lines gain of chromosome 10q25-qtel was mainly seen in
  EAC cell lines. It was noticeable that 18q12 loss existed in 2 EAC and 1 ESCC cell
  lines in our study. The chromosomal abnormalities common to all of the cell lines
  may help to identify candidate genes related to both EAC and ESCC. The chromosome
  aberrations mainly seen in either EAC or ESCC cell lines are in keeping with their
  known different etiology and may lead to the identification of genes important for
  disease specific pathogenesis.
