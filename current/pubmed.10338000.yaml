abstract: 'Esophageal cancer is the third most prevalent gastrointestinal malignancy
  in the world. The tumor responds poorly to various therapeutic regimens and the
  genetic events underlying esophageal carcinogenesis are not well understood. To
  identify overall chromosomal aberrations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
  we performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH . All 17 tumor samples were found
  to exhibit multiple gains and losses involving different chromosomal regions. The
  frequency of chromosomal loss associated with this type of tumor was as follows:
  in 2q 100 , 3p 100 , 13q 100 , Xq 94 , 4 82 , 5q 82 , 18q 76 , 9p 76 , 6q 70 , 12q
  70 , 14q 65 , 11q 59 , and 1p 53 . Interstitial deletions on 1p, 3p, 5q, 6q, 11q,
  and 12q were detected also. Chromosomal gains were displayed by chromosomes and
  chromosome areas: 19 100 , 20q 94 , 22 94 , 16p 65 , 17 59 , 12q 59 , 8q 53 , 9q
  53 , and 3q 50 . Two sites showing apparent amplification were 11q 70 and 5p15 47
  . To validate the CGH data, we isolated a BAC clone mapping to 18q12.1. This clone
  was used as a probe in interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization of tumor touch
  preparations and allelic loss was clearly revealed. This study represents the first
  whole-genome analysis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma for associated chromosomal
  aberrations that may be involved in either the genesis or progression of this malignancy.'
