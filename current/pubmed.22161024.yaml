abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC is the most common well-differentiated thyroid
  cancer. Although the great majority of the cases exhibit an indolent clinical course,
  some of them develop local invasion with distant metastasis, and a few cases transform
  into undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma with a rapidly lethal course.
  To identify gene copy number alterations predictive of metastatic potential or aggressive
  transformation, array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH-array was performed
  in 43 PTC cases. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples from primary tumours
  of 16 cases without metastasis, 14 cases with only regional lymph node metastasis,
  and 13 cases with distant metastasis, recurrence or extrathyroid extension were
  analysed. The CGH-array and confirmatory quantitative real-time PCR results identified
  the deletion of the EIF4EBP3 and TRAK2 gene loci, while amplification of thymosin
  beta 10 TB10 and Tre-2 oncogene regions were observed as general markers for PTC.
  Although there have been several studies implicating TB10 as a specific marker based
  on gene expression data, our study is the first to report on genomic amplification.
  Although no significant difference could be detected between the good and bad prognosis
  cases in the A-kinase anchor protein 13 AKAP13 gene region, it was discriminative
  markers for metastasis. Amplification in the AKAP13 region was demonstrated in 42.9
  and 15.4 of the cases with local or with distant metastasis, respectively, while
  no amplification was detected in non-metastatic cases. AKAP13 and TB10 regions may
  represent potential new genomic markers for PTC and cancer progression.
