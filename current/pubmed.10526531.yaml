abstract: Lung carcinomas are represented by non-small-cell lung carcinomas NSCLC
  and neuroendocrine carcinomas NE which differ in their clinical presentation and
  prognosis. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to characterize and compare
  the chromosomal pattern of 11 NSCLC and 11 high-grade NE lung carcinomas. Overall,
  the total number of aberrations was higher in NSCLC than in high-grade NE lung tumors
  p amp lt 0.05 and gains predominated over losses in NSCLC p amp lt 0.0003 . Gains
  common to both lung tumor phenotypes were detected in 1p, 1q, 3q, 5p, 6p, 8q, 12,
  17q, 19p, 19q, 20p, 20q, and X, whereas common losses were found in 2q, 3p, 4p,
  4q, 5q, 8p, 9p, 10p, 11p, 11q, 13q, and 17p. Major gains on 18q and losses on 2p
  and 16q were exclusively detected in high-grade NE lung tumors. On the other hand,
  major gains on 2p and 15q and losses on 21q were found only in NSCLC. Furthermore,
  gains within 22q11-q12 and 7p12-p15 were associated with NSCLC p amp lt 0.05 . The
  differences in the pattern and distribution of genetic changes observed in NSCLC
  as opposed to high-grade NE lung carcinomas suggest the existence of distinct tumorigenic
  pathways between these two major classes of lung tumors.
