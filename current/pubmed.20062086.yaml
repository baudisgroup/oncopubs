abstract: Endometrial cancer is one of the tumor types in which either chromosomal
  instability CIN or microsatellite instability MSI may occur. It is known to possess
  mutations frequently in the Ras-PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. We performed
  a comprehensive genomic survey in 31 endometrial carcinomas with paired DNA for
  chromosomal imbalances 25 by the 50K and 6 by the 250K single-nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP array , and screened 25 of the 31 samples for MSI status and mutational status
  in the Ras-PI3K pathway genes. We detected five or more copy number changes classified
  as CIN-extensive in 9 29 , 1 to 4 changes CIN-intermediate in 17 55 and no changes
  CIN-negative in 5 16 tumors. Positive MSI was less common in CIN-extensive tumors
  14 , compared with CIN-intermediate negative tumors 50 , and multivariate analysis
  showed that CIN-extensive is an independent poor prognostic factor. SNP array analysis
  unveiled copy number neutral LOH at 54 loci in 13 tumors 42 , including four at
  the locus of PTEN. In addition to eight 26 tumors with PTEN deletions, we detected
  chromosomal imbalances of NF1, K-Ras and PIK3CA in four 13 , four 13 and six 19
  tumors, respectively. In all, 7 of the 9 CIN-extensive tumors harbor deletions in
  the loci of PTEN and or NF1, whereas all the 10 MSI-positive tumors possess PTEN,
  PIK3CA and or K-Ras mutations. Our results showed that genomic alterations in the
  Ras-PI3K pathway are remarkably widespread in endometrial carcinomas, regardless
  of the type of genomic instability, and suggest that the degree of CIN is a useful
  biomarker for prognosis in endometrial carcinomas.
