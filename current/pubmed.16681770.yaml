abstract: The aim of this study was to identify amplified oncogenes in endometrial
  cancer using array-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH . Despite its
  prevalence, the molecular mechanisms of endometrial carcinogenesis are still poorly
  understood. The selected array CGH allows the simultaneous examination of 58 oncogenes
  commonly amplified in human cancers and is capable of achieving increased mapping
  resolution compared with conventional CGH. A subset of 8 specimens from a bank of
  60 malignant and normal specimens was selected for array analysis to identify potential
  genes of interest. TaqMan polymerase chain reaction was carried out on the 60 specimens
  to examine if aberrations at the genomic level correlated with gene expression and
  to compare expression in normal and malignant samples. Oncogenes amplified in the
  endometrial cancers included AR, PIK3CA, MET, HRAS, NRAS, D17S1670, FGFR1, CTSB,
  RPS6KB1, LAMC2, MYC, PDGFRA, FGF4 FGF3, PAKI, and FGR. Three genes were examined
  at the messenger RNA level. AR and PIK3CA were higher in normal specimens, and MET
  was higher in malignant samples, suggesting a role for MET in endometrial cancer.
  Newer arrays examining more genes and larger sample numbers are necessary to elucidate
  the carcinogenic pathway in endometrial cancer.
