abstract: Consistent tumor-specific chromosomal aberrations have not been described
  in low-grade astrocytic tumors. The most frequent genetic alterations are mutations
  of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene and or loss of heterozygosity LOH on 17p that
  occur in about 30 of the cases in adult patients but that are uncommon in childhood
  tumors. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to map DNA copy number alterations
  in 18 primary low-grade astrocytic tumors ten adult patients and eight children
  . A gain of chromosome arm 7q was the most frequent event detected in five of ten
  astrocytomas 50 from adult patients, followed by DNA amplification on chromosome
  arm 8q and gain on 12p two cases . Loss of chromosomal regions on 1p, 4q, and the
  X chromosome was observed in two of ten cases including one patient afflicted with
  Turner syndrome 45,X . In contrast, no consistent changes were observed in low-grade
  astrocytomas in children. A loss of the X chromosome was the sole aberration detected
  in two of eight cases using DNA extracted from the normal brain tissue. The findings
  suggest that a gain of 7q is an early event in the initiation of astrocytomas in
  adult patients. The discrepant findings in low-grade astrocytic tumors in adults
  compared to tumors in children support the the hypothesis that there might be different
  mechanisms responsible for tumor development.
