abstract: One of the most controversial issues in breast pathology is whether lobular
  neoplasia LN is a risk factor or a precursor lesion of invasive lobular carcinoma
  ILC . This is consequent to the fact that no conclusive data on the biology of LN
  exist. Molecular studies of LN and ILC are scanty, variable, and not consistent.
  Clonality of 12 cases of LN and ILC present simultaneously in the same block has
  been studied. Cells from both lesions were obtained by microdissection and were
  studied for mitochondrial DNA mtDNA , D-loop sequencing, and neighbor-joining trees.
  Eight of the same cases were studied with comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  array to have additional data consistent with mtDNA. In all cases, loss of heterozygosity
  was studied for D16S496,locus 16q22.1 related to e-cadherin. It appears that no
  fewer than eight cases were genetically very similar clonal with mtDNA. Seven of
  these cases appeared also clonal with CGH array. It is concluded that in the present
  series, LN and ILC are genetically related lesions in the majority of cases and
  that LN might be the precursor of ILC.
