abstract: Core binding factor CBF AML with the D816 C-KIT gene mutation demonstrate
  inferior treatment outcomes. However, the remaining cases without the D816 C-KIT
  mutation imply a requirement of more sophisticated dissection of the patients according
  to their prognosis. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic value of a single
  nucleotide polymorphism array SNP-A based karyotyping combined with metaphase cytogenetics
  MC to facilitate further stratification of CBF AML patients. A total of 98 CBF AML
  patients were included and genome-wide Human SNP 6.0 Arrays Affymetrix were performed
  using marrow samples taken at diagnosis. Overall, 40 abnormal lesions were identified
  in 25 patients 26 . Survival of the patients with the abnormal lesion s detected
  by SNP-A and or MC was worse than those without lesions in terms of the 2-year overall
  survival OS 57.5 vs. 76.4 , P 0.028 , event-free EFS 45.7 vs. 66.2 , P 0.072 , and
  leukemia-free survival LFS 49.0 vs. 77.4 , P 0.015 , specially in the subgroup with
  inv 16 t 16 16 40.9 vs. 80.2 OS, P 0.040 and in the subgroup without the D816 C-KIT
  mutation 61.6 vs. 82.7 OS, P 0.038 . Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic
  impact of the abnormal SNP-A and or MC lesion on EFS HR 2.011, P 0.047 , and LFS
  HR 3.231, P 0.005 in the overall CBF AML. This study suggests that the combined
  use of SNP-A with MC in the CBF AML can provide important prognostic value, especially
  in the inv 16 t 16 16 subgroup or in the patients without the D816 C-KIT mutation.
