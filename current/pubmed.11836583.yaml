abstract: Fluorescence diagnosis of superficial bladder cancer using 5-aminolevulinic
  acid ALA is a highly sensitive technique 95 . However, the specificity is only 60-70
  due to false-positive results after histopathological examination. We hypothesized
  that the biopsies in fluorescence endoscopy could represent early preneoplastic
  lesions not detectable by histopathology. In order to evaluate the specificity of
  fluorescence endoscopy at the molecular genetic level we performed comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and investigated telomerase activity of ALA-positive tissue samples.
  For CGH, DNA was isolated from 5-10 frozen sections. Tumor and normal control DNAs
  were amplified by DOP-PCR and labeled with biotin-dUTP and digoxigenin-dUTP, respectively.
  Hybridization and detection were carried out according to standard protocols. Telomerase
  activity was analyzed using a non-radioactive system TRAP-assay . In 33 out of 118
  bladder cancer cases 28 detected by conventional cystoscopy, additional suspicious
  areas were found using ALA. CGH revealed genetic changes in 27 of samples with non-malignant
  histological diagnoses. Telomerase activity was found in 59 of these samples. Tumor
  samples showed genetic alterations in 84 and in 69 telomerase activity occurred.
  The type of genetic alterations in the normal biopsies was identical to the tumors.
  Based on these molecular data, the portion of false-positive results obtained by
  fluorescence diagnosis is lower than defined by histopathology alone. Genetic alterations
  and activation of telomerase activity are early events of tumor development in bladder
  cancer occurring earlier than histological features of neoplasia. The clinical importance
  of fluorescence diagnosis and the possible reduction of the recurrence rate have
  to be shown in ongoing clinical studies.
