abstract: Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) are among the most common solid tumors
  in children but, apart from BRAF kinase mutations or duplications in specific subclasses,
  few genetic driver events are known. Diffuse PLGGs comprise a set of uncommon subtypes
  that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically.
  We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
  diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such
  alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly
  recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of
  diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription
  factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar
  recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas
  in the related gene v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) on 6q23.3.
  Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged diffuse astrocytoma grade II demonstrated
  MYBL1 tandem duplication and few other events. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified
  in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation
  in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors
  with MYBL1 partial duplication. Our results define clinically relevant molecular
  subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in
  the biology of low-grade gliomas.
