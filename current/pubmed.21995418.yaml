abstract: The mucosae of the oral cavity are different at the histological level but
  appear all equally exposed to common genotoxic agents. As a result of this exposure,
  changes in the mucosal epithelia may develop giving rise to Oral Potentially Malignant
  Lesions OPMLs , which with time may in turn progress to Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas
  OSCCs . Therefore, much effort should be devoted to identify features able to predict
  the likeliness of progression associated with an OPML. Such features may be helpful
  in assisting the clinician to establish both appropriate therapies and follow-up
  schedules. Here, we report a pilot study that compared the occurrence of DNA aneuploidy
  and chromosomal copy number aberrations CNAs in the OPMLs from different oral anatomical
  subsites.
