abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was applied to detect and map changes
  in DNA copy number in 24 well or moderately differentiated epithelial ovarian carcinomas
  eight serous, eight mucinous and eight endometrioid carcinomas . Twenty-three of
  the 24 tumours showed changes in DNA copy number in one or several regions median
  4, range 1-17 . Gains were more frequent than losses ratio 1.6:1.0 . The most frequent
  gains occurred in chromosomes 1q 38 , 2p 29 , 7q 25 , 8q 38 and 17q 38 , and the
  most common losses were located in chromosomes 8p 21 , 9p 25 and 13q 21 . High-level
  amplifications were detected in seven tumours at 1q22-32, 2p15-22, 3qcen-23, 6p21-22
  and 8q. In the three histological subtypes the copy number karyotypes showed substantial
  differences. Gains at 1q were observed in endometrioid five cases and serous tumours
  four cases . Increased copy number at 10q was seen in endometrioid tumours only
  four cases , whereas gains at 11q occurred mostly in serous tumours four cases .
  In mucinous tumours, the most common copy number change was a gain at 17q six cases
  . The results show that, in epithelial ovarian carcinoma, changes in DNA copy number
  are a rule rather than an exception, chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 17 being
  the most frequently affected. The diverging pattern of genetic changes seen in epithelial
  ovarian carcinomas with different histological phenotypes suggests that various
  pathways may lead to tumorigenesis and or progression in these subgroups.
