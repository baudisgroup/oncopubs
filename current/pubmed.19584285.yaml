abstract: 'Genomic instability plays an important role in most human cancers. To characterize
  genomic instability in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC , we examined loss
  of heterozygosity LOH , copy number CN loss, CN gain, and gene expression using
  the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K n 30 cases and Human U133A n 17 cases
  arrays in ESCC cases from a high-risk region of China. We found that genomic instability
  measures varied widely among cases and separated them into two groups: a high-frequency
  instability group two-thirds of all cases with one or more instability category
  of amp gt or 10 and a low-frequency instability group one-third of cases with instability
  of amp lt 10 . Genomic instability also varied widely across chromosomal arms, with
  the highest frequency of LOH on 9p 33 of informative single nucleotide polymorphisms
  , CN loss on 3p 33 , and CN gain on 3q 48 . Twenty-two LOH regions were identified:
  four on 9p, seven on 9q, four on 13q, two on 17p, and five on 17q. Three CN loss
  regions-3p12.3, 4p15.1, and 9p21.3-were detected. Twelve CN gain regions were found,
  including six on 3q, one on 7q, four on 8q, and one on 11q. One of the most gene-rich
  of these CN gain regions was 11q13.1-13.4, where 26 genes also had RNA expression
  data available. CN gain was significantly correlated with increased RNA expression
  in over 80 of these genes. Our findings show the potential utility of combining
  CN analysis and gene expression data to identify genes involved in esophageal carcinogenesis.'
