abstract: Prostate cancer, the most common male cancer in Western countries, is commonly
  detected with complex chromosomal rearrangements. Following the discovery of the
  recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer and EML4:ALK in non-small-cell
  lung cancer, it is now accepted that fusion genes not only are the hallmark of haematological
  malignancies and sarcomas, but also play an important role in epithelial cell carcinogenesis.
  However, previous studies aiming to identify fusion genes in prostate cancer were
  mainly focused on expression changes and fusion transcripts. To investigate the
  genes recurrently affected by the chromosome breakpoints in prostate cancer, we
  analysed Affymetrix array 6.0 and 500K SNP microarray data from 77 prostate cancer
  samples. While the two genes most frequently affected by genomic breakpoints were,
  as expected, ERG and TMPRSS2, surprisingly more known tumour suppressor genes TSGs
  than known oncogenes were identified at recurrent chromosome breakpoints. Certain
  well-characterised TSGs, including p53, PTEN, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are recurrently truncated
  as a result of chromosome rearrangements in prostate cancer. Interestingly, many
  of the genes residing at recurrent breakpoint sites have not yet been implicated
  in prostate carcinogenesis such as HOOK3, PPP2R2A and TCBA1. We have confirmed the
  generally reduced expression of selected genes in clinical samples using quantitative
  RT-PCR analysis. Subsequently, we further investigated the genes associated with
  the t 4:6 translocation in LNCaP cells and reveal the genomic fusion of SNX9 and
  putative TSG UNC5C, which led to the reduced expression of both genes. This study
  reveals another common mechanism that leads to the inactivation of TSGs in prostate
  cancer and the identification of multiple TSGs inactivated by chromosome rearrangements
  will lead to new direction of research for the molecular basis of prostate carcinogenesis.
