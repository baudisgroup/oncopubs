abstract: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas NHL represent a frequent complication of human immunodeficiency
  virus HIV infection. To elucidate HIV-NHL pathogenesis, we performed a genome-wide
  DNA profiling based on a single nucleotide polymorphism-based microarray comparative
  genomic hybridization in 57 HIV-lymphomas and, for comparison, in 105 immunocompetent
  diffuse large B-cell lymphomas IC-DLBCL . Genomic complexity varied across HIV-NHL
  subtypes. HIV-Burkitt lymphoma showed a significantly lower number of lesions than
  HIV-DLBCL P 0.032 , whereas the median number of copy number changes was significantly
  higher in Epstein-Barr virus negative EBV- HIV-DLBCL 42.5, range 8-153 compared
  to EBV cases 22 range 3-41 P 0.029 . Compared to IC-DLBCL, HIV-DLBCL displayed a
  distinct genomic profile with no gains of 18q and specific genetic lesions. Fragile
  sites-associated genes, including FHIT FRA3B , WWOX FRA16D , DCC FRA18B and PARK2
  FRA6E were frequently inactivated in HIV-NHL by interstitial deletions, and a significantly
  higher prevalence of FHIT alterations was observed in HIV-DLBCL compared to IC-DLBCL.
  The same genes involved by fragile site deletions were also frequently affected
  by aberrant methylation of regulative regions.
