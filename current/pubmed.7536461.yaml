abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH makes it possible to detect losses
  and gains of DNA sequences along all chromosomes in a tumor specimen based on the
  hybridization of differentially labeled tumor and normal DNA to normal human metaphase
  chromosomes. In this study, CGH analysis was applied to the identification of genomic
  imbalances in 26 bladder cancers in order to gain information on the genetic events
  underlying the development and progression of this malignancy. Losses affecting
  11p, 11q, 8p, 9, 17p, 3p, and 12q were all seen in more than 20 of the tumors. The
  minimal common region of loss in each chromosome was identified based on the analysis
  of overlapping deletions in different tumors. Gains of DNA sequences were most often
  found at chromosomal regions distinct from the locations of currently known oncogenes.
  The bands involved in more than 10 of the tumors were 8q21, 13q21-q34, 1q31, 3q24-q26,
  and 1p22. In conclusion, these CGH data highlight several previously unreported
  genetic alterations in bladder cancer. Further detailed studies of these regions
  with specific molecular genetic techniques may lead to the identification of tumor
  suppressor genes and oncogenes that play an important role in bladder tumorigenesis.
