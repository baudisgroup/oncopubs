abstract: Gene-expression profiling has been used to define 3 molecular subtypes of
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL , termed germinal center B-cell-like GCB DLBCL,
  activated B-cell-like ABC DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma PMBL .
  To investigate whether these DLBCL subtypes arise by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms,
  we analyzed 203 DLBCL biopsy samples by high-resolution, genome-wide copy number
  analysis coupled with gene-expression profiling. Of 272 recurrent chromosomal aberrations
  that were associated with gene-expression alterations, 30 were used differentially
  by the DLBCL subtypes P amp lt 0.006 . An amplicon on chromosome 19 was detected
  in 26 of ABC DLBCLs but in only 3 of GCB DLBCLs and PMBLs. A highly up-regulated
  gene in this amplicon was SPIB, which encodes an ETS family transcription factor.
  Knockdown of SPIB by RNA interference was toxic to ABC DLBCL cell lines but not
  to GCB DLBCL, PMBL, or myeloma cell lines, strongly implicating SPIB as an oncogene
  involved in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Deletion of the INK4a ARF tumor suppressor
  locus and trisomy 3 also occurred almost exclusively in ABC DLBCLs and was associated
  with inferior outcome within this subtype. FOXP1 emerged as a potential oncogene
  in ABC DLBCL that was up-regulated by trisomy 3 and by more focal high-level amplifications.
  In GCB DLBCL, amplification of the oncogenic mir-17-92 microRNA cluster and deletion
  of the tumor suppressor PTEN were recurrent, but these events did not occur in ABC
  DLBCL. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are
  distinct diseases that use different oncogenic pathways.
