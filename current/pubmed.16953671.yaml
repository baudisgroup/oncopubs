abstract: Genetic gains and losses resulting from DNA strand breakage by ionizing
  radiation have been demonstrated in vitro and suspected in radiation-associated
  thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that copy number deviations might be more prevalent,
  and or occur in genomic patterns, in tumors associated with presumptive DNA strand
  breakage from radiation exposure than in their spontaneous counterparts. We used
  cDNA microarray-based comparative genome hybridization to obtain genome-wide, high-resolution
  copy number profiles at 14,573 genomic loci in 23 post-Chernobyl and 20 spontaneous
  thyroid cancers. The prevalence of DNA gains in tumors from cases in exposed individuals
  was two- to fourfold higher than for cases in unexposed individuals and up to 10-fold
  higher for the subset of recurrent gains. DNA losses for all cases were low and
  more prevalent in spontaneous cases. We identified unique patterns of copy variation
  mostly gains that depended on a history of radiation exposure. Exposed cases, especially
  the young, harbored more recurrent gains that covered more of the genome. The largest
  regions, spanning 1.2 to 4.9 Mbp, were located at 1p36.32-.33, 2p23.2-.3, 3p21.1-.31,
  6p22.1-.2, 7q36.1, 8q24.3, 9q34.11, 9q34.3, 11p15.5, 11q13.2-12.3, 14q32.33, 16p13.3,
  16p11.2, 16q21-q12.2, 17q25.1, 19p13.31-qter, 22q11.21 and 22q13.2. Copy number
  changes, particularly gains, in post-Chernobyl thyroid cancer are influenced by
  radiation exposure and age at exposure, in addition to the neoplastic process.
