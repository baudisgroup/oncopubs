abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare the chromosomal genotype between
  breast cancers with and without secondary manifestations and between primary tumors
  and their secondary manifestations. Eighty six breast cancers, twenty lymph node
  metastases, ten distant metastases and ten local recurrences were analyzed by comparative
  genomic hybridization. Tumors with local recurrences showed significant more frequent
  losses at 2q32 than the tumors without recurrences. Lymph node positive cases showed
  significant more frequent losses at 9p21 than node negative cases. Lymph node metastases
  exhibited significant more frequent losses at 7q11, 14q24.3-q31 and 17q22-q24 than
  their primary tumors. In cases with distant metastases, losses at 5q23 were more
  frequent than in those without, but not reaching the significance level. The distant
  metastases showed significant more frequent losses at 5p15, 12q24 and 17q22-q24
  than the primary tumors. These results reveal strong evidence that the potential
  for progression is determined in the primary tumor and that different ways of the
  development of local recurrences, lymph node and distant metastases exist. After
  confirmation of the results by interphase FISH on tissue micro arrays, the detection
  of these specific chromosomal imbalances may contribute to a more individual prediction
  of prognosis in breast cancer.
