abstract: We describe amplification of the MYCC oncogene in a medulloblastoma with
  aggressive clinical behavior. The patient was a six year old boy who underwent gross
  total surgical excision of a cerebellar tumor. Despite chemotherapy and total neuraxis
  radiation, the clinical course was one of relentless progression, with extensive
  subarachnoid spread and death within eight months of presentation. The pathological
  features were consistent with the recently described, amp quot large cell variant
  amp quot of medulloblastoma. Tumor cells exhibited large vesicular nuclei, prominent
  nucleoli and strong immunoreactivity for synaptophysin. Polymerase chain reaction
  PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH assay revealed no evidence of MYCN
  amplification or 1p deletion in the tumor. FISH analysis revealed evidence of MYCC
  amplification in the 20- to 30-fold range. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  revealed regions of gains and amplification in three locations, with gains of chromosome
  7, amplification of 8q24 corresponding to the MYCC locus and gains of the long arm
  of chromosome 17 suggestive of isochromosome 17q . While conventional karyotypic
  analysis was not successful in the present case, CGH provided invaluable information
  about gene amplification and losses gains of chromosomes and chromosomal regions.
  Thus, CGH is a powerful technique applicable to frozen or paraffin-embedded material
  which helps to ascertain the presence of gene amplification even without prior knowledge
  of the gene to be tested.
