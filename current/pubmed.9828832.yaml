abstract: 'Non-invasive and invasive papillary transitional cell carcinomas of stages
  pTa and pT1 represent the first steps of tumour progression in bladder cancer. In
  order to analyse different chromosomal alterations of pTa and pT1 superficial bladder
  cancer, 46 tumour specimens were examined by comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . Losses of chromosome 9 material 11 20 and gains of chromosome 17 material 6 20
  were frequently found in pTa tumours. Stage pT1 tumours were characterized by gains
  of chromosome 1q 14 26 including amplification at 1q21-q24 in three cases and chromosome
  17 material 15 26 , as well as by losses of 11p 15 26 and 11q 13 26 . Other loci
  frequently showing losses in pT1 tumours were 2q 9 26 , 4q 10 26 , 5q 9 26 , 8p
  10 26 , 9p 9 26 , 9q 12 26 , 10q 8 26 , 17p 7 26 , and 18q 8 26 . Amplifications
  were detected at 8q21 22, 5q21, 7q36, 10p14, 10p12, 10q25, 12q12, and 12q14. The
  most striking differences between grade 2 pTa and pT1 tumours were gains of 1q P
  amp lt 0.01 and losses at 2q P amp lt 0.025 , 10q P amp lt 0.05 , 11p P amp lt 0.01
  , 11q P amp lt 0.01 , and 17p P amp lt 0.05 , as well as the total number of aberrations
  pTa grade 2: 4.1 pT1 grade 2: 8.6 aberrations per tumour . These data show characteristic
  chromosomal aberrations associated with invasion in superficial bladder cancer.'
