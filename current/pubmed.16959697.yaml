abstract: Matrix-producing bone lesions consist of a wide variety of benign and malignant
  conditions. With respect to morphology, an overlap exists between benign and malignant
  bone tumors that causes difficulties in the final determination of the tumor. This
  study was conducted to show the potential of comparative genomic hybridization as
  a tool in the differential diagnosis of matrix-producing bone lesions. Thirty benign
  bone tumors were evaluated by conventional comparative genomic hybridization. To
  test its diagnostic reliability, 5 additional cases were analyzed, all with differential
  diagnostic difficulties related to morphology and radiology. All were ultimately
  diagnosed as malignant sarcomas, and unbalanced alterations were detected. In contrast
  benign tumors or tumor-like lesions did not reveal any chromosomal alterations.
  Comparative genomic hybridization is a useful adjunct in the complicated differential
  diagnostic algorithms of matrix-producing bone tumors.
