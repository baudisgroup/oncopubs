abstract: We present an unusual renal tumor, which has not been classified under a
  known subtype of renal cell carcinoma RCC and characteristically shows similar histology
  to thyroid follicular carcinoma. The patient was a 32-year-old asymptomatic woman
  who was found to have a kidney mass during her annual physical examination. She
  had no lesions in the thyroid during physical and ultrasound examinations, and there
  was no abnormal thyroid function test. Neither mediastinal nor ovarian abnormalities
  were observed. The resected kidney showed a well-defined nodular tumor measuring
  11.8x8.0x8.0 cm. The mass was protruding into the pelvic cavity with areas of yellowish
  geographic necrosis. Histologically, the tumor showed follicular architectures with
  inspissated colloid-like material in their lumina. No conventional clear cell RCC
  or any other known subtypes of RCC component was observed. Immunohistochemically,
  the tumor cells showed intensive staining for cytokeratin CK cocktail AE1 AE3 and
  CD10 and were not reactive to thyroid transcription factor-1 and thyroglobulin.
  The staining of CK35betaH11 and vimentin revealed focal cytoplasmic reaction. The
  tumor cells were completely negative for CK7, CK19, CK20, CK34betaE12, carcinoembryonic
  antigen, epithelial membrane antigen, and CD15. Chromosomal gains of 7q36, 8q24,
  12, 16, 17p11-q11, 17q24, 19q, 20q13, 21q22.3, and Xp and losses of 1p36, 3, and
  9q21-33 were detected by comparative genomic hybridization. These findings are dissimilar
  to previously classified renal neoplasm. Only a report that included three cases
  of primary thyroid-like renal tumor has been described in the abstract form. However,
  there is no fully documented case on this unusual form of RCC, which morphologically
  resembles that of thyroid follicular carcinoma. Herein, we present a new case of
  thyroid follicular carcinoma-like tumor of the kidney with a chromosomal study and
  review of the literature.
