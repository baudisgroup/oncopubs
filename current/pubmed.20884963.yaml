abstract: Alterations of the p53 pathway are among the most frequent aberrations observed
  in human cancers. We have performed an exhaustive analysis of TP53, p14, p15, and
  p16 status in a large series of 143 soft tissue sarcomas, rare tumors accounting
  for around 1 of all adult cancers, with complex genetics. For this purpose, we performed
  genomic studies, combining sequencing, copy number assessment, and expression analyses.
  TP53 mutations and deletions are more frequent in leiomyosarcomas than in undifferentiated
  pleomorphic sarcomas. Moreover, 50 of leiomyosarcomas present TP53 biallelic inactivation,
  whereas most undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas retain one wild-type TP53 allele
  87.2 . The spectrum of mutations between these two groups of sarcomas is different,
  particularly with a higher rate of complex mutations in undifferentiated pleomorphic
  sarcomas. Most tumors without TP53 alteration exhibit a deletion of p14 and or lack
  of mRNA expression, suggesting that p14 loss could be an alternative genotype for
  direct TP53 inactivation. Nevertheless, the fact that even in tumors altered for
  TP53, we could not detect p14 protein suggests that other p14 functions, independent
  of p53, could be implicated in sarcoma oncogenesis. In addition, both p15 and p16
  are frequently codeleted or transcriptionally co-inhibited with p14, essentially
  in tumors with two wild-type TP53 alleles. Conversely, in TP53-altered tumors, p15
  and p16 are well expressed, a feature not incompatible with an oncogenic process.
