abstract: DNA copy number changes were studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  on 10 tumor specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of cervix obtained from Korean
  patients. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded sections after removal of non-malignant
  cells by microdissection technique. Copy number changes were found in 8 10 tumors.
  The most frequent changes were chromosome 19 gains n 6 and losses on chromosomes
  4 n 4 , 5 n 3 , and 3p n 3 . A novel finding was amplification in chromosome arm
  9p21-pter in 2 cases. Gains in 1, 3q, 5p, 6p, 8q, 16p, 17, and 20q and losses at
  2q, 6q, 8p, 9q, 10p, 11, 13, 16q, and 18q were observed in at least one of the cases.
