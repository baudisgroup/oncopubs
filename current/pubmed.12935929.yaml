abstract: Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis of 79 childhood acute lymphoblastic
  leukemias ALL revealed chromosomal abnormalities in 76 96 . Complex karyotypes a
  finding of three and more chromosomal aberrations in a karyotype were identified
  in 21 26.6 out of 79 patients. In 11 patients, complex karyotypes have included
  common recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocation t 12 21 in seven
  cases, t 9 22 in two cases, one case with t 2 1 19 and another one with translocation
  involving 11q23. In 10 patients, miscellaneous abnormalities were detected. Five
  patients displayed hyperdiploidy 47 approximately 57 chromosomes , three patients
  complex karyotypes with deletions of 9p, one patient with two new complex translocations
  t 2 4 12 13 and t 7 11 20 , and the last patient with dic 12 21 . The evaluation
  of the frequency of the chromosomal breaks amp gt 5 per chromosome showed that chromosomes
  2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 21 were most frequently affected. Survival analysis revealed
  statistically significant unfavorable event-free survival EFS P 0.013 and decreased
  overall survival in the group with complex karyotypes n 21 compared with the other
  cases n 58 . The evaluation of overexpression profile revealed increased occurrence
  of double CD13 CD33 positivity in patients with common recurrent chromosomal abnormalities
  in 70 of cases no such cases were registered in the other group P amp lt 0.01 .
