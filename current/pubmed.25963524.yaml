abstract: Unlike patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningiomas,
  which are considered benign, patients with WHO grade III meningiomas have very high
  mortality rates. The principles underlying tumor progression in meningioma are largely
  unknown, yet a detailed understanding of these mechanisms will be required for effective
  management of patients with these high grade lethal tumors. We present a case of
  an intraventricular meningioma that at first presentation displayed remarkable morphologic
  heterogeneity-composed of distinct regions independently fulfilling histopathologic
  criteria for WHO grade I, II, and III designations. The lowest grade regions had
  classic meningothelial features, while the highest grade regions were markedly dedifferentiated.
  Whereas progression in meningiomas is generally observed during recurrence following
  radiation and systemic medical therapies, the current case offers us a snapshot
  of histologic progression and intratumoral heterogeneity in a native pretreatment
  context. Using whole exome sequencing and high resolution array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization, we observed marked genetic heterogeneity between the various
  areas. Notably, in the higher grade regions we found increased aneuploidy with progressive
  loss of heterozygosity, the emergence of mutations in the TERT promoter, and compromise
  of ARID1A. These findings provide new insights into intratumoral heterogeneity in
  the evolution of malignant phenotypes in anaplastic meningiomas and potential pathways
  of malignant progression.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
