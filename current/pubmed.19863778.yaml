abstract: The active form of Vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 1,25D , has strong
  anti-proliferative effects, yet the molecular mechanisms underneath this effect
  remain unclear. In contrast, the molecular mechanism of 1,25D for the regulation
  of calcium homeostasis has principally been resolved, demonstrating a pivotal role
  for the vitamin D receptor VDR .
