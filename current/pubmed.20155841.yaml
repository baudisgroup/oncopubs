abstract: Lobular intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 LIN3 is a recently recognized
  variant of intraepithelial lobular neoplasia LIN of the breast composed of either
  uniform, generally small cells with massive lobular distension, pleomorphic cells,
  signet-ring cells, or any cell type with necrosis. In contrast to classic forms
  of LIN, there is no consensus on therapeutic strategies for LIN3. In part this is
  due to the paucity of molecular data that could assist in defining the relationship
  of LIN3 to classic LIN and carcinomas. In this study we have employed array comparative
  genomic hybridization to determine the patterns of chromosomal aberrations in nine
  LIN3 lesions. By comparison to array CGH data of 13 classic LIN lesions, we demonstrate
  that classic LIN and LIN3 share several recurrent changes, in particular gains of
  1q and losses of 16q. Both aberrations are known to appear early in tumorigenesis
  and to be associated with good prognosis. However, apart from this overlap, there
  were a number of karyotypic features that were observed exclusively in LIN3. Clearly,
  this lesion was characterized by a significantly higher number of DNA copy number
  changes 9 vs. 31 on average , a considerable complexity of chromosomal rearrangements
  with more than 16 breakpoints in one chromosome and overlapping high copy amplifications
  encompassing a number of known oncogenes. Our data suggest that, at the genetic
  level, LIN3 represents a highly advanced lesion with considerable resemblance to
  carcinomas and, therefore, might represent the transition state from an intraepithelial
  neoplasm to breast carcinoma.
