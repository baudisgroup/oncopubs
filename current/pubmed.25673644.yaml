abstract: BRAF mutations occur in approximately 10% of colorectal cancers. Although
  RAF inhibitor monotherapy is highly effective in BRAF-mutant melanoma, response
  rates in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer are poor. Recent clinical trials of combined
  RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK inhibition have produced improved efficacy, but patients ultimately
  develop resistance. To identify molecular alterations driving clinical acquired
  resistance, we performed whole-exome sequencing on paired pretreatment and postprogression
  tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer treated with RAF
  inhibitor combinations. We identified alterations in MAPK pathway genes in resistant
  tumors not present in matched pretreatment tumors, including KRAS amplification,
  BRAF amplification, and a MEK1 mutation. These alterations conferred resistance
  to RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK combinations through sustained MAPK pathway activity, but
  an ERK inhibitor could suppress MAPK activity and overcome resistance. Identification
  of MAPK pathway reactivating alterations upon clinical acquired resistance underscores
  the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and suggests
  therapeutic options to overcome resistance.  RAF inhibitor combinations represent
  promising approaches in clinical development for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.
  Initial characterization of clinical acquired resistance mechanisms to these regimens
  identified several MAPK pathway alterations driving resistance by reactivating MAPK
  signaling, highlighting the critical dependence of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers
  on MAPK signaling and offering potential strategies to overcome resistance. Cancer
