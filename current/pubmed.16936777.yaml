abstract: 'A series of studies have been published that evaluate the chromosomal copy
  number changes of different tumor classes using array comparative genomic hybridization
  (array CGH); however, the chromosomal aberrations that distinguish the different
  tumor classes have not been fully characterized. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis
  of different array CGH data sets in an attempt to classify samples tested across
  different platforms. As opposed to RNA expression, a common reference is used in
  dual channel CGH arrays: normal human DNA, theoretically facilitating cross-platform
  analysis. To this aim, cell line and primary cancer data sets from three different
  dual channel array CGH platforms obtained by four different institutes were integrated.
  The cell line data were used to develop preprocessing methods, which performed noise
  reduction and transformed samples into a common format. The transformed array CGH
  profiles allowed perfect clustering by cell line, but importantly not by platform
  or institute. The same preprocessing procedures used for the cell line data were
  applied to data from 373 primary tumors profiled by array CGH, including controls.
  Results indicated that there is no apparent feature related to the institute or
  platform and that array CGH allows for unambiguous cross-platform meta-analysis.
  Major clusters with common tissue origin were identified. Interestingly, tumors
  of hematopoietic and mesenchymal origins cluster separately from tumors of epithelial
  origin. Therefore, it can be concluded that chromosomal aberrations of tumors from
  hematopoietic and mesenchymal origin versus tumors of epithelial origin are distinct,
  and these differences can be picked up by meta-analysis of array CGH data. This
  suggests the possibility of prospectively using combined analysis of diverse copy
  number data sets for cancer subtype classification.'
