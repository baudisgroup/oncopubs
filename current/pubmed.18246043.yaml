abstract: 'Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are low-grade malignancies,
  but their biological behavior cannot be stratified solely on the basis of histopathologic
  criteria. Aside from mutations in beta-catenin and lack of genetic changes common
  to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, little is known about the chromosomal alterations
  in solid pseudopapillary neoplasms. We applied array comparative genomic hybridization
  to a series of 12 patients. The average age was 31 years range 12-52 years with
  10 female and 2 male patients. The average tumor size was 7.3 cm range 2-24 cm with
  five lesions greater than 5 cm. All cases had bland cytology without significant
  pleomorphism or high nuclear grade, but seven cases demonstrated at least one of
  these potentially aggressive histopathologic features: size amp gt 5 cm, tumor necrosis,
  lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and peripancreatic invasion. Clinically,
  one lesion demonstrated aggressive behavior. By array comparative genomic hybridization,
  chromosomal losses and or gains were identified in eight cases five cases had multiple
  five or more alterations. The most common alterations were gains at 13q, 17q, 1q
  and 8q. Six of the seven cases with at least one aggressive feature had genetic
  alterations, while only two cases without adverse features had genetic alterations
  P 0.024 . The single clinically aggressive tumor exhibited seven chromosomal gains
  and four aggressive histopathologic features. Our study demonstrates that genetic
  alterations detected by array comparative genomic hybridization are common in solid
  pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas. Additional study and longer follow-up
  are needed to determine if these genetic abnormalities could help predict clinical
  behavior in these neoplasms.'
