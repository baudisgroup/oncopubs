abstract: 'Therapy-related acute leukemia t-AML , is a severe complication of cytotoxic
  therapy used for primary cancer treatment. The outcome of these patients is poor,
  compared to people who develop de novo acute leukemia p-AML . Cytogenetic abnormalities
  in t-AML are similar to those found in p-AML but present more frequent unfavorable
  karyotypes depending on the inducting agent. Losses of chromosome 5 or 7 are observed
  after alkylating agents while balanced translocations are found after topoisomerase
  II inhibitors. This study compared t-AML to p-AML using high resolution array CGH
  in order to find copy number abnormalities CNA at a higher resolution than conventional
  cytogenetics. More CNAs were observed in 30 t-AML than in 36 p-AML: 104 CNAs were
  observed with 63 losses and 41 gains mean number 3.46 per case in t-AML, while in
  p-AML, 69 CNAs were observed with 32 losses and 37 gains mean number of 1.9 per
  case . In primary leukemia with a previously amp quot normal amp quot karyotype,
  18 exhibited a previously undetected CNA, whereas in the few t-AML with a normal
  karyotype, the rate was 50 . Several minimal critical regions MCRs were found in
  t-AML and p-AML. No common MCRs were found in the two groups. In t-AML a 40 kb deleted
  MCR pointed to RUNX1 on 21q22, a gene coding for a transcription factor implicated
  in frequent rearrangements in leukemia and in familial thrombocytopenia. In de novo
  AML, a 1 Mb MCR harboring ERG and ETS2 was observed from patients with complex aCGH
  profiles. High resolution cytogenomics obtained by aCGH and similar techniques already
  published allowed us to characterize numerous non random chromosome abnormalities.
  This work supports the hypothesis that they can be classified into several categories:
  abnormalities common to all AML those more frequently found in t-AML and those specifically
  found in p-AML.'
