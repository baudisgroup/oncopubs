abstract: The technology of array comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH aCGH
  enabled the identification of novel genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
  CLL including the monoallelic and biallelic deletions affecting 22q11 locus. In
  contrast to previous publications, we hypothesized that the described 22q11 deletions
  are a consequence of the rearrangement of immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus
  IGL segments surrounding several protein-coding genes located in this region. Indeed,
  using array-CGH and PCR analysis we show that all deletions n 7 affecting the 22q11
  locus in our cohort n 40 are based on the physiological mechanism of IGL rearrangement.
  This demonstrates that this loss of genetic material is likely not pathogenic and
  in fact is merely a marker of IGL rearrangement.
