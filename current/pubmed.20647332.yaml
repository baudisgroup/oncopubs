abstract: Barretts esophagus BE is a premalignant intermediate to esophageal adenocarcinoma,
  which develops in the context of chronic inflammation and exposure to bile and acid.
  We asked whether there might be common genomic alterations that could be identified
  as potential clinical biomarker s for BE by whole genome profiling. We detected
  copy number alterations and or loss of heterozygosity at 56 fragile sites in 20
  patients with premalignant BE. Chromosomal fragile sites are particularly sensitive
  to DNA breaks and are frequent sites of rearrangement or loss in many human cancers.
  Seventy-eight percent of all genomic alterations detected by array-CGH were associated
  with fragile sites. Copy number losses in early BE were observed at particularly
  high frequency at FRA3B 81 , FRA9A C 71.4 , FRA5E 52.4 , and FRA 4D 52.4 , and at
  lower frequencies in other fragile sites, including FRA1K 42.9 , FRAXC 42.9 , FRA
  12B 33.3 , and FRA16D 33.3 . Due to the consistency of the region of copy number
  loss, we were able to verify these results by quantitative PCR, which detected the
  loss of FRA3B and FRA16D, in 83 and 40 of early molecular stage BE patients, respectively.
  Loss of heterozygosity in these cases was confirmed through pyrosequencing at FRA3B
  and FRA16D 75 and 70 , respectively . Deletion and genomic instability at FRA3B
  and other fragile sites could thus be a biomarker of genetic damage in BE patients
  and a potential biomarker of cancer risk.
