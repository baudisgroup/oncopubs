abstract: The prognosis of germinal center-derived B-cell GCB lymphomas, including
  follicular lymphoma and diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma DLBCL , strongly depends on
  age. Children have a more favorable outcome than adults. It is not known whether
  this is because of differences in host characteristics, treatment protocols, or
  tumor biology, including the presence of chromosomal alterations. By screening for
  novel IGH translocation partners in pediatric and adult lymphomas, we identified
  chromosomal translocations juxtaposing the IRF4 oncogene next to one of the immunoglobulin
  IG loci as a novel recurrent aberration in mature B-cell lymphoma. FISH revealed
  20 of 427 lymphomas to carry an IG IRF4-fusion. Those were predominantly GCB-type
  DLBCL or follicular lymphoma grade 3, shared strong expression of IRF4 MUM1 and
  BCL6, and lacked PRDM1 BLIMP1 expression and t 14 18 BCL2 breaks. BCL6 aberrations
  were common. The gene expression profile of IG IRF4-positive lymphomas differed
  from other subtypes of DLBCL. A classifier for IG IRF4 positivity containing 27
  genes allowed accurate prediction. IG IRF4 positivity was associated with young
  age and a favorable outcome. Our results suggest IRF4 translocations to be primary
  alterations in a molecularly defined subset of GCB-derived lymphomas. The probability
  for this subtype of lymphoma significantly decreases with age, suggesting that diversity
  in tumor biology might contribute to the age-dependent differences in prognosis
  of lymphoma.
