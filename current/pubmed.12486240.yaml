abstract: In vitro data show that the adenomatous polyposis coli APC protein associates
  with the mitotic spindle and that mouse embryonic stem cells with biallelic Apc
  mutations are karyotypically unstable. These findings led to suggestions that APC
  acts in chromosomal segregation and that APC inactivation leads to chromosomal instability
  CIN . An alternative hypothesis based on allelic loss studies in colorectal adenomas
  proposes that CIN precedes and contributes to genetic changes at APC. We determined
  whether colorectal adenomas with two mutations at APC show features consistent with
  these models by studying 55 lesions average size 5 mm range 1-13 mm from patients
  with familial adenomatous polyposis. A variety of methods was used depending on
  available material, including flow cytometry, comparative genomic hybridization,
  and loss of heterozygosity LOH analysis. Selected adenomas were assessed for proliferative
  activity by Ki-67 immunocytochemistry. Seventeen of 20 85 tumors were diploid, two
  were near-diploid, and one was hypotetraploid. Just one near-diploid tumor showed
  increased proliferative activity. LOH was found occasionally on chromosome 15q 2
  of 49 tumors , but not on chromosome 18q 0 of 48 . In 20 adenomas, LOH at APC was
  associated with loss at 5q but not 5p markers, with the former encompassing a minimum
  of 20 Mb. However, three of these lesions analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  displayed normal profiles, suggesting, together with other data, that the mechanism
  of LOH at APC is probably somatic recombination. Our results therefore do not support
  the hypothesis that CIN precedes APC mutations in tumorigenesis. Regarding the model
  in which APC mutations lead directly to CIN, if APC mutations do have this effect
  in vivo, it must be subtle. Alternatively, CIN associated with APC mutations might
  be essentially an in vitro phenomenon.
