abstract: Our aim was to examine the genetics of clonal evolution in follicular lymphoma
  FL and to identify genetic alterations associated with disease progression. A total
  of 100 biopsies from 44 patients diagnosed with t 14 18 -positive FL were examined
  by array comparative genomic hybridization. In 20 patients the patterns of somatic
  hypermutations SHMs in the variable region of heavy chain gene were additionally
  analyzed. Gain of chromosome X in male samples was a marker for poor outcome P amp
  lt .01 . Gains involving chromosome 2, 3q, and 5 were exclusively present in FL
  biopsies from cases with higher grade transformation and were among the copy number
  alterations CNAs associated with inferior survival. Although we noted a trend for
  increasing genomic complexity in initial versus late FL samples, the overall frequencies
  of CNAs in initial and late FL biopsies showed a surprisingly stable pattern through
  the course of the disease. In 27 of cases the initial samples harbored CNAs that
  were absent in relapse samples, indicating that tumor cell clones at relapse were
  not direct descendants of initially dominating clones. The pattern of SHMs confirmed
  parallel development of tumor cell clones in 14 cases. Our findings support the
  hypothesis of common progenitor cells in FL.
