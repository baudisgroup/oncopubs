abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was utilized to investigate genetic
  changes from archived cases of choriocarcinoma n 12 and hydatidiform moles n 7 .
  Test DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, amplified using total universal
  PCR, and co-hybridized with control DNA to normal metaphases. Comparative genomic
  hybridization findings showed chromosomal imbalances in 9 of 12 cases of choriocarcinoma.
  By contrast, all hydatidiform moles showed normal CGH profiles. Consistent findings
  in choriocarcinoma included deletion at 8p 5 cases and amplification at 7q 4 cases
  . A tumor suppressor gene e.g., N33 at 8p and or a growth regulator at 7q could
  play a role in the initiation of choriocarcinoma and its progression. This is the
  first study showing specific alterations in choriocarcinomas by CGH, and illustrates
  the utility of this technique in elucidating genetic changes in gynecological tumors.
