abstract: 'Oncogene-expressing human papillomavirus type 16 HPV16 is found in a subset
  of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas HNSCC . HPV16 drives carcinogenesis by
  inactivating p53 and pRb with the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, paralleled by a
  low level of mutations in TP53 and allelic loss at 3p, 9p, and 17p, genetic changes
  frequently found in HNSCCs of nonviral etiology. We hypothesize that two pathways
  to HNSCC exist: one determined by HPV16 and the other by environmental carcinogens.
  To define the critical genetic events in these two pathways, we now present a detailed
  genome analysis of HNSCC with and without HPV16 involvement by employing high-resolution
  microarray comparative genomic hybridization. Four regions showed alterations in
  HPV-negative tumors that were absent in HPV-positive tumors: losses at 3p11.2-26.3,
  5q11.2-35.2, and 9p21.1-24, and gains amplifications at 11q12.1-13.4. Also, HPV16-negative
  tumors demonstrated loss at 18q12.1-23, in contrast to gain in HPV16-positive tumors.
  Seven regions were altered at high frequency amp gt 33 in both groups: gains at
  3q22.2-qter, 5p15.2-pter, 8p11.2-qter, 9q22-34.1, and 20p-20q, and losses at 11q14.1-qter
  and 13q11-33. These data show that HNSCC arising by environmental carcinogens are
  characterized by genetic alterations that differ from those observed in HPV16-induced
  HNSCC, and most likely occur early in carcinogenesis. A number of genetic changes
  are shared in both tumor groups and can be considered crucial in the later stages
  of HNSCC progression.'
