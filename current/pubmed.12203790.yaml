abstract: To elucidate the relationship between genomewide DNA hypomethylation and
  chromosome instability, 55 prostate carcinoma specimens were analyzed for extent
  of hypomethylation by Southern blot analysis of LINE-1 sequence methylation and
  for loss or gain of chromosomal material by comparative genomic hybridization. Seventeen
  31 tumors showed strong hypomethylation of DNA, whereas four 7 displayed slight
  hypomethylation and the rest of the tumors normal-level methylation. Chromosomal
  aberrations were observed in 34 carcinomas. The most frequent chromosomal alterations
  were loss of 13q in 18 cases and aberrations in 8p loss or 8q gain in 16 cases.
  The presence of chromosomal loss or gain was significantly associated with the presence
  of strong hypomethylation. A striking correlation P 0.00001 was observed between
  aberrations on chromosome 8 and hypomethylation, whereas no association was seen
  between DNA hypomethylation and loss of 13q. The association between DNA hypomethylation
  and the presence of metastases was statistically significant P 0.044 , and both
  chromosomal alterations and DNA hypomethylation tended to be more frequent in higher-stage
  tumors. In conclusion, the data indicate that hypomethylation is associated with
  chromosomal instability in prostate cancer. Specifically, a surprisingly strong
  association between alterations on chromosome 8 and genomewide hypomethylation was
  found. This association suggests that DNA hypomethylation and alterations in chromosome
  8 may be mechanistically linked to each other in prostate carcinoma.
