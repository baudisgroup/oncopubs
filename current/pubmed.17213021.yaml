abstract: Genomic copy number changes are detectable in many malignancies, including
  neuroblastoma, using techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization CGH ,
  microsatellite analysis, conventional karyotyping, and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH . We report the use of 10K single nucleotide polymorphism SNP microarrays to
  detect copy number changes and allelic imbalance in six neuroblastoma cell lines
  IMR32, SHEP, NBL-S, SJNB-1, LS, and SKNBE2c . SNP data were generated using the
  GeneChip DNA Analysis and GeneChip chromosome copy number software Affymetrix .
  SNP arrays confirmed the presence of all previously reported cytogenetic abnormalities
  in the cell lines, including chromosome 1p deletion, MYCN amplification, gain of
  17q and 11q, and 14q deletions. In addition, the SNP arrays revealed several chromosome
  gains and losses not detected by CGH or karyotyping these included gain of 8q21.1
  approximately 24.3 and gain of chromosome 12 in IMR-32 cells loss at 4p15.3 approximately
  16.1 and loss at 16p12.3 approximately 13.2, 11q loss with loss of heterozygosity
  LOH at 11q14.3 approximately 23.3 in SJNB-1 cells and loss at 8p21.2 approximately
  23.3 and 9p21.3 approximately 22.1 with corresponding LOH in SHEP cells. The SNP
  arrays refined the mapping of the 2p amplicons in LS, BE2c, and IMR-32 cell lines,
  the 12q amplicon in LS cells, and also identified an 11q13 amplicon in LS cells.
  There was good concordance among SNP arrays, CGH, and karyotyping. SNP array analysis
  is a powerful tool for the detection of allelic imbalance in neuroblastoma and also
  allows identification of LOH without changes in copy number uniparental disomy .
