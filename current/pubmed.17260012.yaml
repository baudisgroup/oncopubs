abstract: Malignant melanoma is an aggressive, heterogeneous disease where new biomarkers
  for diagnosis and clinical outcome are needed. We searched for chromosomal aberrations
  that characterize its pathogenesis using 47 different melanoma cell lines and tiling-resolution
  bacterial artificial chromosome-arrays for comparative genomic hybridization. Major
  melanoma genes, including BRAF, NRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, CTNNB1, CDK4 and PTEN, were
  examined for mutations. Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including
  loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous
  deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13,
  10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes
  1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF 3p14
  , CCND1 11q13 , MDM2 12q15 , CCNE1 19q12 and NOTCH2 1p12 . Frequent findings of
  homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN.
  Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually
  exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant
  chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and
  20 gain. Moreover, alterations of the various melanoma genes were associated with
  distinct chromosomal imbalances suggestive of specific genomic programs in melanoma
  development.
