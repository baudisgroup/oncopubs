abstract: BACKGROUND:Colorectal cancer CRC is with approximately 1 million cases the
  third most common cancer worldwide. Extensive research is ongoing to decipher the
  underlying genetic patterns with the hope to improve early cancer diagnosis and
  treatment. In this direction, the recent progress in next generation sequencing
  technologies has revolutionized the field of cancer genomics. However, one caveat
  of these studies remains the large amount of genetic variations identified and their
  interpretation.METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Here we present the first work on
  whole exome NGS of primary colon cancers. We performed 454 whole exome pyrosequencing
  of tumor as well as adjacent not affected normal colonic tissue from microsatellite
  stable MSS and microsatellite instable MSI colon cancer patients and identified
  more than 50,000 small nucleotide variations for each tissue. According to predictions
  based on MSS and MSI pathomechanisms we identified eight times more somatic non-synonymous
  variations in MSI cancers than in MSS and we were able to reproduce the result in
  four additional CRCs. Our bioinformatics filtering approach narrowed down the rate
  of most significant mutations to 359 for MSI and 45 for MSS CRCs with predicted
  altered protein functions. In both CRCs, MSI and MSS, we found somatic mutations
  in the intracellular kinase domain of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A, BMPR1A,
  a gene where so far germline mutations are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome,
  and show that the mutations functionally impair the protein function.CONCLUSIONS
  SIGNIFICANCE:We conclude that with deep sequencing of tumor exomes one may be able
  to predict the microsatellite status of CRC and in addition identify potentially
  clinically relevant mutations.
