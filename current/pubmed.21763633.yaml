abstract: Acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia is commonly associated with
  pericentric inversions of chromosome 16, involving the core binding factor beta
  gene CBFB on 16q22 and the myosin heavy chain gene MYH11 on 16p13. The inv 16 p13q22
  results in a fusion gene comprising the 5CBFB gene and the 3MYH11 gene on the short
  arm of chromosome 16. The fusion gene interferes with the normal transcription of
  the CBFA CBFB heterodimer and disrupts myeloid differentiation. The inv 16 is associated
  with a good prognosis. The inv 16 with deletion of the 3CBFB region of the gene
  is a very rare occurrence. Although the number of cases is small, inv 16 with a
  deleted 3CBFB seems to be associated with a poorer prognosis than that generally
  associated with inv 16 . Our patient was a 30-year-old man with newly diagnosed
  acute myeloid leukemia who was found to have a CBFB-MYH11 fusion by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
  chain reaction. The high blast count and lack of differentiation were not typical
  for this entity and suggested clonal progression. The initial karyotype by conventional
  cytogenetic analysis, in all metaphases examined, was 46,XY,del 7 q32 ,del 16 q22
  . Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with a dual-color, break-apart probe
  corresponding to the CBFB gene locus Abbott, Des Plaines, IL showed a derivative
  chromosome 16 resulting from an inversion of the CBFB gene with a deletion of the
  3CBFB probe region. Oligonucleotide array comparative genetic hybridization analysis
  was performed on this patients diagnostic bone marrow DNA referenced to a normal
  male control DNA by using the DNAarray Heme Profile CombiMatrix Diagnostics, Irvine,
  CA microarray. This analysis showed a 1.2 Mb loss of 16q22.1, which did not include
  loss of the 3CBFB gene locus, but rather sequences distal to this locus. The DNAarray
  Heme Profile results illustrate the importance of microarray in the correct identification
  of abnormalities that will affect prognosis.
