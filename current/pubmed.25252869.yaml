abstract: Clonal architecture in myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs is poorly understood.
  Here we report genomic analyses of a patient with primary myelofibrosis PMF transformed
  to secondary acute myeloid leukemia sAML . Whole genome sequencing WGS was performed
  on PMF and sAML diagnosis samples, with skin included as a germline surrogate. Deep
  sequencing validation was performed on the WGS samples and an additional sample
  obtained during sAML remission relapsed PMF. Clustering analysis of 649 validated
  somatic single nucleotide variants revealed four distinct clonal groups, each including
  putative driver mutations. The first group including JAK2 and U2AF1 , representing
  the founding clone, included mutations with high frequency at all three disease
  stages. The second clonal group including MYB was present only in PMF, suggesting
  the presence of a clone that was dispensable for transformation. The third group
  including ASXL1 contained mutations with low frequency in PMF and high frequency
  in subsequent samples, indicating evolution of the dominant clone with disease progression.
  The fourth clonal group including IDH1 and RUNX1 was acquired at sAML transformation
  and was predominantly absent at sAML remission relapsed PMF. Taken together, these
  findings illustrate the complex clonal dynamics associated with disease evolution
  in MPNs and sAML.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 25 September 2014 doi:10.1038
