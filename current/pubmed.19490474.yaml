abstract: Malignant mesotheliomas of the hernial sac are uncommon and only a few cases
  have been diagnosed incidentally during herniorrhaphy procedures. The prognosis
  is poor and patient management is difficult because current treatment modalities
  do little to prolong survival. Molecular markers could be useful to identify potential
  therapeutic targets. Using microarray-comparative genomic hybridization aCGH , two
  cases of peritoneal mesothelioma that were found incidentally at the time of hernia
  repair, were investigated. A high number of genetic aberrations was detected in
  both cases. The gains were prevalent. The tumors showed identical lost regions at
  2q13, 6q25.3, 6q26, 6q26-- amp gt q27, 9q31.1-- amp gt 9q31.3, 10p15.3, 11q13.2,
  13q14.2, 19q13.42-- amp gt q43, and gains at 1p36.33, 3q29, 5p15.33, 7p22.3, 10p15.1--
  amp gt 10p14, 11q13.2, 12q24.23, 12q24.33, 16p13.3, 17p13.3, 18p11.31, 19q13.43,
  21q21.1-- amp gt q21.2, 22q11.1-- amp gt q11.22, Xp21.2, Xq28. Survival was longer
  in the patient with a lower total number of genetic defects. aCGH provides a high-resolution
  map of copy number changes that may be critical to mesothelioma progression.
