abstract: All colorectal cancer cell lines except RKO displayed active Î²-catenin/TCF
  regulated transcription. This feature of RKO was noted in familial colon cancers;
  hence our aim was to dissect its carcinogenic mechanism. MFISH and CGH revealed
  distinct instability of chromosome structure in RKO. Gene expression microarray
  of RKO versus 7 colon cancer lines (with active Wnt signaling) and 3 normal specimens
  revealed 611 differentially expressed genes. The majority of the tested gene loci
  were susceptible to LOH in primary tumors with various Î²-catenin localizations
  as a surrogate marker for Î²-catenin activation. The immunohistochemistry of selected
  genes (IFI16, RGS4, MCTP1, DGKI, OBCAM/OPCML, and GLIPR1) confirmed that they were
  differentially expressed in clinical specimens. Since epigenetic mechanisms can
  contribute to expression changes, selected target genes were evaluated for promoter
  methylation in patient specimens from sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancers.
  CMTM3, DGKI, and OPCML were frequently hypermethylated in both groups, whereas KLK10,
  EPCAM, and DLC1 displayed subgroup specificity. The overall fraction of hypermethylated
  genes was higher in tumors with membranous Î²-catenin. We identified novel genes
  in colorectal carcinogenesis that might be useful in personalized tumor profiling.
  Tumors with inactive Wnt signaling are a heterogeneous group displaying interaction
  of chromosomal instability, Wnt signaling, and epigenetics.
