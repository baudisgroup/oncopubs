abstract: We used two molecular cytogenetic techniques, multicolor fluorescence in
  situ hybridization M-FISH and comparative genomic hybridization CGH , to analyze
  three established lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549, H1650, and SPC-A-1 and primary
  lung adenocarcinoma samples, to identify common chromosomal aberrations. M-FISH
  revealed numerous complex chromosomal rearrangements. Chromosomes 5, 6, 11, 12,
  and 17 were most frequently involved in interchromosomal translocations. CGH revealed
  regions on 1q, 2p, 3q, 5p, 5q, 7p, 8q, 11q, 12q, 14q, 16p, 17p, 19q, 20q, 21q, and
  22q to be commonly overrepresented and regions on 2q, 3p, 4p, 5q, 7q, 8p, 9p, 13q,
  14q, and 17p to be underrepresented. The most common gains were found in 16p13 in
  50 of samples , and 16p13 amplification was associated with relatively poor differentiation
  and late stage. M-FISH and CGH can be a powerful tool in identification of genomic
  alterations in lung cancer, as well as in diagnosis. The overrepresented regions
  may harbor potential candidate genes involved in lung adenocarcinoma pathogenesis.
