abstract: Leiomyosarcoma LMS is a rare type of malignant soft tissue tumor occurring
  predominantly in adults. Up to now only few zytogenetic data resulting from chromosomal
  banding analyses were obtained from this tumor type. In general, highly complex
  karyotypes were observed, but no recurrent chromosomal aberrations could be identified.
  The aim of the present study was to analyze chromosomal imbalances in 14 cases of
  LMS using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Imbalances were detected in all
  cases analyzed, with chromosomal gains occurring more frequently than losses 9.9
  gains case vs. 6.9 losses case, respectively . Chromosome arms predominantly overrepresented
  included Xp 9 14 cases , 5p and 8q 8 14 each , as well as 17p and 17q 6 14 each
  . Nineteen distinct high level amplifications, indicative for the location of relevant
  proto-oncogenes in LMS, were identified in nine different tumors. Interestingly,
  in three cases chromosomal arm 17p was involved. Interphase analysis with probes
  derived from the commonly amplified region 17p11-p12 revealed, that the tre oncogene
  is co-amplified and therefore could play a relevant role in LMS development. With
  regard to losses chromosome 13q was affected in 12 14, 10q in 8 14, and 2p as well
  as 2q in 7 14 tumors, respectively. The frequent deletions of chromosome 13 with
  a minimal affected region 13q14-q15 strongly support preliminary molecular evidence,
  that loss of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene is a critical step in LMS tumorigenesis.
