abstract: A common aim of pharmacogenomic studies that use genome-wide assays on panels
  of cancers is the unbiased discovery of genomic alterations that are associated
  with clinical outcome and drug response. Previous studies of lapatinib, a selective
  dual-kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and HER2 tyrosine
  kinases, have shown predictable relationships between the activity of these target
  genes and response. Under the hypothesis that additional genes may play a role in
  drug sensitivity, a predictive model for lapatinib response was constructed from
  genome-wide DNA copy number data from 24 cancer cell lines. An optimal predictive
  model which consists of aberrations at nine distinct genetic loci, includes gains
  of HER2, EGFR, and loss of CDKN2A. This model achieved an area under the receiver
  operating characteristic curve of approximately 0.85 80 confidence interval, 0.70-0.98
  P amp lt 0.01 , and correctly classified the sensitivity status of 8 of 10 head
  and neck cancer cell lines. This study shows that biomarkers predictive for lapatinib
  sensitivity, including the previously described copy number gains of EGFR and HER2,
  can be discovered using novel genomic assays in an unbiased manner. Furthermore,
  these results show the utility of DNA copy number profiles in pharmacogenomic studies.
