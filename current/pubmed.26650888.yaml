abstract: Investigation of the genetic lesions underlying classical Hodgkin lymphoma
  (CHL) has been challenging due to the rarity of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)
  cells, the pathognomonic neoplastic cells of CHL. In an effort to catalog more comprehensively
  recurrent copy number alterations occurring during oncogenesis, we investigated
  somatic alterations involved in CHL using whole-genome sequencing-mediated copy
  number analysis of purified HRS cells. We performed low-coverage sequencing of small
  numbers of intact HRS cells and paired non-neoplastic B lymphocytes isolated by
  flow cytometric cell sorting from 19 primary cases, as well as two commonly used
  HRS-derived cell lines (KM-H2 and L1236). We found that HRS cells contain strikingly
  fewer copy number abnormalities than CHL cell lines. A subset of cases displayed
  nonintegral chromosomal copy number states, suggesting internal heterogeneity within
  the HRS cell population. Recurrent somatic copy number alterations involving known
  factors in CHL pathogenesis were identified (REL, the PD-1 pathway, and TNFAIP3).
  In eight cases (42%) we observed recurrent copy number loss of chr1:2,352,236-4,574,271,
  a region containing the candidate tumor suppressor TNFRSF14. Using flow cytometry,
  we demonstrated reduced TNFRSF14 expression in HRS cells from 5 of 22 additional
  cases (23%) and in two of three CHL cell lines. These studies suggest that TNFRSF14
  dysregulation may contribute to the pathobiology of CHL in a subset of cases. ï¿½
