abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histologic subtype of lung
  cancer and has a high risk of distant metastasis at every disease stage. We aimed
  to characterize the genomic landscape of LUAD and identify mutation signatures associated
  with tumor progression.We performed an integrative genomic analysis, incorporating
  whole exome sequencing (WES), determination of DNA copy number and DNA methylation,
  and transcriptome sequencing for 101 LUAD samples from the Environment And Genetics
  in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study. We detected driver genes by testing whether
  the nonsynonymous mutation rate was significantly higher than the background mutation
  rate and replicated our findings in public datasets with 724 samples. We performed
  subclonality analysis for mutations based on mutant allele data and copy number
  alteration data. We also tested the association between mutation signatures and
  clinical outcomes, including distant metastasis, survival, and tumor grade. We identified
  and replicated two novel candidate driver genes, POU class 4 homeobox 2 (POU4F2)
  (mutated in 9 [8.9%] samples) and ZKSCAN1 (mutated in 6 [5.9%] samples), and characterized
  their major deleterious mutations. ZKSCAN1 was part of a mutually exclusive gene
  set that included the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway genes BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, MET, and NF1,
  indicating an important driver role for this gene. Moreover, we observed strong
  associations between methylation in specific genomic regions and somatic mutation
  patterns. In the tumor evolution analysis, four driver genes had a significantly
  lower fraction of subclonal mutations (FSM), including TP53 (p = 0.007), KEAP1 (p
  = 0.012), STK11 (p = 0.0076), and EGFR (p = 0.0078), suggesting a tumor initiation
  role for these genes. Subclonal mutations were significantly enriched in APOBEC-related
  signatures (p < 2.5ï¿½10-50). The total number of somatic mutations (p = 0.0039)
  and the fraction of transitions (p = 5.5ï¿½10-4) were associated with increased
  risk of distant metastasis. Our study's limitations include a small number of LUAD
  patients for subgroup analyses and a single-sample design for investigation of subclonality.These
  data provide a genomic characterization of LUAD pathogenesis and progression. The
  distinct clonal and subclonal mutation signatures suggest possible diverse carcinogenesis
  pathways for endogenous and exogenous exposures, and may serve as a foundation for
  more effective treatments for this lethal disease. LUAD's high heterogeneity emphasizes
  the need to further study this tumor type and to associate genomic findings with
  clinical outcomes.
