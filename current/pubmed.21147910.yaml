abstract: Advanced prostate cancer can progress to systemic metastatic tumors, which
  are generally androgen insensitive and ultimately lethal. Here, we report a comprehensive
  genomic survey for somatic events in systemic metastatic prostate tumors using both
  high-resolution copy number analysis and targeted mutational survey of 3508 exons
  from 577 cancer-related genes using next generation sequencing. Focal homozygous
  deletions were detected at 8p22, 10q23.31, 13q13.1, 13q14.11, and 13q14.12. Key
  genes mapping within these deleted regions include PTEN, BRCA2, C13ORF15, and SIAH3.
  Focal high-level amplifications were detected at 5p13.2-p12, 14q21.1, 7q22.1, and
  Xq12. Key amplified genes mapping within these regions include SKP2, FOXA1, and
  AR. Furthermore, targeted mutational analysis of normal-tumor pairs has identified
  somatic mutations in genes known to be associated with prostate cancer including
  AR and TP53, but has also revealed novel somatic point mutations in genes including
  MTOR, BRCA2, ARHGEF12, and CHD5. Finally, in one patient where multiple independent
  metastatic tumors were available, we show common and divergent somatic alterations
  that occur at both the copy number and point mutation level, supporting a model
  for a common clonal progenitor with metastatic tumor-specific divergence. Our study
  represents a deep genomic analysis of advanced metastatic prostate tumors and has
  revealed candidate somatic alterations, possibly contributing to lethal prostate
  cancer.
