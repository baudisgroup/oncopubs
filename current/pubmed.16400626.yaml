abstract: Desmoplastic medulloblastoma DMB is a malignant cerebellar tumour composed
  of two distinct tissue components, pale islands and desmoplastic areas. Previous
  studies revealed mutations in genes encoding members of the sonic hedgehog pathway,
  including PTCH, SMOH and SUFUH in DMBs. However, little is known about other genomic
  aberrations. We performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis of 22 sporadic
  DMBs and identified chromosomal imbalances in 20 tumours 91 mean, 4.9 imbalances
  tumour . Recurrent chromosomal gains were found on chromosomes 3, 9 six tumours
  each , 20, 22 five tumours each , 2, 6, 7, 17 four tumours each and 1 three tumours
  . Recurrent losses involved chromosomes X eight tumours , Y six of eleven tumours
  from male patients , 9, 12 four tumours each , as well as 10, 13 and 17 three tumours
  each . Four tumours demonstrated high-level amplifications involving sequences from
  1p22, 5p15, 9p, 12p13, 13q33-q34 and 17q22-q24, respectively. Further analysis of
  the 9p and 17q22-q24 amplicons by array-based CGH matrix-CGH and candidate gene
  analyses revealed amplification of JMJD2C at 9p24 in one DMB and amplification of
  RPS6KB1, APPBP2, PPM1D and BCAS3 from 17q23 in three DMBs. Among the 17q23 genes,
  RPS6KB1 showed markedly elevated transcript levels as compared to normal cerebellum
  in five of six DMBs and four of five classic medulloblastomas investigated. Finally,
  CGH analysis of microdissected pale islands and desmoplastic areas showed common
  chromosomal imbalances in five of six informative tumours. In summary, we have identified
  several novel genetic alterations in DMBs and provide genetic evidence for a monoclonal
  origin of their different tissue components.
