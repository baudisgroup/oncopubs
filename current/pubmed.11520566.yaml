abstract: We performed CGH analysis on 34 cervical lesions, which included 8 cases
  of koilocytosis, 6 mild dysplasias and 20 moderate dysplasias. Chromosome aberrations
  were detected in 11 cases of which 9 were moderate dysplasias. A total of 55 chromosome
  arms were involved. The most frequent aberrations were losses of 5p and Xq, each
  of which was present in 5 34 cases. Gain of 3q was detected in two moderate dysplasias.
  This aberration is the most frequent copy number change in advanced-stage cervical
  carcinoma. A considerable number of the aberrations found in the preinvasive cases
  of this study are frequently present in invasive cervical tumors. The presence of
  apparently non-random chromosome aberrations in early preinvasive cervical lesions
  has not previously been described.
