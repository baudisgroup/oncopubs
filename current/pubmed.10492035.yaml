abstract: Although recent molecular investigations have identified a number of genetic
  alterations that are associated with the development of pituitary adenomas, the
  exact pathogenesis mechanism of these tumors remains largely unknown. In this study,
  we used a genome-wide survey to detect specific genetic changes within the genome
  of pituitary adenomas. A series of 10 growth hormone-secreting adenomas were analyzed
  for their genetic imbalances on all 22 autosomes by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Chromosomal imbalances were detected in 8 GH-secreting adenomas, whereas 2
  tumors had no detectable genetic abnormalities. Chromosome gains were more frequent
  than losses. Overrepresentation of whole or parts of chromosomes were detected in
  5 10 50 in 19, 3 10 30 in each of 5, 9, and 22q, 2 10 20 in 17p12-q21, whereas DNA
  loss were 3 10 30 in 13q and 2 10 20 in 18. No detectable gain or loss of genetic
  material was observed in chromosomes 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 20. The findings of overrepresentation
  of chromosomes 5q, 9p, 17q and DNA loss of chromosome 18 were consistent with those
  detected in nonfunctioning adenomas Daniely M, Aviram A, Adams EF, et al:J Clin
  Endocrinol Metab 83:1801-1805, 1998 suggesting that the development of pituitary
  tumors, at least in somatotroph and nonfunctioning adenomas, may share common pathway.
  Frequent amplifications in chromosomes 19 and 22q imply that candidate genes residing
  in these chromosomal regions may be involved in the pathogenesis of GH-secreting
  adenomas.
