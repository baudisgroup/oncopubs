abstract: We report serial genetic studies on a young female patient initially diagnosed
  with asymptomatic smouldering myeloma who progressed to symptomatic myeloma 4.5
  years after presentation. An unbalanced translocation, der 14 t 4 14 p16 q32 , was
  initially found in all plasma cells plus deletions of other chromosomal regions
  as detected by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Deletion of chromosome
  13 was observed in a minor population of plasma cells amp lt 20 for the first two
  years, increasing to 100 of plasma cells by the time of multiple myeloma diagnosis.
  Loss of 1p and a rearrangement of MYC were first observed in a small population
  of plasma cells one year prior to the clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma, but
  these subclones increased rapidly in size to become the major population suggesting
  that they were directly involved in the transformation process. This case report
  provides a unique insight into the mechanisms of disease progression from smouldering
  multiple myeloma to multiple myeloma.
