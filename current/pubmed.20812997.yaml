abstract: Approximately 10 of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL have
  a family history of the disease or a related lymphoproliferative disorder, yet the
  relationship of familial CLL to genomic abnormalities has not been characterized
  in detail. We therefore studied 75 CLL patients, half familial and half sporadic,
  using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization CGH , in order to
  better define the relationship of genomic abnormalities to familial disease and
  other biological prognostic factors. Our results showed that the most common high-risk
  deletion in CLL, deletion 11q, was significantly associated with sporadic disease.
  Comparison of familial to sporadic disease additionally identified a copy number
  variant region near the centromere on 14q, proximal to IGH , in which gains were
  associated both with familial CLL, and with mutated IGHV and homozygous deletion
  of 13q. Homozygous deletion of 13q was also found to be associated with mutated
  IGHV and low expression of ZAP-70, and a significantly longer time to first treatment
  compared to heterozygous deletion or lack of alteration. This study is the first
  high resolution effort to investigate and report somatic genetic differences between
  familial and sporadic CLL.
