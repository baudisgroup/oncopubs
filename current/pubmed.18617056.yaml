abstract: Most meningiomas, accounting for about 20 of intracranial tumors, can be
  cured by surgical removal. Yet, 8-22 of these tumors are classified as atypical
  or anaplastic WHO grade II or III, respectively presenting with a more aggressive
  behavior and a high relapse rate. We analyzed genomic alterations of an atypical
  meningioma using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays SNP-A karyotyping
  combined with GTG-banding, multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization M-FISH
  , and locus-specific FISH. In accordance to recent studies applying SNP-A karyotyping
  in different malignancies we found that genomic lesions are present at a higher
  frequency than predicted by traditional cytogenetics. Most of these aberrations
  have not been described before. Additionally, we unveiled loss of heterozygosity
  LOH without copy number changes on chromosome regions 1p31.1, 2p16.1, 2q23.3, 6q14.1,
  6q21, 9p21.1, 10q21.1, and 14q23.3, suggesting partial uniparental disomy UPD .
  UPDs are currently considered to play an important role in the initiation and progression
  of different malignancies. Furthermore, we detected two de novo reciprocal translocations,
  t 8 19 q24 q13 and t 10 16 q22 q12.1 . While GTG-banding and M-FISH data suggested
  balanced translocations, SNP-A analysis clearly demonstrated imbalances in the same
  region.
