abstract: 'The molecular basis of parathyroid adenomatosis includes defects in the
  cyclin D1 PRAD1 and MEN1 genes but is, in large part, unknown. To identify new locations
  of parathyroid oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, and to further establish the
  importance of DNA losses described by molecular allelotyping, we performed comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH on a panel of 53 typical sporadic nonfamilial parathyroid
  adenomas. CGH is a new molecular cytogenetic technique in which the entire tumor
  genome is screened for chromosomal gains and or losses. Two abnormalities, not previously
  described, were found recurrently: gain of chromosome 16p 6 of 53 tumors, or 11
  and gain of chromosome 19p 5 of 53, or 9 . Losses were found frequently on 11p 14
  of 53, or 26 , as well as 11q 18 of 53, or 34 . Recurrent losses were also seen
  on chromosomes 1p, 1q, 6q, 9p, 9q, 13q, and 15q, with frequencies ranging from 8-19
  . Twenty-four of the 53 adenomas were also extensively analyzed with polymorphic
  microsatellite markers for allelic losses, either in this study 11 cases or previously
  13 cases . Molecular allelotyping results were highly concordant with CGH results
  in these tumors concordance level of 97.5 for all informative markers chromosome
  arms examined . In conclusion, CGH has identified the first two known chromosomal
  gain defects in parathyroid adenomas, suggesting the existence of direct-acting
  parathyroid oncogenes on chromosomes 16 and 19. CGH has confirmed the locations
  of putative parathyroid tumor suppressor genes, also defined by molecular allelotyping,
  on chromosomes 1p, 6q, 9p, 11q, 13q, and 15q. Finally, CGH has provided new evidence
  favoring the possibility that distinct parathyroid tumor suppressors exist on 1p
  and 1q, and has raised the possibility of a parathyroid tumor suppressor gene on
  11p, distinct from the MEN1 gene on 11q. CGH can identify recurrent genetic abnormalities
  in hyperparathyroidism, especially chromosomal gains, that other methods to not
  detect.'
