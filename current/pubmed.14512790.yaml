abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization was used to map copy number abnormalities
  in 48 short-term cell cultures established from different stages and types of human
  melanoma. A variety of random and non-random chromosomal alterations were detected,
  with gains within chromosomes 20q, 7q, 7p, 20p, 6p and 17q and losses in 9p, 10q,
  6q, 10p, 4q, and 11q being the most common observations. In addition, several other
  chromosomal loci were over- or under-represented in subgroups of melanomas. For
  example, sequences on 3q26 were over-represented in 33 and on 5p15.33 in 27 of cell
  cultures, reaching the level of amplification in 12 and 22 , respectively. These
  regions harbour the two essential genes for the enzyme telomerase: the telomerase
  reverse transcriptase gene hTERT on 5p15.33 and the telomerase RNA component gene
  hTERC on 3q26. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis,
  both genes were shown to be over-represented or amplified in several melanomas.
  Interestingly, hTERT amplification was abundant in superficial spreading primary
  melanomas, subcutaneous metastases and malignant effusion-derived cells, but completely
  absent or very rare in primary nodular melanomas as well as brain, bone and lymph
  node metastases. Several chromosomes or chromosomal regions harbouring telomerase-suppressing
  activities 3p, 4, 6 and 10p were frequently under-represented in melanomas. Our
  data suggest that genetic alterations at several chromosomal loci might facilitate
  activation of telomerase during the development of cutaneous malignant melanoma.'
