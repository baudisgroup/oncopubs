abstract: Low-grade noninvasive papillary bladder tumors are genetically stable whereas
  muscle invasive bladder tumors display high levels of chromosomal aberrations. As
  cells deficient for nonhomologous end-joining NHEJ pathway components display increased
  genomic instability, we sought to determine the NHEJ repair characteristics of bladder
  tumors and correlate this with tumor stage and grade. A panel of 13 human bladder
  tumors of defined stage and grade were investigated for chromosomal aberrations
  by comparative genomic hybridization and for NHEJ repair fidelity and function.
  Repair assays were conducted with extracts made directly from bladder tumor specimens
  to avoid culture-induced phenotypic alterations and selection bias as only a minority
  of bladder tumors grow in culture. Four noninvasive bladder tumors pTaG2 , which
  were genetically stable, repaired a partially incompatible double-strand break DSB
  by NHEJ-dependent annealing of termini and fill-in of overhangs with minimal loss
  of nucleotides. In contrast, four muscle invasive bladder cancers pT2-3G3 , which
  displayed gross chromosomal rearrangements, repaired DSBs in an error-prone manner
  involving extensive resection and microhomology association. Four minimally invasive
  bladder cancers pT1G3 had characteristics of both repair types. Error-prone repair
  in bladder tumors correlated with reduced KU DNA-binding and loss of TP53 function.
  In conclusion, there were distinct differences in DSB repair between noninvasive
  papillary tumors and higher stage grade invasive cancers. End-joining fidelity correlated
  with stage and was increasingly error-prone as tumors became more invasive and KU
  binding activity reduced these changes may underlie the different genomic profiles
  of these tumors.
