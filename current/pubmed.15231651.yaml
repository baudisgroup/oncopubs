abstract: Genomic analyses aimed at the detection of high-level DNA amplifications
  were performed on 13 widely used pancreatic cancer cell lines and 6 pancreatic tumor
  specimens. For these analyses, array-based comparative genomic hybridization Matrix-CGH
  onto dedicated microarrays was used. In comparison with chromosomal CGH eight amplifications
  , a amp gt 3-fold number of DNA amplifications was detected n 29 . The most frequent
  amplifications mapped to 7p12.3 three pancreatic cancer cell lines and three pancreatic
  tumor specimens , 8q24 four pancreatic cancer cell lines and one pancreatic tumor
  specimen , 11q13 three pancreatic cancer cell lines and three pancreatic tumor specimens
  , and 20q13 four pancreatic cancer cell lines and three pancreatic tumor specimens
  . Genes contained in the consensus regions were MYC 8q24 , EGFR 7p12.3 , and FGF3
  11q13 . In six of seven pancreatic cancer cell lines and pancreatic tumor specimens
  with 20q13 amplifications, the novel candidate gene NFAT C2, which plays a role
  in the activation of cytokines, was amplified. Other amplifications also affected
  genes for which a pathogenetic role in pancreatic carcinoma has not been described,
  such as BCL10 and BCL6, two members of the BCL family. A subset of amplified genes
  was checked for overexpression by means of real-time PCR, revealing the highest
  expression levels for BCL6 and BCL10. Thus, Matrix-CGH allows the detection of a
  high number of amplifications, resulting in the identification of novel candidate
  genes in pancreatic cancer.
