abstract: Hereditary intestinal cancers mainly occur in the framework of the familial
  adenomatous polyposis FAP and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer HNPCC syndromes.
  However, in about 50 of young patients with intestinal cancer clinically suspicious
  of an inherited cancer predisposition, no underlying molecular alteration can be
  identified. To determine the genetic profile of early onset intestinal cancer in
  the absence of a known cancer predisposition, we have analyzed 12 small and large
  intestinal tumors from 11 non-FAP, non-HNPCC, and noninflammatory bowel disease
  patients diagnosed under the age of 35years using a combination of comparative genomic
  hybridization and loss of heterozygosity LOH analysis. The distribution of chromosomal
  gains and deletions was similar to late onset carcinomas except for 6q alterations
  which were found in 50 of carcinomas. To define a shared region affected by allelic
  imbalance, detailed LOH analysis at chromosome 6 was performed on three carcinomas
  from two patients which showed small interstitial 6q deletions. A minimal area of
  deletion overlap between markers D6S1652 and D6S1657 6q14-22 was identified. In
  a patient with small and large intestinal carcinoma and seven adenomas, loss of
  identical parental 6q14-22 alleles was seen in both carcinomas and in three of the
  adenomas. Our data indicate that alterations affecting 6q are frequent in early
  onset intestinal carcinomas. Moreover, deletions of identical parental alleles in
  a 35 Mbp area at 6q in multiple independent tumors from one of the patients are
  compatible with the existence of a novel 6q-associated cancer susceptibility syndrome.
