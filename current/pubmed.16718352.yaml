abstract: Ependymoblastomas are very rare and highly malignant embryonal tumours of
  the central nervous system with distinctive multilayered rosettes being the main
  histopathological feature. They are a diagnostically challenging subtype of embryonal
  tumours, whose genetic features are unknown. Primary ependymoblastomas from four
  children one boy, three girls mean age 24.8 months, range 4-41 months were investigated
  by comparative genomic hybridisation CGH , to our knowledge constituting the only
  cohort of this entity studied by cytogenetic means. DNA copy number changes were
  found in each case, consisting mainly of gains of chromosome 2 as well as losses
  of chromosomes 6q and 13q 75 each . The tumours showed between one and five aberrations
  with a mean of 3.25 DNA copy number changes per case, with gains being less frequent
  than losses 1.25 gains vs 2 losses per case . The youngest patient showed the least
  imbalances one , whereas the oldest child presented with the most aberrations five
  . Clinical follow-up data were available for three of the four patients. All three
  had died of their disease after a post-operative survival of 9 months range 6-14
  months . Our CGH data suggest that ependymoblastomas show distinct and fairly consistent
  chromosomal aberrations.
