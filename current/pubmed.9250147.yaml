abstract: Gene amplification is one of the molecular mechanisms resulting in the up-regulation
  of gene expression. In non-Hodgkins lymphomas, such gene amplifications have been
  identified rarely. Using comparative genomic hybridization, a technique that has
  proven to be very sensitive for the detection of high-level DNA amplifications,
  we analyzed 108 cases of B-cell neoplasms 42 chronic B-cell leukemias, 5 mantle
  cell lymphomas, and 61 aggressive B-cell lymphomas . Twenty-four high-level amplifications
  were identified in 13 of the patients and mapped to 15 different genomic regions.
  Regions most frequently amplified were bands Xq26-28, 2p23-24, and 2p14-16 as well
  as 18q21 three times each . Amplification of several proto-oncogenes and a cell
  cycle control gene N-MYC two cases , BCL2, CCND2, and GLI located within the amplified
  regions was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization
  to interphase nuclei of tumor cells. These data demonstrate that gene amplifications
  in B-cell neoplasms are much more frequent than previously assumed. The identification
  of highly amplified DNA regions and genes included in the amplicons provides important
  information for further analyses of genetic events involved in lymphomagenesis.
