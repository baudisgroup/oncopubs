abstract: Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor in adults and often
  results in unilateral blindness and or death. Previous cytogenetic characterizations
  of this tumor consistently revealed chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes
  3, 6, and 8 reports of other abnormalities vary in frequency. We defined cytogenetic
  abnormalities of this tumor using complementary in situ hybridization techniques
  on 10 uveal melanoma cell lines. Synthesis of comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and spectral karyotyping SKY results revealed that chromosomal rearrangement
  is involved in DNA sequence copy number abnormalities throughout the genome, but
  monosomy 3 was not found. Monosomy 3 is thought to be a significant prognostic indicator,
  so its absence was investigated further. Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  for chromosome 3 revealed approximately 1 centromere signal per cell, but probes
  for 3p and 3q revealed multiple telomere signals per cell, suggesting chromosomal
  rearrangement without whole-chromosome loss. Based on combined CGH, SKY, and FISH
  data, we propose that chromosome 3 is more frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements
  than whole-chromosome loss in uveal melanoma. Future approaches should be designed
  to confirm and enhance the resolution of regions of imbalance in primary tumors.
  Once identified, conserved chromosomal alterations that contribute to uveal melanoma
  may reveal the underlying aspects of uveal melanoma onset, metastasis and resistance
  to current treatment modalities.
