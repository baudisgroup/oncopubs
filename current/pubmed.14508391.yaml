abstract: Hepatoid adenocarcinoma HAC is a special type of extrahepatic adenocarcinoma,
  which has a striking morphologic similarity to hepatocellular carcinoma. Seven HACs
  arising in the stomach and one in the lung, all with liver metastasis, were studied.
  They shared clinical features, such as old age, high serum alpha-fetoprotein level,
  aggressive behavior, and hepatic tumor in absence of risk factors for hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC . Morphologically, tumors were characterized by an admixture of tubulo-and
  or papillary adenocarcinoma with hepatoid foci. In six cases, liver metastases showed
  an exclusive hepatoid differentiation, virtually indistinguishable from HCC with
  solid growth pattern. As HAC and HCC cannot be differentiated on the basis of morphology
  alone, differences in immunohistochemical reaction patterns would be of considerable
  diagnostic help. Immunostaining for CK7, CK8, CK18, CK19, CK20, alpha-fetoprotein,
  p-CEA, and HepPar1 revealed that hepatoid areas of both primary and metastatic HAC
  have a specific immunoprofile, distinctive of this entity. On the one hand, positivity
  of virtually all HACs for alpha-fetoprotein, CK8, CK18, and the membranous, canalicular
  staining for polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen underline its hepatoid nature.
  On the other hand, positive staining for CK19 and CK20 and frequent negativity for
  HepPar1 in both primary tumors and their metastases were distinctive features of
  HAC. Furthermore, HAC differs from combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma, being
  negative for CK7. In addition, for comparison of immunohistochemical results, we
  stained with the same antibody panel a tissue microarray of 121 HCCs. Comparative
  genomic hybridization study of three HAC supports their hepatoid differentiation
  as aberrations found in HAC are common in HCC 4q-, 8p- , and hepatoblastoma Xq ,
  respectively.
