abstract: A total of 127 adult de novo acute myelocytic leukemia AML patients were
  analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH at diagnosis. Conventional cytogenetic
  analysis CCA showed a normal karyotype in 45 cases and an abnormal karyotype in
  56 cases in the remaining cases, CCA either failed to yield sufficient metaphase
  cells 19 26 or was not done 7 26 . Abnormal CGH profiles were identified in 39 patients
  30.7 . DNA copy number losses 61 were high compared to gains 39 , whereas partial
  chromosome changes 76 were more common than whole chromosomes changes 24 . Recurrent
  losses were detected on chromosomes 7, 5q comprising bands 5q15 to 5q33 , 7q 7q32
  approximately q36 , 16q 16q13 approximately q21 , and 17p, and gains were detected
  on chromosomes 8, 22, and 3q comprising bands 3q26.1 approximately q27 . Furthermore,
  distinct amplifications were identified in chromosome regions 21q, 13q12 approximately
  q13, and 13q21.1. No cryptic recurrent chromosomal imbalances were identified by
  CGH in cases with normal karyotypes. The concordance between CGH results and CCA
  was 72.5 . In the remaining cases, CGH gave additional information compared to CCA
  20 and partially failed to identify the alterations previously detected by CCA 7.5
  . The majority of discrepancies arose from the limitations of the CGH technique,
  such as insensitivity to detect unbalanced chromosomal changes when occurring in
  a low proportion of cells. CGH increased the detection of unbalanced chromosomal
  alterations and allowed precise defining of partial or uncharacterized cytogenetical
  abnormalities. Application of the CGH technique is thus a useful complementary diagnostic
  tool for CCA in de novo AML cases with abnormal karyotypes or with unsuccessful
  cytogenetics.
