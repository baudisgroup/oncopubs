abstract: 'PURPOSE: Class 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K plays a major role
  in cell proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. Here, we
  investigated biomarker strategies for PI3K pathway inhibitors in non-small-cell
  lung cancer NSCLC . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Molecular profiling for candidate PI3K
  predictive biomarkers was conducted on a collection of NSCLC tumor samples. Assays
  included comparative genomic hybridization, reverse-transcription polymerase chain
  reaction gene expression, mutation detection for PIK3CA and other oncogenes, PTEN
  immunohistochemistry, and FISH for PIK3CA copy number. In addition, a panel of NSCLC
  cell lines characterized for alterations in the PI3K pathway was screened with PI3K
  and dual PI3K mTOR inhibitors to assess the preclinical predictive value of candidate
  biomarkers. RESULTS: PIK3CA amplification was detected in 37 of squamous tumors
  and 5 of adenocarcinomas, whereas PIK3CA mutations were found in 9 of squamous and
  0 of adenocarcinomas. Total loss of PTEN immunostaining was found in 21 of squamous
  tumors and 4 of adenocarcinomas. Cell lines harboring pathway alterations receptor
  tyrosine kinase activation, PI3K mutation or amplification, and PTEN loss were exquisitely
  sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. A dual PI3K mTOR inhibitor had broader
  activity across the cell line panel and in tumor xenografts. The combination of
  GDC-0941 with paclitaxel, erlotinib, or a mitogen-activated protein-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase inhibitor had greater effects on cell viability than PI3K
  inhibition alone. CONCLUSIONS: Candidate biomarkers for PI3K inhibitors have predictive
  value in preclinical models and show histology-specific alterations in primary tumors,
  suggesting that distinct biomarker strategies may be required in squamous compared
  with nonsquamous NSCLC patient populations.'
