abstract: Similar to other malignancies, urothelial carcinoma (UC) is characterized
  by specific recurrent chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations. However, the interconnection
  between specific genomic alterations, and how patterns of chromosomal alterations
  adhere to different molecular subgroups of UC, is less clear. We applied tiling
  resolution array CGH to 146 cases of UC and identified a number of regions harboring
  recurrent focal genomic amplifications and deletions. Several potential oncogenes
  were included in the amplified regions, including known oncogenes like E2F3, CCND1,
  and CCNE1, as well as new candidate genes, such as SETDB1 (1q21), and BCL2L1 (20q11).
  We next combined genome profiling with global gene expression, gene mutation, and
  protein expression data and identified two major genomic circuits operating in urothelial
  carcinoma. The first circuit was characterized by FGFR3 alterations, overexpression
  of CCND1, and 9q and CDKN2A deletions. The second circuit was defined by E3F3 amplifications
  and RB1 deletions, as well as gains of 5p, deletions at PTEN and 2q36, 16q, 20q,
  and elevated CDKN2A levels. TP53/MDM2 alterations were common for advanced tumors
  within the two circuits. Our data also suggest a possible RAS/RAF circuit. The tumors
  with worst prognosis showed a gene expression profile that indicated a keratinized
  phenotype. Taken together, our integrative approach revealed at least two separate
  networks of genomic alterations linked to the molecular diversity seen in UC, and
  that these circuits may reflect distinct pathways of tumor development.
