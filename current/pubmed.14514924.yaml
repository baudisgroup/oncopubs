abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in the world, ranking
  fifth in the Netherlands as a cause of cancer death. Surgery is the only curative
  treatment for advanced cases, but results of gastrectomy largely depend on the stage
  of the disease. A better understanding of the mechanisms of progression from a preneoplastic
  condition through intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive cancer may provide information
  relevant to designing focused prevention strategies.
