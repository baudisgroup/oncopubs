abstract: A number of distinct subtypes of neuroblastoma exist with different genetic
  abnormalities that are predicative of outcome. Whole chromosome gains are usually
  associated with low stage disease and favourable outcome, whereas loss of 1p, 3p
  and 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and MYCN amplification MNA are indicative of high
  stage disease and unfavourable prognosis. Although MNA and loss of 11q appear to
  represent two distinct genetic subtypes of advanced stage neuroblastoma, a detailed
  understanding of how these subtypes differ in terms of global gene expression is
  still lacking. We have used metaphase comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis
  in combination with oligonucleotide technology to identify patterns of gene expression
  that correlate with specific genomic imbalances found in primary neuroblastic tumours
  and cell lines. The tumours analysed in this manner included a ganglioneuroma, along
  with various ganglioneuroblastoma and neuroblastoma of different stages and histopathological
  classifications. Oligonucleotide microarray-based gene expression profile analysis
  was performed with Affymetrix HU133A arrays representing approximately 14 500 unique
  genes. The oligonucleotide microarray results were subsequently validated by quantitative
  real-time PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and by comparison of specific gene
  expression patterns with published results. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression
  data distinguished tumours on the basis of stage, differentiation and genetic abnormalities.
  A number of genes were identified whose patterns of expression were highly correlated
  with 11q loss supporting the concept that loss of 11q represents a distinct genetic
  subtype of neuroblastoma. The implications of these results in the process of neuroblastoma
  development and progression are discussed.
