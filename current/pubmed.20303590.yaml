abstract: 'The development of risk-adapted therapy has improved the treatment results
  of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL especially in children. However, more accurate
  risk classifiers are warranted. In this study we aimed at defining a prognostic
  classifier based on DNA copy number alterations of adolescent and young adult AYA
  10-25 yrs ALL patients n 60 determined by microarray CGH and the relapse status
  of the patients. As a result of prognostic model identification procedure, we got
  a model of four genes: BAK1, CDKN2C, GSTM1, and MT1F, the copy number profile combinations
  of which differentiated AYA ALL patients at diagnosis depending on their risk of
  relapse. The performance of the model was poorer on other age groups. We suggest
  that this kind of approach produces models simple and accurate enough for potential
  use in ALL routine classification.'
