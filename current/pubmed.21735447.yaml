abstract: The 11q13-q14 locus is frequently amplified in human cancers, with a complex
  structure harbouring multiple potential oncogenic drivers. The EMSY gene has been
  proposed as a driver of the third core of the 11q13-q14 amplicon. This gene encodes
  a protein reported to be a BRCA2-binding partner, which when over-expressed would
  lead to impairment of BRCA2 functions and could constitute a mechanism for BRCA2
  inactivation in non-hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. We hypothesized that
  if EMSY amplification abrogates BRCA2 functions, cells harbouring this aberration
  would be unable to elicit competent homologous recombination DNA repair and, therefore,
  may have increased sensitivity to genotoxic therapies and potent PARP inhibitors.
  Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization of cell lines from distinct tumour
  sites, including breast, ovary, pancreas, oesophagus, lung and the oral cavity,
  led to the identification of 10 cell lines with EMSY amplification and 18 without.
  EMSY amplification was shown to correlate with EMSY mRNA levels, although not all
  cell lines harbouring EMSY amplification displayed EMSY mRNA or protein over-expression.
  RNA interference-mediated silencing of EMSY did not lead to a reduction in cell
  viability in tumour models harbouring EMSY amplification. Cell lines with and without
  EMSY amplification displayed a similar ability to elicit RAD51 foci in response
  to DNA damaging agents, and similar sensitivity to cisplatin and olaparib. Taken
  together, this suggests that EMSY is unlikely to be a driver of the 11q13-q14 amplicon
  and does not have a dominant role in modulating the response to agents targeting
  cells with defective homologous recombination.
