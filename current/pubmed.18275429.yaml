abstract: Anaplastic large cell lymphoma ALCL is a T null-cell neoplasm characterized
  by chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK gene
  ALK . Tumours with similar morphology and phenotype but negative for ALK have been
  also recognized. The secondary chromosomal imbalances of these lymphomas are not
  well known. We have examined 74 ALCL, 43 ALK-positive and 31 ALK-negative, cases
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and locus-specific alterations for TP53
  and ATM were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction. Chromosomal imbalances were detected in 25 58 ALK-positive
  and 20 65 ALK-negative ALCL. ALK-positive ALCL with NPM-ALK or other ALK variant
  translocations showed a similar profile of secondary genetic alterations. Gains
  of 17p and 17q24-qter and losses of 4q13-q21, and 11q14 were associated with ALK-positive
  cases P 0.05 , whereas gains of 1q and 6p21 were more frequent in ALK-negative tumours
  P 0.03 . Gains of chromosome 7 and 6q and 13q losses were seen in both types of
  tumours. ALCL-negative tumours had a significantly worse prognosis than ALK-positive.
  However no specific chromosomal alterations were associated with survival. In conclusion,
  ALK-positive and negative ALCL have different secondary genomic aberrations, suggesting
  they correspond to different genetic entities.
