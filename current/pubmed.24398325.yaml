abstract: The genetic hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the t(8;14)(q24;q32) and
  its variants leading to activation of the MYC oncogene. It is a matter of debate
  whether true BL without MYC translocation exists. Here, we identified 59 lymphomas
  concordantly called BL by 2 gene expression classifiers among 753 B-cell lymphomas.
  Only 2 (3%) of these 59 molecular BL lacked a MYC translocation, which both shared
  a peculiar pattern of chromosome 11q aberration characterized by interstitial gains
  including 11q23.2-q23.3 and telomeric losses of 11q24.1-qter. We extended our analysis
  to 17 MYC-negative high-grade B-cell lymphomas with a similar 11q aberration and
  showed this aberration to be recurrently associated with morphologic and clinical
  features of BL. The minimal region of gain was defined by high-level amplifications
  in 11q23.3 and associated with overexpression of genes including PAFAH1B2 on a transcriptional
  and protein level. The recurrent region of loss contained a focal homozygous deletion
  in 11q24.2-q24.3 including the ETS1 gene, which was shown to be mutated in 4 of
  16 investigated cases. These findings indicate the existence of a molecularly distinct
  subset of B-cell lymphomas reminiscent of BL, which is characterized by deregulation
  of genes in 11q.
