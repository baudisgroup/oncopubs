abstract: Genomic copy number alterations CNA are common in breast cancer. Identifying
  characteristic CNAs associated with specific breast cancer subtypes is a critical
  step in defining potential mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. We
  used genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization to identify distinctive
  CNAs in breast cancer subtypes from 259 young diagnosed with breast cancer at amp
  lt 55 years African American AA and Caucasian American CA women originally enrolled
  in a larger population-based study. We compared the average frequency of CNAs across
  the whole genome for each breast tumor subtype and found that estrogen receptor
  ER -negative tumors had a higher average frequency of genome-wide gain P amp lt
  0.0001 and loss P 0.02 compared to ER-positive tumors. Triple-negative TN tumors
  had a higher average frequency of genome-wide gain P amp lt 0.0001 and loss P 0.003
  than non-TN tumors. No significant difference in CNA frequency was observed between
  HER2-positive and -negative tumors. We also identified previously unreported recurrent
  CNAs frequency amp gt 40 for TN breast tumors at 10q, 11p, 11q, 16q, 20p, and 20q.
  In addition, we report CNAs that differ in frequency between TN breast tumors of
  AA and CA women. This is of particular relevance because TN breast cancer is associated
  with higher mortality and young AA women have higher rates of TN breast tumors compared
  to CA women. These data support the possibility that higher overall frequency of
  genomic alteration events as well as specific focal CNAs in TN breast tumors might
  contribute in part to the poor breast cancer prognosis for young AA women.
