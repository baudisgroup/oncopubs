abstract: 'PURPOSE: East-Asian EA patients with non-small-cell lung cancer NSCLC are
  associated with a high proportion of nonsmoking women, epidermal growth factor receptor
  EGFR -activating somatic mutations, and clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
  We sought to identify novel molecular differences between NSCLCs from EA and Western
  European WE patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 226 lung adenocarcinoma samples
  from EA n 90 and WE n 136 patients were analyzed for copy number aberrations CNA
  by using a common high-resolution SNP single nucleotide polymorphism microarray
  platform. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify CNAs
  specifically related to smoking history, EGFR mutation status, and ethnicity. RESULTS:
  The overall genomic profiles of adenocarcinomas from EA and WE patients were highly
  similar. Univariate analyses revealed several CNAs significantly associated with
  ethnicity, EGFR mutation, and smoking, but not to gender, and KRAS or p53 mutations.
  A multivariate model identified four ethnic-specific recurrent CNAs-significantly
  higher rates of copy number gain were observed on 16p13.13 and 16p13.11 in EA tumors,
  whereas higher rates of genomic loss on 19p13.3 and 19p13.11 were observed in tumors
  from WE patients. We identified several potential driver genes in these regions,
  showing a positive correlation between cis-localized copy number changes and transcriptomic
  changes. CONCLUSION: 16p copy number gains EA and 19p losses WE are ethnic-specific
  chromosomal aberrations in lung adenocarcinoma. Patient ethnicity should be considered
  when evaluating future NSCLC therapies targeting genes located on these areas.'
