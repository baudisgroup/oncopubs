abstract: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma confined to the CNS. Whether there is a PCNSL-specific genomic signature
  and, if so, how it differs from systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is
  uncertain.  We performed a comprehensive genomic study of tumor samples from 19
  immunocompetent PCNSL patients. Testing comprised array-comparative genomic hybridization
  and whole exome sequencing.  Biallelic inactivation of TOX and PRKCD were recurrently
  found in PCNSL but not in systemic DLBCL, suggesting a specific role in PCNSL pathogenesis.
  Additionally, we found a high prevalence of MYD88 mutations (79%) and CDKN2A biallelic
  loss (60%). Several genes recurrently affected in PCNSL were common with systemic
  DLBCL, including loss of TNFAIP3, PRDM1, GNA13, TMEM30A, TBL1XR1, B2M, CD58, activating
  mutations of CD79B, CARD11 and translocations IgH-BCL6. Overall, BCR/TLR/NF-ÎºB
  pathways were altered in >90% of PNCSL, highlighting its value for targeted therapeutic
  approaches. Furthermore, integrated analysis showed enrichment of pathways associated
  with immune response, proliferation, apoptosis, and lymphocyte differentiation.  In
  summary, genome-wide analysis uncovered novel recurrent alterations, including TOX
  and PRKCD, helping to differentiate PCNSL from systemic DLBCL and related lymphomas.  Copyright
