abstract: We aimed to characterize the genomic profiles of adenocarcinomas in the
  gastroesophageal junction in relation to cancers in the esophagus and the stomach.
  Profiles of gains losses as well as gene expression profiles were obtained from
  27 gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas by means of 32k high-resolution array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization and 27k oligo gene expression arrays, and putative
  target genes were validated in an extended series. Adenocarcinomas in the distal
  esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction showed strong similarities with the
  most common gains at 20q13, 8q24, 1q21-23, 5p15, 13q34, and 12q13, whereas different
  profiles with gains at 5p15, 7p22, 2q35, and 13q34 characterized gastric cancers.
  CDK6 and EGFR were identified as putative target genes in cancers of the esophagus
  and the gastroesophageal junction, with upregulation in one quarter of the tumors.
  Gains losses and gene expression profiles show strong similarity between cancers
  in the distal esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction with frequent upregulation
  of CDK6 and EGFR, whereas gastric cancer displays distinct genetic changes. These
  data suggest that molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies can be applied to
  adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction alike.
