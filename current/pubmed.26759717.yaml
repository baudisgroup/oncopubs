abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the sixth most lethal cancer
  worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. Genomic characterization of
  tumors, particularly those of different stages, is likely to reveal additional oncogenic
  mechanisms. Although copy number alterations and somatic point mutations associated
  with the development of ESCC have been identified by array-based technologies and
  genome-wide studies, the genomic characterization of ESCCs from different stages
  of the disease has not been explored. Here, we have performed either whole-genome
  sequencing or whole-exome sequencing on 51 stage I and 53 stage III ESCC patients
  to characterize the genomic alterations that occur during the various clinical stages
  of ESCC, and further validated these changes in 36 atypical hyperplasia samples.  Recurrent
  somatic amplifications at 8q were found to be enriched in stage I tumors and the
  deletions of 4p-q and 5q were particularly identified in stage III tumors. In particular,
  the FAM84B gene was amplified and overexpressed in preclinical and ESCC tumors.
  Knockdown of FAM84B in ESCC cell lines significantly reduced in vitro cell growth,
  migration and invasion. Although the cancer-associated genes TP53, PIK3CA, CDKN2A
  and their pathways showed no significant difference between stage I and stage III
  tumors, we identified and validated a prevalence of mutations in NOTCH1 and in the
  NOTCH pathway that indicate that they are involved in the preclinical and early
  stages of ESCC.  Our results suggest that FAM84B and the NOTCH pathway are involved
  in the progression of ESCC and may be potential diagnostic targets for ESCC susceptibility.
