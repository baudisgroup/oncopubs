abstract: One of the most common characteristic profiles of cancer is intratumoral
  heterogeneity ITH . We aimed to clarify the molecular profiles and biological significance
  of ITH with relation to cancer stem cell CSC . We analyzed five primary cultured
  clones generated from different spatial zones, front and rear zone, of a fresh-frozen
  ovarian tumor tissue, performing ATP-CRA, conventional RT-PCR, side population SP
  analysis, flow cytometry immunophenotyping, and cell proliferation assays. We also
  carried out array CGH and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis IPA between SP and non-SP
  NSP cells. Clones from tumor front zone showed phenotypically and genetically distinct
  subpopulations with relatively higher SP proportions, CD24 and CD117 expression,
  and chemotherapeutic resistance. We demonstrate that phenotype of SP cells in heterogeneous
  clones of human ovarian cancer was closely related to CD24 , CD117 , and combined
  CD117 CD24 fractions. Chromosomal alterations in SP cells relative to NSP cells
  were closely related to the novel core networks of cancer stem cell-like cells CSCs
  , such as cycle checkpoint regulation, notch, PTEN, wnt -catenin, PI3K AKT, integrin,
  and cytokine and chemokine signaling. ITH could arise from clonal diversity closely
  related to CSC-like molecules, as evidenced by accumulated genetic, transcriptional
  and gene products alterations in SP.
