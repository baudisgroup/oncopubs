abstract: Although several genes have been investigated in adrenal tumorigenesis,
  the genetic background of adrenocortical tumors ACT remains poorly characterized.
  In southern Brazil, the annual incidence of ACT is unusually high, ranging from
  3.4-4.2 million children, compared with a worldwide incidence of 0.3 million children
  younger than 15 yr. Environmental factors have been implicated because the distribution
  of these tumors follows a regional, rather than a familial, pattern. However, decreased
  penetrance of a particular gene defect cannot be excluded. Because linkage or other
  traditional genetic analyses would not be appropriate to investigate the defect
  s associated with ACT in this population, we used comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH to screen for DNA sequence copy number changes in 9 nonfamilial ACT 6 carcinomas
  and 3 adenomas from unrelated patients from this region. Six female aged 10 months
  to 6 3 4 yr and 3 male 1 1 12 to 3 1 4 yr patients were studied. Three carcinomas
  were at stage I, 1 was at stage II, and another was at stage III. Two carcinomas
  had evidence of invasion of the vena cava, and 3 were more than 3 cm in size. All
  patients underwent surgical excision of their tumors chemotherapy was administered
  to cancer patients. Currently, all patients are alive and in remission, with the
  exception of 1 patient with stage III cancer. High mol wt DNA was extracted from
  tumor tissue obtained at surgery and frozen at -70 C. This DNA was labeled and used
  for CGH according to standard procedures. Digital image analysis was performed to
  detect chromosomal gains or losses. CGH evaluation revealed extensive genetic aberrations
  in both adenomas and carcinomas there were no significant differences relative to
  age, gender, size, or stage of the tumor P amp gt 0.1 . Chromosomes and chromosomal
  regions 1q, 5p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p, 8q, 9q, 10p, 11q, 12q, 13q, 14q, 15q, 16, 18q, 19,
  and 20q demonstrated gains, whereas 2q, 3, 4, 9p, 11, 13q, 18, 20p, and Xq showed
  losses. The most striking finding was consistent copy number gain of chromosomal
  region 9q34 in 8 of the 9 tumors. We conclude that both benign and malignant ACT
  from southern Brazil show multiple genetic aberrations, including a consistent gain
  of chromosomal region 9q34. This genomic area may harbor genetic defects that predispose
  to ACT formation and are shared by the patients who were investigated in this study
  or are accumulated epigenetically under the influence of a common factor, such as
  an environmental mutagen.
