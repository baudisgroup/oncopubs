abstract: 'The diagnosis and management of uterine smooth muscle tumors with uncertain
  malignant potential (STUMP) is often challenging, and genomic data on these lesions
  as well as on uterine smooth muscle lesions are limited. We tested the hypothesis
  that genomic profile determination by array-CGH could split STUMP into a benign
  group with scarce chromosomal alterations akin to leiomyoma and a malignant group
  with high chromosomal instability akin to leiomyosarcoma. Array-CGH genomic profile
  analysis was conducted for a series of 29 cases of uterine STUMP. A group of ten
  uterine leiomyomas and ten uterine leiomyosarcomas served as controls. The mean
  age was 50 years (range, 24-85) and the follow-up ranged from 12 to 156 months (average
  70 months). Since STUMP is a heterogenous group of tumors with genomic profiles
  that can harbor few to many chromosomal alterations, we compared genomic indices
  in leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas and set a genomic index=10 threshold. Tumors with
  a genomic index <10 were classified as nonrecurring STUMPs and those with a genomic
  index >10 represented STUMPs with recurrences and unfavorable outcomes. Hence, the
  genomic index threshold splits the STUMP category into two groups of tumors with
  different outcomes: a group comparable to leiomyomas and another similar to leiomyosarcomas,
  but more indolent. In our STUMP series, genomic analysis by array-CGH is an innovative
  diagnostic tool for problematic smooth muscle uterine lesions, complementary to
  the morphological evaluation approach. We provide an improved classification method
  for distinguishing truly malignant tumors from benign lesions within the category
  of STUMP, especially those with equivocal morphological features.Modern Pathology
