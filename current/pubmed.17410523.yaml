abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL with increased prolymphocytes CLL PL has
  been defined by the World Health Organization WHO classification and considered
  as a progressive and clinically aggressive variant of CLL. To further characterize
  the biological features of this disease, we performed IgVH gene mutational status,
  FISH and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization HR-CGH analysis in 17
  cases of CLL PL. All CLL PL utilized members of VH1, VH3 and VH4 families, with
  the highest prevalence of the VH1-69 gene. In all but one cases analyzed, the VH
  genes were unmutated. The FISH and HR-CGH analyses showed frequent occurrence of
  trisomy 12, del 11 q23 , del 17 p13 and genetic imbalances, but recurrent genetic
  lesion characteristic for CLL PL was not found. The follow-up HR-CGH analysis of
  two cases showed that increase of prolymphocytes in the course of CLL or CLL PL
  are associated with clonal evolution and selection of the tumour clone. In conclusion,
  this study suggests that CLL PL is a relatively homogeneous disease regarding VH
  gene mutation, but heterogeneous regarding genetic lesions. The heterogeneity and
  high number of genomic imbalances found in CLL PL suggest that a genome-wide instability
  of the neoplastic cells may play a role in the development of the disease.
