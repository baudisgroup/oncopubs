abstract: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell (ENK/T) lymphoma is a rare neoplasm, subcategorized
  into ENK/T-nasal (ENK/T-N) and ENK/T-nasal type (ENK/T-NT) lymphomas. ENK/T-NT lymphoma
  with initial presentation in the skin is known as primary cutaneous ENK/T-NT (PC-ENK/T-NT)
  lymphoma. The aim of this study was to investigate pathogenesis, genomic alterations,
  and prognosis of cutaneous ENK/T lymphomas to provide further insights into clinicopathologic
  features and genetic mechanism of lymphomagenesis. A retrospective case study of
  5 white patients affected by ENK/T lymphoma (4 PC-ENK/T-NT and 1 ENK/T-N with cutaneous
  involvement) was performed. Most of the cases presented with multiple nodules and
  ulcerations localized on the extremities. A considerable percentage had disease
  in advanced stage with a 12-month survival rate of 40%. Genomic alterations were
  detected by array-based comparative genomic hybridization that showed gains of 1q,
  7q and loss of 17p in the cases of PC-ENK/T-NT lymphomas and gain of 7q and loss
  of 9p, 12p, 12q in the case of ENK/T-N lymphoma. In conclusion, ENK/T lymphoma is
  a very aggressive entity, and, in our cases, the exclusively cutaneous presentation
  was not associated with a better prognosis. The results of our array comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis could be useful to better define the different ENK/T
  lymphoma subgroups with cutaneous involvement.
