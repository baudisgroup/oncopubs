abstract: Relapse is the most common cause of treatment failure in pediatric acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia ALL and is often difficult to predict. To explore the prognostic
  impact of recurrent DNA copy number abnormalities on relapse, we performed high-resolution
  genomic profiling of 34 paired diagnosis and relapse ALL samples. Recurrent lesions
  detected at diagnosis, including PAX5, CDKN2A and EBF1, were frequently absent at
  relapse, indicating that they represent secondary events that may be absent in the
  relapse-prone therapy-resistant progenitor cell. In contrast, deletions and nonsense
  mutations in IKZF1 IKAROS were highly enriched and consistently preserved at the
  time of relapse. A targeted copy number screen in an unselected cohort of 131 precursor
  B-ALL cases, enrolled in the dexamethasone-based Dutch Childhood Oncology Group
  treatment protocol ALL9, revealed that IKZF1 deletions are significantly associated
  with poor relapse-free and overall survival rates. Separate analysis of ALL9-treatment
  subgroups revealed that non-high-risk NHR patients with IKZF1 deletions exhibited
  a approximately 12-fold higher relative relapse rate than those without IKZF1 deletions.
  Consequently, IKZF1 deletion status allowed the prospective identification of 53
  of the relapse-prone NHR-classified patients within this subgroup and, therefore,
  serves as one of the strongest predictors of relapse at the time of diagnosis with
  high potential for future risk stratification.
