abstract: In a genome-wide screen of 684 cancer cell lines, we identified homozygous
  intragenic microdeletions involving genes encoding components of the apical-basal
  cell polarity complexes. Among these, PARD3 is disrupted in cell lines and primary
  tumors from squamous carcinomas and glioblastomas. Reconstituting PARD3 expression
  in both cell types restores tight junctions and retards contact-dependent proliferation.
  Searching specifically for small intragenic microdeletions using high-resolution
  genomic arrays may be complementary to other genomic deletion screens and resequencing
  efforts in identifying new tumor suppressor genes.
