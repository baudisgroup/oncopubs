abstract: Screening the whole glioblastoma multiforme GBM genome for aberrations is
  a good starting point when looking for molecular markers that could potentially
  stratify patients according to prognosis and optimal treatment. We investigated
  80 primary untreated GBM using both G-banding analysis and high-resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization HR-CGH . Abnormal karyotypes were found in 83 of the tumors.
  The most common numerical chromosome aberrations were 7, -10, -13, -14, -15, 20,
  and -22. Structural abnormalities most commonly involved chromosomes 1 and 3, and
  the short arm of chromosome 9. HR-CGH verified these findings and revealed additional
  frequent losses at 1p34-36, 6q22-27, and 19q12-13 and gains of 3q26 and 12q13-15.
  Although most karyotypes and gain loss patterns were complex, there was also a distinct
  subset of tumors displaying simple karyotypic changes only. There was a statistically
  significant association between trisomy 7 and monosomy 10, and also between 7 -10
  as putative primary aberrations and secondary losses of 1p, 9p, 13q, and 22q. The
  low number of tumors in the rarer histological tumor subgroups precludes definite
  conclusions, but there did not seem to be any clear-cut cytogenetic-pathological
  correlations, perhaps with the exception of ring chromosomes in giant cell glioblastomas.
  Our findings demonstrate that although GBM is a pathogenetically very heterogeneous
  group of diseases, distinct genomic aberration patterns exist.
