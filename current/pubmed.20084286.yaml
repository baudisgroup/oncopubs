abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We have previously identified genome-wide DNA methylation changes
  in a cell line model of breast cancer metastasis. These complex epigenetic changes
  that we observed, along with concurrent karyotype analyses, have led us to hypothesize
  that complex genomic alterations in cancer cells deletions, translocations and ploidy
  are superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible
  for gene-specific expression changes observed in breast cancer metastasis. METHODOLOGY
  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook simultaneous high-resolution, whole-genome analyses
  of MDA-MB-468GFP and MDA-MB-468GFP-LN human breast cancer cell lines an isogenic,
  paired lymphatic metastasis cell line model using Affymetrix gene expression U133
  , promoter 1.0R , and SNP CNV SNP 6.0 microarray platforms to correlate data from
  gene expression, epigenetic DNA methylation , and combination copy number variant
  single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. Using Partek Software and Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis we integrated datasets from these three platforms and detected
  multiple hypomethylation and hypermethylation events. Many of these epigenetic alterations
  correlated with gene expression changes. In addition, gene dosage events correlated
  with the karyotypic differences observed between the cell lines and were reflected
  in specific promoter methylation patterns. Gene subsets were identified that correlated
  hyper and hypo methylation with the loss or gain of gene expression and in parallel,
  with gene dosage losses and gains, respectively. Individual gene targets from these
  subsets were also validated for their methylation, expression and copy number status,
  and susceptible gene pathways were identified that may indicate how selective advantage
  drives the processes of tumourigenesis and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS SIGNIFICANCE:
  Our approach allows more precisely profiling of functionally relevant epigenetic
  signatures that are associated with cancer progression and metastasis.'
