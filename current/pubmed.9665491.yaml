abstract: 'Biopsies routinely performed for the histopathological diagnosis of oral
  epithelial lesions before treatment were screened for chromosomal imbalances by
  comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed
  on 12 oral premalignant lesions OPLs dysplasias and carcinomas in situ and 14 oral
  squamous cell carcinomas OSCCs . Eight biopsies displayed areas of different histopathological
  appearance, so that OPLs and OSCCs from the same patient were analyzed. To avoid
  contamination with nonneoplastic cells, defined cell populations were isolated by
  micromanipulation with a glass needle. Before comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis, universal DNA amplification was performed using the DOP-polymerase chain
  reaction protocol. In the 14 OSCCs examined, the average number of chromosomal imbalances
  was significantly higher than in the 12 OPLs mean - SEM: 11.9 - 1.9 versus 3.2 -
  1.2 P 0.003 . The DNA copy number changes identified in more than one OPL were gains
  on 8q 3 of 12 and 16p 2 of 12 , as well as losses on 3p 5 of 12 5q 4 of 12 13q 3
  of 12 and 4q, 8p, and 9p 2 of 12 each . In more than 30 of OSCCs, gains of chromosomal
  material were identified on 20q 8 of 14 8q, 11q, 22q 7 of 14 each 3q, 15q, and 17p
  6 of 14 each and 14q, 17q, and 20p 5 of 14 each , and losses were identified on
  3p and 4q 9 of 14 each , 5q 7 of 14 , 13q 6 of 14 , and 2q and 9p 5 of 14 each .
  These results were validated by positive and negative control comparative genomic
  hybridization experiments and microsatellite analysis for the detection of allelic
  loss. The vast majority of genomic alterations found in OPLs were again identified
  in OSCCs from the same biopsy, supporting the hypothesis that multiple lesions in
  the same patient are clonally related. In summary, we show that comprehensive information
  on the genomic alterations in oral epithelial lesions can be obtained from small
  biopsies. Such data may identify prognostic indicators that could eventually assist
  in designing therapeutic strategies.'
