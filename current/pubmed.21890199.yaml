abstract: The diagnosis of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm BPDCN can
  be challenging, owing to the absence of traditional lineage-specific markers, but
  is facilitated by CD4 CD56 co-expression and frequent skin involvement. Herein,
  we present our collective experiences with three BPDCN cases lacking cutaneous presentation
  and the inherent diagnostic pitfalls. Taken in context of similar historical cases,
  we suggest that BPDCN with amp quot leukemic amp quot presentation L-BPDCN otherwise
  presents no major distinguishing features and is at least as aggressive as its cutaneous-involved
  BPDCN counterpart.
