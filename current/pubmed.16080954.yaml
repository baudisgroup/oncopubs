abstract: Leiomyosarcomas LMS account for 10-20 of all soft tissue sarcomas. We analyzed
  10 primary, 5 metastatic, and 2 recurrent extrauterine LMS. Genomic imbalances were
  detected in 15 out of the 17 tumors. The most common regions of loss were 13q 59
  , 10 of 17 , 10q 59 , 10 of 17 , 2q 35 , 6 of 17 , and 16q 29 , 5 of 17 . The most
  common region of gain was 5p 35 , 6 of 17 . High-level gain of DNA copy number was
  detected in 6p and 17p. Loss of function of tumor suppressor genes or the activation
  of oncogenes or both of these factors resulting from these copy number changes might
  play an important role in the development of extrauterine LMS. Large tumors and
  tumors with metastasis showed 10q deletions. Gain of 5p was detected only in G3
  tumors. These findings are consistent with our earlier study on uterine LMS and
  indicate that loss of 10q and gain of 5p are associated with an aggressive behavior
  of LMS. A larger series of cases is needed to confirm these results.
