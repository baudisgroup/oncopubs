abstract: Activating kinase fusions have recently been described as early oncogenic
  events that are mutually exclusive with HRAS and BRAF mutations in Spitz tumors.
  Here, we report a series of 32 Spitz tumors with ALK fusions (6 Spitz nevi, 22 atypical
  Spitz tumors, and 4 spitzoid melanomas) in patients ranging from 5 months to 64
  years (median=12 y) of age. The tumors typically presented as exophytic papules
  on the extremities and were occasionally darkly pigmented. In addition to ALK fusions
  previously described in other tumor types (NPM1-ALK, TPR-ALK), we identified 2 novel
  ALK fusions (CLIP1-ALK and GTF3C2-ALK) in our cohort of Spitz tumors. Array comparative
  genomic hybridization of 19 of these tumors demonstrated a high frequency of chromosome
  2 aberrations (where ALK resides, 63%) and chromosome 1p loss in 37% of the cases.
  Spitz tumors with ALK fusions demonstrated unique histopathologic features. Clefts
  and small vesicle-like spaces were arrayed between plump spindled melanocytes with
  fibrillar cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei. These melanocytes were typically arrayed
  in elongated and fusiform nests with radial orientation. The tumors often had extension
  into the dermis or subcutis with a wedge-shaped or bulbous lower border (45% and
  17%, respectively). An infiltrative growth pattern was often present at the periphery
  of the tumor and was highlighted by ALK immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, Spitz
  tumors with ALK rearrangement show distinct histopathologic features that should
  aid in improving classification of these diagnostically challenging tumors.
