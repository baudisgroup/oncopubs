abstract: TEL AML1 gene fusion that results from a cryptic t 12 21 is the most common
  genetic aberration in childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . While
  the translocation may initiate the leukemic process, critical secondary genetic
  events are currently believed to be pivotal for leukemogenesis. We investigated
  12 cases of childhood ALL with TEL AML1 gene fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH and comparative genomic hybridization CGH and documented additional or secondary
  genetic changes in seven patients 58 . Three patients showed extra copies of chromosome
  21 including a case in which the trisomy 21 21 clone was distinct from the one harboring
  TEL AML1 gene fusion. Interestingly, one patient without 21 showed amplification
  of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21q, supporting the contention that AML1 amplification
  may be an important additional genetic event. Gene expression study by semi-quantitative
  reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in two of these four patients
  showed an increase in AML1 transcripts that paralleled the increase in gene copy
  number. Deletion of the normal TEL allele was detected in two patients, with one
  of them showing loss of chromosome 12 together with duplication of the der 12 t
  12 21 . Finally, one patient showed duplication of the fusion signal. Our findings
  confirm that additional or secondary genetic changes including AML1 amplification
  are commonly encountered in childhood ALL with TEL AML1 gene fusion, which are envisaged
  to play significant roles in disease progression.
