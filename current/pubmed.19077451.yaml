abstract: Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation CGH has allowed high-resolution
  analysis of DNA copy number alterations across the entire cancer genome. Recent
  advances in bioinformatics tools enable us to perform a robust and highly sensitive
  analysis of array CGH data and facilitate the discovery of novel cancer-related
  genes.
