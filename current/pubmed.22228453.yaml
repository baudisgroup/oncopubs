abstract: The presence of genetic changes is a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
  CLL . The most common cytogenetic abnormalities with independent prognostic significance
  in CLL are 13q14, ATM and TP53 deletions and trisomy 12. However, CLL displays a
  great genetic and biological heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to analyze
  the genomic imbalances in CLL cytogenetic subsets from both genomic and gene expression
  perspectives to identify new recurrent alterations.
