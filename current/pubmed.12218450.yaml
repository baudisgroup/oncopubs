abstract: Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr virus EBV both have been associated
  with gastric carcinoma. No specific genomic aberrations have been reported in association
  with these agents. We studied 20 cases of primary gastric carcinoma including 11
  positive for and 6 for EBV by comparative genomic hybridization with validation
  of results by fluorescence in situ hybridization, loss of heterozygosity analysis,
  and immunohistochemistry. The results were analyzed in respect to presence or absence
  of and EBV. The tumors were also compared in terms of histologic type, tumor location,
  and lymph node metastases. The most frequently observed aberrations in the gastric
  carcinomas were gains of chromosome 19, 17, 1p, 11, 20q, and 22. The more common
  losses were found in 4q, 6q, 13q, and 15q. Gains in chromosome 19 and losses in
  9p23-pter were found more commonly in cases with P amp lt 0.05 . Gains in centromeric
  region of chromosome 19 were more common in the EBV-negative cases P amp lt 0.05
  . Immunohistochemical expression of and correlated with gains in the regions containing
  these genes. Gains in chromosome 11 and losses in 15q15 were more common in cases
  with EBV P amp lt 0.01 and P amp lt 0.001, respectively . There was no significant
  association between any genomic aberration and histologic type, tumor location,
  or nodal metastases. and EBV are associated with different genomic imbalances, suggesting
  that these infectious agents exert different influences in the development of gastric
  carcinoma.
