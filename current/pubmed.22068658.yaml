abstract: Problems in management of oral cancers or precancers include identification
  of patients at risk for metastasis, tumor recurrence, and second primary tumors
  or risk for progression of precancers dysplasia to cancer. Thus, the objective of
  this study was to clarify the role of genomic aberrations in oral cancer progression
  and metastasis.
