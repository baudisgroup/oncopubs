abstract: In breast cancer, the basal-like subtype has high levels of genomic instability
  relative to other breast cancer subtypes with many basal-like-specific regions of
  aberration. There is evidence that this genomic instability extends to smaller scale
  genomic aberrations, as shown by a previously described micro-deletion event in
  the PTEN gene in the Basal-like SUM149 breast cancer cell line.
