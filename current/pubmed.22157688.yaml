abstract: "In the study of tumour genetics, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)
  tumours are the most readily available tissue samples and DNA derived from FFPE
  tissue has been validated for array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) and
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Furthermore, in the study of
  tumour precursor genetics, whole genome amplification (WGA) has been used to produce
  a sufficient amount of DNA for aCGH. However, it is unclear whether the same approach
  can be extended to high-resolution SNP analysis.  In this study, we examined the
  utility and limitations of genotyping platforms performed on WGA DNA from FFPE mesenchymal
  tumour samples for both copy number and SNP analyses. We analysed the results obtained
  using DNA derived from matched FFPE and frozen tissue samples on the Affymetrix
  250K Nsp SNP array. Two widely used WGA methods, Qiagen (isothermal protocol) and
  Sigma (thermocycling protocol) were employed to determine how WGA methods affect
  the results.  We found that the use of WGA DNA derived from FFPE mesenchymal tumours
  for high-resolution SNP array application can produce a significant amount of false
  positive and false negative findings. While some of these misinterpretations appear
  to cluster in genomic regions with high or low GC contents, the majority appears
  to occur randomly. Only large scale chromosome loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (>10â\x80\x8AMb)
  can be reliably detected from WGA FFPE tumour DNA samples but not smaller LOH or
  copy number alterations.  Our findings here indicate a need for caution in SNP array
  data interpretation when using WGA FFPE tumour-derived DNA in determining genomic
  alterations less than 10â\x80\x8AMb."
