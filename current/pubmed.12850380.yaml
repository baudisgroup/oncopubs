abstract: Little is known about the extent of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity in
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC . We therefore examined 79 stage III
  and IV primary HNSCCs P and matched lymph node metastases M for over- and underrepresentation
  of specific chromosome regions by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The overall
  ratio of gains and losses was higher in metastases than in primary tumors 4 1 vs.
  2.5 1 . Gains of 3q 78.1 P vs. 87.5 M and 11q 78.1 P vs. 62.5 M and deletions of
  3p 43.8 P vs. 34.4 M and 9p 31.3 P vs. 15.6 M were most frequently detected. The
  highest rate of intratumoral discordance was observed for primary tumors and corresponding
  metastases 32.8 compared with matched pairs of two metastases 26.5 and of two anatomically
  distinct sides of one primary tumor 24.3 . Furthermore, the discordance rate was
  dependent on the primary tumor site oral cavity 49.2 , oropharynx 31 , hypopharynx
  30.3 , and larynx 27.3 . In some tumors, the extent of genomic discordance argues
  against a monoclonal origin. In conclusion, we found a high individual variation
  of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity depending on the localization and selection
  of matched pairs. These findings are of specific importance in view of establishing
  prognostic markers.
