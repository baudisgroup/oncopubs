abstract: The aims of this study were to compare genetic aberrations in primary soft-tissue
  sarcomas and their local recurrences and to evaluate the genetic changes occurring
  during tumor progression. A primary soft-tissue sarcoma and its subsequent local
  recurrence were analyzed in 20 tumor pairs by comparative genomic hybridization.
  The samples were obtained before application of radio- or chemotherapy. Copy number
  aberrations were detected in 50 of the primary tumors and in 70 of the local recurrences.
  In primary tumors, the mean number of changes was 2.45 range, 0 to 11 whereas in
  local recurrences, it was 5.05 range, 0 to 17 . The mean increase of changes from
  primary tumor to local recurrence was 2.6 per tumor pair P .02 . Gains predominated
  over losses in both primary tumors and their local recurrences. The number of high-level
  amplifications was twofold in local recurrences. The most frequent gain affected
  5p14-p15.1 10 of primary tumors, 25 of local recurrences and the most frequent loss,
  9p 9p21-pter in 5 of primary tumors 9p22-pter in 30 of local recurrences . In conclusion,
  our results show an increase in the number of genetic changes in local recurrences,
  due to tumor progression. Loss at 9p and gains at 5p and 20q were more frequent
  in local recurrences, and high-level amplification of 18p11.3 was not detected in
  any of the primary tumors. Although all these alterations were not specific to local
  recurrences, they may represent changes important during tumor progression.
