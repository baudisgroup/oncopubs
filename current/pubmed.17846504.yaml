abstract: Most neuroblastoma cells have chromosomal aberrations such as gains, losses,
  amplifications and deletions of DNA. Conventional approaches like fluorescence in
  situ hybridization FISH or metaphase comparative genomic hybridization CGH can detect
  chromosomal aberrations, but their resolution is low. In this study we used array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization to identify the chromosomal aberrations in human
  neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The DNA microarray consisting of 4000 bacterial artificial
  chromosome BAC clones was able to detect chromosomal regions with aberrations. The
  SH-SY5Y cells showed chromosomal gains in 1q12 approximately q44 Chr1:142188905-246084832
  , 7 over the whole chromosome , 2p25.3 approximately p16.3 Chr2:18179-47899074 ,
  and 17q 21.32 approximately q25.3 Chr17:42153031-78607159 , while chromosomal losses
  detected were the distal deletion of 1p36.33 Chr1:552910-563807 , 14q21.1 approximately
  q21.3 Chr14:37666271- 47282550 , and 22q13.1 approximately q13.2 Chr22:36885764-4190
  7123 . Except for the gain in 17q21 and the loss in 1p36, the other regions of gain
  or loss in SH-SY5Y cells were newly identified.
