abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recurrence prediction of hepatitis B virus HBV -related hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation LT present a great challenge
  because of a lack of biomarkers. Genetic variations play an important role in tumor
  development and metastasis. METHODS: Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to evaluate
  the genetic characteristics of tumor DNA in 30 HBV-related HCC patients who were
  underwent LT. Recurrence-related single-nucleotide polymorphism were selected, and
  their prognostic value was assessed and validated in two independent cohorts of
  HCC patients N 102 and N 77 , using pretransplant plasma circulating DNA. Prognostic
  significance was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests.
  Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate prognosis-related factors. RESULTS:
  rs894151 and rs12438080 were significantly associated with recurrence P .003 and
  P .004, respectively . Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the co-index of the
  2 SNPs was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence P .040 . Similar results
  were obtained in the third cohort N 77 . Furthermore, for HCC patients all the 3
  cohorts exceeding Milan criteria, the co-index was a prognostic factor for recurrence
  and survival P lt .001 and P .002, respectively . CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated
  first that genetic variations of rs894151 and rs12438080 in pretransplant plasma
  circulating DNA are promising prognostic markers for tumor recurrence in HCC patients
  undergoing LT and identify a subgroup of patients who, despite having HCC exceeding
  Milan criteria, have a low risk of post-transplant recurrence.'
