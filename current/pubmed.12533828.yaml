abstract: 'Three different cancers predominantly occur at the gastro-oesophageal junction:
  squamous cell carcinomas of the distal oesophagus, adenocarcinomas of the distal
  oesophagus Barretts carcinomas , and adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia. The
  aim of the present study was to investigate how, and to what extent, Barretts carcinoma
  differs from adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia on the one hand and squamous cell
  carcinoma of the distal oesophagus on the other, with respect to chromosomal aberrations
  and related gene expression. The present study analysed 14 squamous cell carcinomas,
  24 Barretts carcinomas, and 16 carcinomas of the gastric cardia. Comparative genomic
  hybridization revealed chromosomal abnormalities in all cases. Typical chromosomal
  aberrations for the squamous cell carcinoma type were gains at 3q and 11q13, and
  losses at 3p, 4q, 9p, 11q, and 13q. In contrast, typical copy number changes for
  both cardiac and Barretts adenocarcinomas were gains at 2q, 7p, and 13q, and losses
  at 17p. High-level amplification occurred in all three groups, but its frequency
  in the cardiac carcinomas was lower than in the other two groups. In conclusion,
  squamous cell carcinomas are characterized by chromosomal aberrations which are
  distinct from those seen in carcinomas of the gastric cardia and in Barretts adenocarcinomas.
  With respect to Barretts cancer, the chromosomal aberrations more closely reflect
  the adenocarcinoma phenotype than the squamous origin of the epithelium.'
