abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to evaluate tissue specimens
  from 16 seminomas in order to elucidate the pathogenesis of germ cell tumours in
  males. A characteristic pattern of losses and gains within the entire genomes was
  detected in 94 of the seminomas by comparing the ratio profiles of the tumours with
  a standard of cytogenetically normal genomic DNA. Losses represented 43 of the total
  number of alterations often affecting chromosomes and chromosome arms 4, 5, 11,
  13q, and 18q. Gains amounted to 57 and were often observed on 1q, 7, 8, 12, 14q,
  15q, 21q, and 22q. Aberrations of 12p and 21q appeared most consistently. Results
  from CGH analysis displayed no relationship to the clinical stages of the malignancy.
  Some rare aberrations appeared, however, only in clinical stage II and in tumours
  showing relapse in the contralateral testis following orchiectomy, although the
  alterations were not present in all of the tumours in question. Losses of 16q13-21
  and gains of 9q22.1-22.2 were demonstrated in both groups, while loss of 16p12 and
  gains of 6p21 and 6q23.3-24 were detected in the latter group as well. In conclusion,
  a specific pattern of chromosomal alterations was demonstrated in the seminomas
  by improved detection criteria, which increased specificity and sensitivity. The
  rare aberrations, which appeared only in tumours in improved detection criteria,
  which increased specificity and sensitivity. The rare aberrations, which appeared
  only in tumours in clinical stage II and relapsed tumours, may be linked to tumour
  progression, invasiveness, and bilateral disease.
