abstract: TP53 mutations play an important role in the development of several cancers
  and are present in 20-40 of all breast carcinomas, contributing to increased genomic
  instability. In order to address the relationship of mutated TP53 to genomic complexity,
  the present study analysed 61 breast carcinomas for TP53 mutations and compared
  mutation status with the pattern of genomic imbalances as assessed by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . Twenty per cent of the present series of breast carcinomas
  harboured TP53 mutations. An increasing number of abnormalities, as identified by
  CGH higher genomic complexity , correlated significantly with mutant TP53. Among
  the chromosome arms most commonly altered in more than 20 of the tumours , loss
  of 8p and gain of 8q were associated with TP53 mutations, whereas loss of 16q was
  associated with wild-type TP53. By performing supervised hierarchical clustering
  analysis of the CGH data, a cluster of chromosome imbalances was observed that showed
  differences between wild-type and mutant TP53 cases. Among these, loss of chromosome
  arm 5q revealed the strongest correlation with altered TP53. To investigate further
  the most commonly deleted region of 5q, gene expression patterns from two publicly
  available microarray data sets of breast carcinomas were evaluated statistically.
  The expression data sets identified potential target genes, including genes involved
  in ubiquitination and the known TP53 target CSPG2. The genomic complexity of breast
  carcinomas as assessed by CGH is associated with TP53 mutation status breast cancers
  with TP53 mutations display more complex genomes than do those with wild-type TP53.
  The pattern of genomic imbalances associated with mutant TP53 is non-random, with
  loss of chromosome arm 5q being particularly closely associated with TP53 mutations.
