abstract: A single nucleotide polymorphism-chip analysis of 98 cases of aggressive
  B-cell lymphomas revealed a recurrent deletion at 19p13 in nine of the cases. Six
  further cases with deletions encompassing this region were found in array-comparative
  genomic hybridization data of 295 aggressive B-cell lymphomas from a previous study.
  Three cases even showed a homozygous deletion, suggesting a tumor suppressor gene
  in the deleted region. Two genes encoding members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily
  TNFSF were located in the minimally deleted region, that is, TNFSF7 and TNFSF9.
  As no mutations were found within the coding exons of the remaining alleles in the
  lymphomas with heterozygous deletions, we speculate that the deletions may mostly
  function through a haploinsufficiency mechanism. The cases with deletions encompassed
  both diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and Burkitt lymphomas, and a deletion was also
  found in a Hodgkin lymphoma cell line. Thus, TNFSF7 and TNFSF9 deletions are recurrent
  genetic lesions in multiple types of human lymphomas.
