abstract: The mechanism of multistage carcinogenesis initiated by environmental carcinogens
  produces clonal evolution of initiated cells to the stage of metastasis. However,
  the simultaneous co-existence of various cell clones is not excluded. The analysis
  of chromosome alterations appears to be the best method to assess the clonal composition
  of a tumor.
