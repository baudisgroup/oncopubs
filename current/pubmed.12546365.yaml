abstract: Craniopharyngioma is the most common childhood brain tumor and is thought
  to arise from embryonic remnants of the Rathke pouch. Some craniopharyngiomas are
  monoclonal in origin and hence presumably harbor somatic genetic alterations, although
  the precise molecular mechanisms involved in craniopharyngioma development are unknown.
  The goal of this study was to identify genetic alterations in craniopharyngiomas.
