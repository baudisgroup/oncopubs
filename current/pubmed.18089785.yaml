abstract: Basal and luminal are two molecular subtypes of breast cancer with opposite
  histoclinical features. We report a combined, high-resolution analysis of genome
  copy number and gene expression in primary basal and luminal breast cancers. First,
  we identified and compared genomic alterations in 45 basal and 48 luminal tumors
  by using 244K oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH . We
  found various genome gains and losses and rare high-level gene amplifications that
  may provide therapeutic targets. We show that gain of 10p is a new alteration in
  basal breast cancer and that a subregion of the 8p12 amplification is specific of
  luminal tumors. Rare high-level amplifications contained BCL2L2, CCNE, EGFR, FGFR2,
  IGF1R, NOTCH2, and PIK3CA. Potential gene breaks involved ETV6 and FLT3. Second,
  we analyzed both aCGH and gene expression profiles for 42 basal and 32 luminal breast
  cancers. The results support the existence of specific oncogenic pathways in basal
  and luminal breast cancers, involving several potential oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes TSG . In basal tumors, 73 candidate oncogenes were identified in chromosome
  regions 1q21-23, 10p14, and 12p13 and 28 candidate TSG in regions 4q32-34 and 5q11-23.
  In luminal breast cancers, 33 potential oncogenes were identified in 1q21-23, 8p12-q21,
  11q13, and 16p12-13 and 61 candidate TSG in 16q12-13, 16q22-24, and 17p13. HORMAD1
  P 6.5 x 10 -5 and ZNF703 P 7 x 10 -4 were the most significant basal and luminal
  potential oncogenes, respectively. Finally, among 10p candidate oncogenes associated
  with basal subtype, we validated CDC123 C10orf7 protein as a basal marker.
