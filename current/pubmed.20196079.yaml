abstract: Recent studies have suggested that APC loss alone may be insufficient to
  promote aberrant Wnt beta-catenin signalling. Our aim was to comprehensively characterize
  Wnt signalling components in a set of APC-associated familial adenomatous polyposis
  FAP tumours. Sixty adenomas from six FAP patients with known pathogenic APC mutations
  were included. Somatic APC and KRAS mutations, beta-catenin immunostaining, and
  qRT-PCR of APC, MYC, AXIN2 and SFRP1 were analysed. Array-comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH was also assessed in 26 FAP adenomas and 24 paired adenoma-carcinoma samples.
  A somatic APC alteration was present in 15 adenomas LOH in 11 and four point mutations
  . KRAS mutations were detected in 10 of the cases. APC mRNA was overexpressed in
  adenomas. MYC and AXIN2 were also overexpressed, with significant intra-case heterogeneity.
  Increased cytoplasmic and or nuclear beta-catenin staining was seen in 94 and 80
  of the adenomas. beta-Catenin nuclear staining was strongly associated with MYC
  levels p value 0.03 but not with KRAS mutations. Copy number aberrations were rare.
  However, the recurrent chromosome changes observed more frequently contained Wnt
  pathway genes p value 0.012 . Based on beta-catenin staining and Wnt pathway target
  genes alterations the Wnt pathway appears to be constitutively activated in all
  APC-FAP tumours, with alterations occurring both upstream and downstream of APC.
  Wnt aberrations are present at both the DNA and the RNA level. Somatic profiling
  of APC-FAP tumours provides new insights into the role of APC in tumourigenesis.
