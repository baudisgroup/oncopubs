abstract: Deletions of chromosome 8p are a recurrent event in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
  B-NHL , suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene. We have characterized
  these deletions using comparative genomic hybridization to microarrays, fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH mapping, DNA sequencing, and functional studies. A minimal
  deleted region MDR of 600 kb was defined in chromosome 8p21.3, with one mantle cell
  lymphoma cell line Z138 exhibiting monoallelic deletion of 650 kb. The MDR extended
  from bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clones RP11-382J24 and RP11-109B10 and
  included the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL receptor
  gene loci. Sequence analysis of the individual expressed genes within the MDR and
  DNA sequencing of the entire MDR in Z138 did not reveal any mutation. Gene expression
  analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction QRT-PCR
  showed down-regulation of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 receptor genes as a consistent event
  in B-NHL with 8p21.3 loss. Epigenetic inactivation was excluded via promoter methylation
  analysis. In vitro studies showed that TRAIL-induced apoptosis was dependent on
  TRAIL-R1 and or -R2 dosage in most tumors. Resistance to apoptosis of cell lines
  with 8p21.3 deletion was reversed by restoration of TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 expression
  by gene transfection. Our data suggest that TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 act as dosage-dependent
  tumor suppressor genes whose monoallelic deletion can impair TRAIL-induced apoptosis
  in B-cell lymphoma.
