abstract: Primary brain tumors are the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in
  adults under the age of 54 years and the leading cause of cancer mortality in children
  in the United States. Therapy for the most common type of primary brain tumors,
  gliomas, remains suboptimal. The development of new and more effective treatments
  will likely require a better understanding of the biology of these tumors. Here,
  we show that use of the high-density 100K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays
  in a large number of primary tumor samples allows for a much higher resolution survey
  of the glioma genome than has been previously reported in any tumor type. We not
  only confirmed alterations in genomic areas previously reported to be affected in
  gliomas, but we also refined the location of those sites and uncovered multiple,
  previously unknown regions that are affected by copy number alterations amplifications,
  homozygous and heterozygous deletions as well as allelic imbalances loss of heterozygosity
  gene conversions . The wealth of genomic data produced may allow for the development
  of a more rational molecular classification of gliomas and serve as an important
  starting point in the search for new molecular therapeutic targets.
