abstract: Gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma comprises a distinct category of gastric
  cancers and has been reported to have poor prognosis. In an attempt to define genetic
  changes involved in the pathogenesis of this lesion in an in vivo state, we isolated
  signet-ring cell carcinoma cells from freshly fixed smears of tumor tissues of 7
  primary gastric signet-ring cell carcinomas by laser capture microdissection and
  applied comparative genomic hybridization CGH to screen for DNA sequence copy number
  changes. Frequent chromosomal gains were detected on 2q, 5p, 7q, 14q and 20q, each
  in 6 7 cases, on 9q, 12q, 17q, and 19q, each in 5 7 cases, and on 18p in 4 7 cases.
  Frequent losses were observed on 6p and 17p, each in 5 7 cases, on 6q, and 21p,
  each in 4 7 cases, and on 3p, 8p and 8q, each in 3 7 cases. Losses on 6p have rarely
  been observed in conventional types of gastric carcinomas reported in the literature.
  These data provide the first evidence for the occurrence of specific genomic aberrations
  in gastric signet-ring cell carcinomas. Our observation of frequent losses on 6p
  chromosomal arm may provide novel abnormalities of potential significance in gastric
  signet-ring cell carcinomas, suggesting the involvement of genes residing in this
  region in the genesis of the disease.
