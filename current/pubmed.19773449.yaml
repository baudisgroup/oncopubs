abstract: Androgen deprivation is the mainstay of therapy for progressive prostate
  cancer. Despite initial and dramatic tumor inhibition, most men eventually fail
  therapy and die of metastatic castration-resistant CR disease. Here, we characterize
  the profound degree of genomic alteration found in CR tumors using array comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH , gene expression arrays, and fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH . Bycluster analysis, we show that the similarity of the genomic
  profiles from primary and metastatic tumors is driven by the patient. Using data
  adjusted for this similarity, we identify numerous high-frequency alterations in
  the CR tumors, such as 8p loss and chromosome 7 and 8q gain. By integrating array
  CGH and expression array data, we reveal genes whose correlated values suggest they
  are relevant to prostate cancer biology. We find alterations that are significantly
  associated with the metastases of specific organ sites, and others with CR tumors
  versus the tumors of patients with localized prostate cancer not treated with androgen
  deprivation. Within the high-frequency sites of loss in CR metastases, we find an
  overrepresentation of genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism, including PTEN.
  Finally, using FISH, we verify the presence of a gene fusion between TMPRSS2 and
  ERG suggested by chromosome 21 deletions detected by array CGH. We find the fusion
  in 54 of our CR tumors, and 81 of the fusion-positive tumors contain cells with
  multiple copies of the fusion. Our investigation lays the foundation for a better
  understanding of and possible therapeutic targets for CR disease, the poorly responsive
  and final stage of prostate cancer.
