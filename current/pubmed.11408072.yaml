abstract: Malignant mesothelioma MM is predominantly a sporadic malignancy linked
  to exposure to asbestos. Clustering of MM in families suggests genetic susceptibility
  as a contributing factor. We performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis
  on tumor samples from members of a family with MM of the pleura and a history of
  parental cancer. Our specific aim was to find a recurrent copy number loss indicating
  the chromosomal area to which a gene underlying the development of MM could be assigned
  according to the Knudson two-hit hypothesis. We found losses at 1p, 6q, 9p, 13q,
  and 14q. The copy number changes were very similar to those reported in sporadic
  cases. Our findings and results from sporadic cases highlight the importance of
  cloning the genes in the loss sites at 1p, 6q, 14q, and 22q.
