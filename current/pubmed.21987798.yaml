abstract: Biallelic inactivation of cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 leads to breast
  and ovarian carcinogenesis. Paradoxically, BRCA1 deficiency in mice results in early
  embryonic lethality, and similarly, lack of BRCA1 in human cells is thought to result
  in cellular lethality in view of BRCA1s essential function. To survive homozygous
  BRCA1 inactivation during tumorigenesis, precancerous cells must accumulate additional
  genetic alterations, such as p53 mutations, but this requirement for an extra genetic
  amp quot hit amp quot contradicts the two-hit theory for the accelerated carcinogenesis
  associated with familial cancer syndromes. Here, we show that heterozygous BRCA1
  inactivation results in genomic instability in nontumorigenic human breast epithelial
  cells in vitro and in vivo. Using somatic cell gene targeting, we demonstrated that
  a heterozygous BRCA1 185delAG mutation confers impaired homology-mediated DNA repair
  and hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress. Heterozygous mutant BRCA1 cell clones
  also showed a higher degree of gene copy number loss and loss of heterozygosity
  in SNP array analyses. In BRCA1 heterozygous clones and nontumorigenic breast epithelial
  tissues from BRCA mutation carriers, FISH revealed elevated genomic instability
  when compared with their respective controls. Thus, BRCA1 haploinsufficiency may
  accelerate hereditary breast carcinogenesis by facilitating additional genetic alterations.
