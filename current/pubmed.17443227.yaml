abstract: Gross cytogenetic anomalies are traditionally being used as diagnostic,
  prognostic and therapeutic markers in the clinical management of cancer, including
  childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . Recently, it has become increasingly
  clear that genetic lesions driving tumorigenesis frequently occur at the submicroscopic
  level and, consequently, escape standard cytogenetic observations. Therefore, we
  profiled the genomes of 40 childhood ALLs at high resolution. We detected multiple
  de novo genetic lesions, including gross aneuploidies and segmental gains and losses,
  some of which were subtle and affected single genes. Many of these lesions involved
  recurrent partially overlapping deletions and duplications, containing various established
  leukemia-associated genes, such as ETV6, RUNX1 and MLL. Importantly, the most frequently
  affected genes were those controlling G1 S cell cycle progression e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN1B
  and RB1 , followed by genes associated with B-cell development. The latter group
  includes microdeletions of the B-lineage transcription factors PAX5, EBF, E2-2 and
  IKZF1 Ikaros , as well as genes with other established roles in B-cell development,
  that is RAG1 and RAG2, FYN, PBEF1 or CBP PAG. The fact that we frequently encountered
  multiple lesions affecting genes involved in cell cycle regulation and B-cell differentiation
  strongly suggests that both these processes need to be targeted independently and
  simultaneously to trigger ALL development.
