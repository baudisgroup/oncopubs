abstract: Most types of cancers are made up of heterogeneous mixtures of genetically
  distinct subclones. In particular, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been shown to
  undergo substantial clonal evolution over the course of the disease. AML tends to
  harbor fewer mutations than solid tumours, making it challenging to infer clonal
  structure. Here, we present a nine-year, whole-exome sequencing study of a single
  case at twelve time points, from the initial diagnosis until a 4th relapse, including
  six remission samples in-between. To the best of our knowledge, it covers the longest
  timespan of any dataset of its kind. We used this time series data to track the
  hierarchy and order of variant acquisition, and subsequently analyzed the evolution
  of somatic variants to infer clonal structure. From this, we postulate the development
  and extinction of subclones, as well as their anti-correlated expansion via varying
  drug responses. In particular, we show that new subclones started appearing after
  the 1st complete remission (CR). The presence and absence of different subclones
  during remission and relapses implies differing drug responses among subclones.
  Our study shows that time series analysis contrasting remission and relapse periods
  provides a much more comprehensive view of clonal structure and evolution.
