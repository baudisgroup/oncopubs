abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Five cell lines were established from a Singaporean patient
  of Chinese origin with breast ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS . These five cell lines
  express exogenous human telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT which confers the
  ability to proliferate indefinitely. METHODS: Cells were isolated from the DCIS
  excision and transfected with a plasmid expressing hTERT, a catalytic subunit of
  telomerase. Five immortalized colonies were propagated and characterized by karyotyping,
  array comparative genomic hybridization CGH , immunostaining and Western blots for
  biomarkers, in vitro anchorage independent growth, in vivo mouse tumorigenicity,
  drug sensitivity, species authentication and virology safety testing. RESULTS: Array
  CGH analysis showed that the cell lines harbored different specific genetic aberrations.
  Common mutations observed in most breast cancer cell lines such as the general loss
  of heterozygosity LOH throughout chromosome X and chromosome 17 are also observed
  in our cell lines. The cell lines were further characterized as human breast cells
  that are estrogen- and progesterone-receptor positive, and sensitive to tamoxifen.
  The cell lines showed anchorage-independent growth in the soft agar assay and can
  grow in common culture medium without supplementation with growth factor, therefore
  demonstrating transformed characteristics. Four of the cell lines can engraft and
  form measureable tumors after 50 days when injected subcutaneously into immune-deficient
  SCID mice. The weak tumorigenicity of these cell lines corresponded well with their
  non-malignant growth origin. The cell lines were authenticated to be of human origin
  based on DNA fingerprint of the cells. The cell lines were free from contamination
  of 20 viruses and mycoplasma in the virological safety test panel. CONCLUSIONS:
  Unlike most available breast cell lines, our cell lines are derived from primary
  breast cancer tissues that represent earlier grades or tumor progression stages.
  They would be useful as study models for basic and clinical research programs directed
  at early diagnosis and intervention.'
