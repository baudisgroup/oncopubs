abstract: Fanconi anemia FA is an inherited disease with congenital abnormalities
  and an extreme risk of acute myeloid leukemia AML . Genetic events occurring during
  malignant transformation in FA and the biology of FA-associated AML are poorly understood,
  but are often preceded by the development of chromosomal aberrations involving 3q26-29
  in bone marrow of FA patients. We report here the molecular cytogenetic characterization
  of FA-derived AML cell lines SB1685CB and SB1690CB by conventional and array comparative
  genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and SKY. We identified
  gains of a 3.7 MB chromosomal region on 3q26.2-26.31, which preceded transformation
  to overt leukemia. This region harbors the oncogenic transcription factor EVI1.
  A third FA-derived cell line, FA-AML1, carried a translocation with ectopic localization
  of 3q26 including EVI1. Rearrangements of 3q, which are rare in childhood AML, commonly
  result in overexpression of EVI1, which determines specific gene expression patterns
  and confers poor prognosis. We detected overexpression of EVI1 in all three FA-derived
  AML. Our results suggest a link between the FA defect, chromosomal aberrations involving
  3q and overexpression of EVI1. We hypothesize that constitutional or acquired FA
  defects might be a common factor for the development of 3q abnormalities in AML.
  In addition, cryptic imbalances as detected here might account for overexpression
  of EVI1 in AML without overt 3q26 rearrangements.
