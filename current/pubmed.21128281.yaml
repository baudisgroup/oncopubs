abstract: In the majority of colorectal cancers CRCs under clinical suspicion for
  a hereditary cause, the disease-causing genetic factors are still to be discovered.
  To identify such genetic factors we stringently selected a discovery cohort of 41
  CRC index patients with microsatellite-stable tumors. All patients were below 40
  years of age at diagnosis and or exhibited an overt family history. We employed
  genome-wide copy number profiling using high-resolution SNP arrays on germline DNA,
  which resulted in the identification of novel copy number variants CNVs in six patients
  15 encompassing, among others, the cadherin gene CDH18, the bone morphogenetic protein
  antagonist family gene GREM1, and the breakpoint cluster region gene BCR. In addition,
  two genomic deletions were encountered encompassing two microRNA genes, hsa-mir-491
  KIAA1797 and hsa-mir-646 AK309218. None of these CNVs has previously been reported
  in relation to CRC predisposition in humans, nor were they encountered in large
  control cohorts amp gt 1,600 unaffected individuals . Since several of these newly
  identified candidate genes may be functionally linked to CRC development, our results
  illustrate the potential of this approach for the identification of novel candidate
  genes involved in CRC predisposition.
