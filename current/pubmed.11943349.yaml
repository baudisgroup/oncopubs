abstract: Capillary hemangioblastomas CHB of the central nervous system, the most
  common tumor in von Hippel-Lindau VHL disease, usually show mutations in the VHL
  tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25-p26. Because little is known concerning
  the cytogenetic changes in these tumors, we studied 22 cases through comparative
  genomic hybridization to screen for DNA copy number changes in both sporadic and
  VHL-associated CHB. Our analysis revealed that 6 of 22 samples 27 contained DNA
  copy number losses, whereas no gains were observed. The most recurrent finding was
  loss of chromosomal arm 6q, seen in five cases. In two of these cases also loss
  of chromosome 3 was noted. The third aberration observed was loss of chromosome
  8, seen in one case. No differences were noted between VHL-associated and sporadic
  tumors, nor did the cytogenetic aberrations correlate with the clinical outcome.
  The loss of 6q, seen in this study and previously in other VHL-associated tumors
  renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas and other tumors, suggest that this
  chromosome area may contain tumor suppressor genes involved in the early steps of
  tumorigenesis.
