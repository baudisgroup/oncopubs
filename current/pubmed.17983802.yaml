abstract: The biological aggressiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and the lack
  of optimal therapeutic strategies have rendered the disease a major challenge. Highly
  heterogeneous genetic alteration profiles of HCC have made it difficult to identify
  effective tailor-made molecular therapeutic targets. Therefore, classification of
  HCC into genetically homogeneous subclasses would be of great worth to develop novel
  therapeutic strategies.
