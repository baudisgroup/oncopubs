abstract: Urothelial bladder cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Cancer cell
  lines are useful tools for its study. This is a comprehensive genomic characterization
  of 40 urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) cell lines including information on origin,
  mutation status of genes implicated in bladder cancer (FGFR3, PIK3CA, TP53, and
  RAS), copy number alterations assessed using high density SNP arrays, uniparental
  disomy (UPD) events, and gene expression.  Based on gene mutation patterns and genomic
  changes we identify lines representative of the FGFR3-driven tumor pathway and of
  the TP53/RB tumor suppressor-driven pathway. High-density array copy number analysis
  identified significant focal gains (1q32, 5p13.1-12, 7q11, and 7q33) and losses
  (i.e. 6p22.1) in regions altered in tumors but not previously described as affected
  in bladder cell lines. We also identify new evidence for frequent regions of UPD,
  often coinciding with regions reported to be lost in tumors. Previously undescribed
  chromosome X losses found in UBC lines also point to potential tumor suppressor
  genes. Cell lines representative of the FGFR3-driven pathway showed a lower number
  of UPD events.  Overall, there is a predominance of more aggressive tumor subtypes
  among the cell lines. We provide a cell line classification that establishes their
  relatedness to the major molecularly-defined bladder tumor subtypes. The compiled
  information should serve as a useful reference to the bladder cancer research community
  and should help to select cell lines appropriate for the functional analysis of
  bladder cancer genes, for example those being identified through massive parallel
  sequencing.
