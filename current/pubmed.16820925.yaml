abstract: 'Genetic etiology of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx SCCL is very
  complex, with both molecular and chromosomal alterations involved. The target genes
  have not yet been clearly identified. Therefore, our study focused on searching
  for regions that potentially harbor genes related to SCCL. After comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH analysis of a set of 52 SCCL we specified 13q21-q32 and 13q34
  as the most frequently deleted regions. In order to precisely map the critical region
  of deletion, we studied these areas by using 15 microsatellite markers. In our material
  a significantly high frequency of loss of heterozygosity LOH test for a difference
  in two proportions, p amp lt 0.001 was observed for the following markers: D13S1320
  13q21.1 , D13S800 13q21.3 , D13S1818 13q32.1 , D13S770 13q32.3 and D13S285 13q34
  . Three hot spots of LOH were found: 13q21.1-q22.1 D13S1320-D13S1824-D13S800-SHGC30014-
  WI-16413-D13S1186 , 13q.31.1-13q32.3 D13S317-D13S1818-D13S770 , 13q34 D13S285 .
  Among these areas, 13q31.1-q32.3 was identified as new hot spot of deletion in SCCLs.'
