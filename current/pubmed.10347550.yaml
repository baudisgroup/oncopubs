abstract: 'Regional chromosome localizations of DNA copy number imbalances were studied
  by comparative genomic hybridization in 30 malignant fibrous histiocytomas: 13 primary
  tumors 2 myxoid, 9 storiform pleomorphic, and 2 with more undifferentiated phenotype
  and 17 local recurrences 2 myxoid, 11 storiform pleomorphic, and 4 with more undifferentiated
  phenotype . Abnormal comparative genomic hybridization CGH profiles were observed
  in 25 tumors 83 . The most frequent gains ratio amp gt 1.2 corresponded, by order
  of frequency, to entire Xp, and bands 1q21, 19q13.1, 19p13, 5p13-p14, 1p31, 17p,
  18p, 20q, 1p35, 17q23, and 22q12. High levels of gains ratio amp gt 1.5 were recurrently
  detected for Xp 10 cases , and in bands 1q21-q22 8 cases , 3q27 4 cases , 5p13-p14
  3 cases , 13q32-q34 3 cases , 15q22-q26 3 cases , and 17p11-p12 3 cases . Losses
  of 13q12-q14 or 13q21 were observed in a large proportion of tumors 17 cases , suggesting
  that a gene localized in this region could act as a tumor suppressor gene. Losses
  of 11q23, 2q32, 11p13, 10p, 1q4, 9p2, 16q12, 4q3, 10q25, 3p23, 2p24, and 12p were
  also recurrently observed. Taken together, these results provide an overview of
  chromosome imbalances present in MFH, which could be of use for diagnostic purposes.
  They point to various chromosome regions which may harbor genes important for malignant
  fibrous histiocytomas MFH oncogenesis and progression.'
