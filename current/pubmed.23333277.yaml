abstract: Frequent discrepancies between preclinical and clinical results of anticancer
  agents demand a reliable translational platform that can precisely recapitulate
  the biology of human cancers. Another critical unmet need is the ability to predict
  therapeutic responses for individual patients. Toward this goal, we have established
  a library of orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft models using surgical samples
  of GBM patients. These patient-specific GBM xenograft tumors recapitulate histopathological
  properties and maintain genomic characteristics of parental GBMs in situ. Furthermore,
  in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors
  mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment
  of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified
  the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness
  of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent
  the preclinically and clinically valuable "patient tumor's phenocopy" that represents
  molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.
