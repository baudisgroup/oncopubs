abstract: The analysis of chromosomal imbalances in solid tumors using comparative
  genetic hybridization CGH has gained much attention. A survey of the literature
  suggests that CGH is more sensitive in detecting copy number aberrations than is
  karyotyping, although careful comparisons between CGH and cytogenetics have not
  been performed. Here, we compared cytogenetics and CGH in 29 invasive breast cancers
  after converting the karyotypes into net copy number gains and losses. We found
  15 tumors 56 with a significant agreement between the two methods and 12 tumors
  44 where the methods were in disagreement two cases failed CGH analysis . Interestingly,
  in 13 of the 15 tumors where the two methods were concordant, there was also a strong
  correlation between chromosome index and DNA index by flow cytometry. In the opposite
  situation, i.e., when chromosome and DNA indices were not matching, there was disagreement
  between cytogenetics and CGH in 10 of the 12 tumors. Of the discordant cases, all
  except one had a amp quot simple amp quot abnormal karyotype. Unresolved chromosomal
  aberrations marker chromosomes, homogeneously staining regions, double minutes could
  not completely explain the differences between CGH and karyotyping. A likely explanation
  for the discrepancies is that the methods analyzed different cell populations. Gains
  and losses found by CGH represented the predominant often aneuploid clone, whereas
  the abnormal, near-diploid karyotypes represented minor cell clone s , which, for
  unknown reasons, had a growth advantage in vitro.
