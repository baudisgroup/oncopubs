abstract: 'Allelic alterations of chromosomes 1 and 19 are frequent events in human
  diffuse gliomas and have recently proven to be strong predictors of chemotherapeutic
  response and prolonged survival in oligodendrogliomas Cairncross et al., 1998 Smith
  et al., submitted . Using 115 human diffuse gliomas, we localized regions of common
  allelic loss on chromosomes 1 and 19 and assessed the association of these deletion
  intervals with glioma histological subtypes. Further, we evaluated the capacity
  of multiple modalities to detect these alterations, including loss of heterozygosity
  LOH , fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , and comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . The correlation coefficients for detection of 1p and 19q alterations, respectively,
  between modalities were: 0.98 and 0.87 for LOH and FISH, 0.79 and 0.60 for LOH and
  CGH, and 0.79 and 0.53 for FISH and CGH. Minimal deletion regions were defined on
  19q13.3 D19S412-D19S596 and 1p D1S468-D1S1612 . Loss of the 1p36 region was found
  in 18 of astrocytomas 10 55 and in 73 24 33 of oligodendrogliomas P amp lt 0.0001
  , and loss of the 19q13.3 region was found in 38 21 55 of astrocytomas and 73 24
  33 of oligodendrogliomas P 0.0017 . Loss of both regions was found in 11 6 55 of
  astrocytomas and in 64 21 33 of oligodendrogliomas P amp lt 0.0001 . All gliomas
  with LOH on either 1p or 19q demonstrated loss of the corresponding FISH probe,
  1p36 or 19q13.3, suggesting not only locations of putative tumor suppressor genes,
  but also a simple assay for assessment of 1p and 19q alterations as diagnostic and
  prognostic markers.'
