abstract: The expression of apurinic apyrimidinic exonuclease 1 APEX1 in tumors has
  been linked with chemoresistance, radioresistance, and shorter patient survival
  times. We sought to gain insight into the role of APEX1 in human osteosarcoma by
  evaluation of gene copy number alterations and its protein expression in osteosarcoma
  patients treated at the Sarcoma Center of Tianjin Cancer Hospital Tianjin, China
  . To evaluate the gene copy number alterations of APEX1, we acquired 10 fresh tissue
  samples from 9 patients and performed whole-genome array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH . We next acquired formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissues
  from 57 well-annotated osteosarcoma cases and performed immunohistochemical analyses
  for APEX1. APEX1 gene amplification was observed in 50 5 10 of the osteosarcoma
  samples. The overexpression of APEX1 protein was detected in 64.9 37 57 of the osteosarcomas
  ranging from negative 35.1 , 20 57 , weakly positive 35.1 , 20 57 , moderate 14
  , 8 57 and strongly positive 15.8 , 9 57 . The APEX1 expression had significant
  correlation with osteosarcoma local recurrence and or metastasis. Moreover, multivariate
  analysis showed that APEX1 expression was an independent molecular predictor for
  disease-free survival of patients with osteosarcomas. Our study for the first time
  showed that APEX1 gene was amplified in osteosarcomas and that APEX1 expression
  was an independent predictor of the osteosarcoma local recurrence and or metastasis.
  Thus, APEX1 may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for
  osteosarcoma.
