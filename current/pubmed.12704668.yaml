abstract: 'Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we present a genome-wide
  screening of a mixed mesenchymal-epithelial hepatoblastoma, its recurrence and 2
  novel hepatoblastoma cell lines raised from the ascites, 18 HepU1 and 23 HepU2 months
  after diagnosis of a hepatoblastoma in a 35-month-old boy. Both cell lines were
  also characterized by GTG-banding, multicolor-fluorescence in situ hybridization
  M-FISH and multicolor banding M-Band . On the basis of CGH, we compared the cytogenetics
  of histologically different tumor areas of the parental tumor and its recurrence
  with the hepatoblastoma cell lines. We found different CGH profiles in the parental
  tumor rev ish enh 1q31-q32,8p,12,17,20,X , dim 4q34-q35,18q23 cp and its recurrence
  rev ish enh 8q24,17,Xq26-q28 , dim 7q11.2-q21,13q34 cp . Although both epithelial
  cell lines were obtained at different times and the clonal ancestor of HepU2 had
  been exposed to a higher cumulative dose of chemotherapy, HepU1 and HepU2 have an
  identical karyotype: 48-56,XY, Y,dup 2 q32-q34 ,t 3 4 q21 q34 , 8, 12, 13, 17, t
  18 19 q21 q , 20 cp and identical CGH profiles: rev ish enh 2q24-q33,8,12,13q,17,20
  , dim 4q34-q35,18q22-q23 . In common with previously described hepatoblastoma cell
  lines, HepU1 and HepU2 demonstrate a gain of chromosome 20. The in situ aberrations
  most closely resembling that of HepU1 and HepU2 were found in areas of fetal-embryonal
  differentiation of the primary tumor. Interestingly, both cell lines mimic this
  histology in their three-dimensional growth pattern in vitro. HepU1 and HepU2 are
  thus cytogenetically and phenotypically highly characteristic of fetal-embryonal
  hepatoblastoma.'
