abstract: 'We revisited the cytogenetic alterations of the cervical adenocarcinoma
  cell line HeLa through the use of spectral karyotyping SKY , comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH , and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . SKY analysis unequivocally
  characterized all abnormal chromosomes. Chromosomal breakpoints were primarily assigned
  by simultaneous assessment of SKY painted chromosomes and inverted 4,6-diamidino2-phenylindole
  banding from the same cell. Twenty clonally abnormal chromosomes were found. Comparison
  with previously reported HeLa G-banding karyotypes revealed a remarkably stable
  cytogenetic constitution because 18 of 20 markers that were found were present before.
  The classification of 12 markers was refined in this study. Our assignment of the
  remaining six markers was consistent with those described in the literature. The
  CGH map of chromosomal copy number gains and losses strikingly matched the SKY results
  and was, in a few instances, decisive for assigning breakpoints. The combined use
  of molecular cytogenetic methods SKY, CGH, and FISH with site-specific probes, in
  addition to inverted 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or conventional G-banding analysis,
  provides the means to fully assess the genomic abnormalities in cancer cells. Human
  papillomaviruses HPVs are frequently integrated into the cellular DNA in cervical
  cancers. We mapped by FISH five HPV18 integration sites: three on normal chromosomes
  8 at 8q24 and two on derivative chromosomes, der 5 t 5 22 8 qll q11q13 q24 and der
  22 t 8 22 q24 q13 , which have chromosome 8q24 material. An 8q24 copy number increase
  was detected by CGH. Dual-color FISH with a c-MYC probe mapping to 8q24 revealed
  colocalization with HPV18 at all integration sites, indicating that dispersion and
  amplification of the c-MYC gene sequences occurred after and was most likely triggered
  by the viral insertion at a single integration site. Numerical and structural chromosomal
  aberrations identified by SKY, genomic imbalances detected by CGH, as well as FISH
  localization of HPV18 integration at the c-MYC locus in HeLa cells are common and
  representative for advanced stage cervical cell carcinomas. The HeLa genome has
  been remarkably stable after years of continuous cultivation therefore, the genetic
  alterations detected may have been present in the primary tumor and reflect events
  that are relevant to the development of cervical cancer.'
