abstract: Identifying modifiers of glioma risk in patients with type I neurofibromatosis
  (NF1) could help support personalized tumor surveillance, advance understanding
  of gliomagenesis, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets. Here, we report
  genetic polymorphisms in the human adenylate cyclase gene adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8)
  that correlate with glioma risk in NF1 in a sex-specific manner, elevating risk
  in females while reducing risk in males. This finding extends earlier evidence of
  a role for cAMP in gliomagenesis based on results in a genetically engineered mouse
  model (Nf1 GEM). Thus, sexually dimorphic cAMP signaling might render males and
  females differentially sensitive to variation in cAMP levels. Using male and female
  Nf1 GEM, we found significant sex differences exist in cAMP regulation and in the
  growth-promoting effects of cAMP suppression. Overall, our results establish a sex-specific
  role for cAMP regulation in human gliomagenesis, specifically identifying ADCY8
  as a modifier of glioma risk in NF1.
