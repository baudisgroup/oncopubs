abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) occur at increased frequency
  in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), where they likely arise from
  benign plexiform neurofibroma precursors. While previous studies have employed a
  variety of discovery approaches to discover genes associated with MPNST pathogenesis,
  it is currently unclear what molecular events are associated with the evolution
  of MPNST from plexiform neurofibroma.  Whole exome sequencing was performed on biopsy
  materials representing plexiform neurofibroma (n=3), MPNST, and metastasis from
  a single individual with NF1 over a 14-year period. Additional validation cases
  were used to assess candidate genes involved in malignant progression, while a murine
  MPNST model was employed for functional analysis.  There was an increasing proportion
  of cells with a somatic NF1 gene mutation as the tumors progressed from benign to
  malignant, suggesting a clonal process in MPNST development. Copy number variations,
  including loss of one copy of the TP53 gene, were identified in the primary tumor
  and the metastatic lesion, but not in benign precursor lesions. A limited number
  of genes with non-synonymous somatic mutations (beta III-spectrin and ZNF208) were
  discovered, several of which were validated in additional primary and metastatic
  MPNST samples. Lastly, increased beta III-spectrin expression was observed in the
  majority of MPNSTs, and shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced murine MPNST growth in
  vivo.  Collectively, the ability to track the molecular evolution of MPNST in a
  single individual with NF1 offers new insights into the sequence of genetic events
  important for disease pathogenesis and progression for future mechanistic study.  Copyright
