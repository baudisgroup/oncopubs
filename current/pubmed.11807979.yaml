abstract: Spectral karyotyping SKY and comparative genomic hybridization CGH have
  greatly enhanced the resolution of cytogenetic analysis, enabling the identification
  of novel regions of rearrangement and amplification in tumor cells. Here we report
  the analysis of 10 malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL cell lines derived at the
  Ontario Cancer Institute OCI , Toronto, designated as OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly2, OCI-Ly3,
  OCI-LY4, OCI-Ly7, OCI-Ly8, OCI-Ly12, OCI-Ly13.2, OCI-Ly17, and OCI-Ly18, by G-banding,
  SKY, and CGH, and we present their comprehensive cytogenetic profiles. In contrast
  to the 52 breakpoints identified by G-banding, SKY identified 87 breakpoints, which
  clustered at 1q21, 7p15, 8p11, 13q21, 13q32, 14q32, 17q11, and 18q21. G-banding
  identified 10 translocations, including the previously described recurring translocations,
  t 8 14 q24 q32 and t 14 18 q32 q21 . In contrast, SKY identified 60 translocations,
  including five that were recurring, t 8 14 q24 q32 , t 14 18 q32 q21 , t 4 7 p12
  q22 , t 11 18 q22 q21 , and t 3 18 q21 p11 . SKY also identified the source of all
  the marker chromosomes. In addition, 10 chromosomes that were classified as normal
  by G-banding were found by SKY to be rearranged. CGH identified seven sites of high-level
  DNA amplification, 1q31-32, 2p12-16, 8q24, 11q23-25, 13q21-22, 13q32-34, and 18q21-23
  of these, 1q31-32, 11q23-25, 13q21-22, and 13q32-34 have previously not been described
  as amplified in NHL. This comprehensive cytogenetic characterization of 10 NHL cell
  lines identified novel sites of rearrangement and amplification it also enhances
  their value in experimental studies aimed at gene discovery and gene function.
