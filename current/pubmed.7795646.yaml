abstract: Overexpression of amplified genes is often associated with the acquisition
  of resistance to cancer therapeutic agents in vitro. We have identified a similar
  molecular mechanism in vivo for endocrine treatment failure in human prostate cancer
  which involves amplification of the androgen receptor AR gene. Comparative genomic
  hybridization shows that amplification of the Xq11-q13 region the location , is
  common in tumours recurring during androgen deprivation therapy. We found high-level
  AR amplification in seven of 23 30 recurrent tumours, but in none of the specimens
  taken from the same patients prior to therapy. Our results suggest that AR amplification
  emerges during androgen deprivation therapy by facilitating tumour cell growth in
  low androgen concentrations.
