abstract: Malignant mesothelioma MM is an aggressive neoplasm associated with asbestos
  exposure. We carried out genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis with 14 MM cell lines. Three cell lines showed overlapping homozygous deletion
  at chromosome 13q12, which harbored the LATS2 large tumor suppressor homolog 2 gene.
  With 6 other MM cell lines and 25 MM tumors, we found 10 inactivating homozygous
  deletions or mutations of LATS2 among 45 MMs. LATS2 encodes a serine threonine kinase,
  a component of the Hippo tumor-suppressive signaling pathway, and we transduced
  LATS2 in MM cells with its mutation. Transduction of LATS2 inactivated oncoprotein
  YAP, a transcriptional coactivator, via phosphorylation, and inhibited MM cell growth.
  We also analyzed LATS2 immunohistochemically and found that 13 of 45 MM tumors had
  low expression of LATS2. Because NF2 is genetically mutated in 40 to 50 of MM, our
  data indicate that Hippo pathway dysregulation is frequent in MM cells with inactivation
  of LATS2 or an upstream regulator of this pathway, Merlin, which is encoded by NF2.
  Thus, our results suggest that the inactivation of LATS2 is one of the key mechanisms
  for constitutive activation of YAP, which induces deregulation of MM cell proliferation.
