abstract: Simultaneous independent primary tumors of the female genital tract occur
  in 1-2 of gynecological cancer patients, 50-70 of which are synchronous tumors of
  the endometrium and ovary. Guidelines for determining the nature of simultaneously
  detected tumors, based on surgical and histopathological findings, are often ambiguous
  and may require further molecular analyses. Such approach is necessary to indicate
  correct prognosis and hence treatment. We here demonstrate how mitochondrial DNA
  sequencing may provide a cheap and useful tool to contribute to indisputably recognize
  the synchronous nature of simultaneously detected endometrial and ovarian carcinomas.
  We further confirm our findings by means of Comparative Genomic Hybridization array
  analysis, which strengthens the informative potential of mitochondrial DNA genotyping
  in diagnosing synchrony.
