abstract: The diagnosis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma SMZL is frequently a challenge,
  due to its lack of specific histological features and immunophenotypic markers,
  and the existence of other poorly characterized splenic lymphomas defying classification.
  Moreover, the clinical outcome of SMZL is variable, with 30 of cases pursuing an
  aggressive clinical course, the prediction of which remains problematic. Thus, there
  is a real need for biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostication of SMZL. To search
  for genetic markers, we comprehensively investigated the genomic profile, TP53 abnormalities,
  and immunoglobulin heavy gene IGH mutation in a large cohort of SMZLs. 1 Mb resolution
  array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH on 25 SMZLs identified 7q32 deletion
  44 as the most frequent copy number change, followed by gains of 3q 32 , 8q 20 ,
  9q34 20 , 12q23-24 8 , and chromosome 18 12 , and losses of 6q 16 , 8p 12 , and
  17p 8 . High-resolution chromosome 7 tile-path aCGH on 17 SMZLs with 7q32 deletion
  identified by 1 Mb aCGH or interphase FISH screening mapped the minimal common deletion
  to a 3 Mb region at 7q32.1-32.2. Although it is not yet possible to identify the
  genes targeted by the deletion, interphase FISH screening showed that the deletion
  was seen in SMZL 19 56 34 and splenic B-cell lymphoma leukaemia unclassifiable 3
  9 33 , but not in 39 cases of other splenic lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic
  leukaemia n 14 , hairy cell leukaemia 4 , mantle cell lymphoma 12 , follicular lymphoma
  6 , and others. In SMZL, 7q32 deletion was inversely correlated with trisomy 18,
  but not associated with other copy number changes, TP53 abnormalities, or IGH mutation
  status. None of the genetic parameters examined showed significant and independent
  association with overall or event-free survival. In conclusion, 7q32 deletion is
  a characteristic feature of SMZL, albeit seen in isolated cases of splenic B-cell
  lymphoma leukaemia unclassifiable, and its detection may help the differential diagnosis
  of splenic B-cell lymphomas.
