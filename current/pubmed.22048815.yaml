abstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with known expression-defined tumor
  subtypes. DNA copy number studies have suggested that tumors within gene expression
  subtypes share similar DNA Copy number aberrations (CNA) and that CNA can be used
  to further sub-divide expression classes. To gain further insights into the etiologies
  of the intrinsic subtypes, we classified tumors according to gene expression subtype
  and next identified subtype-associated CNA using a novel method called SWITCHdna,
  using a training set of 180 tumors and a validation set of 359 tumors. Fisher's
  exact tests, Chi-square approximations, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed
  to evaluate differences in CNA by subtype. To assess the functional significance
  of loss of a specific chromosomal region, individual genes were knocked down by
  shRNA and drug sensitivity, and DNA repair foci assays performed. Most tumor subtypes
  exhibited specific CNA. The Basal-like subtype was the most distinct with common
  losses of the regions containing RB1, BRCA1, INPP4B, and the greatest overall genomic
  instability. One Basal-like subtype-associated CNA was loss of 5q11-35, which contains
  at least three genes important for BRCA1-dependent DNA repair (RAD17, RAD50, and
  RAP80); these genes were predominantly lost as a pair, or all three simultaneously.
  Loss of two or three of these genes was associated with significantly increased
  genomic instability and poor patient survival. RNAi knockdown of RAD17, or RAD17/RAD50,
  in immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines caused increased sensitivity
  to a PARP inhibitor and carboplatin, and inhibited BRCA1 foci formation in response
  to DNA damage. These data suggest a possible genetic cause for genomic instability
  in Basal-like breast cancers and a biological rationale for the use of DNA repair
  inhibitor related therapeutics in this breast cancer subtype.
