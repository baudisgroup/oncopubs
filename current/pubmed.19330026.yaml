abstract: Co-amplification at chromosomes 8p11-8p12 and 11q12-11q14 occurs often in
  breast tumors, suggesting possible cooperation between genes in these regions in
  oncogenesis. We used high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization array
  CGH to map the minimal amplified regions. The 8p and 11q amplicons are complex and
  consist of at least four amplicon cores at each site. Candidate oncogenes mapping
  to these regions were identified by combining copy number and RNA and protein expression
  analyses. These studies also suggested that CCND1 at 11q13 induced expression of
  ZNF703 mapping at 8p12, which was subsequently shown to be mediated by the Rb E2F
  pathway. Nine candidate oncogenes from 8p12 and four from 11q13 were further evaluated
  for oncogenic function. None of the genes individually promoted colony formation
  in soft agar or collaborated with each other functionally. On the other hand, FGFR1
  and DDHD2 at 8p12 cooperated functionally with MYC, whereas CCND1 and ZNF703 cooperated
  with a dominant negative form of TP53. These observations highlight the complexity
  and functional consequences of the genomic rearrangements that occur in these breast
  cancer amplicons, including transcriptional cross-talk between genes in the 8p and
  11q amplicons, as well as their cooperation with major pathways of tumorigenesis.
