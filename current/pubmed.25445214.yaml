abstract: PCR-based detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in neuroblastoma is
  currently based on RNA markers; however, expression of these targets can vary, and
  only paired-like homeobox 2b has no background expression. We investigated whether
  chromosomal breakpoints, identified by whole-genome sequencing (WGS), can be used
  as patient-specific DNA MRD markers. WGS data were used to develop large numbers
  of real-time PCRs specific for tumors of eight patients. These PCRs were used to
  quantify chromosomal breakpoints in primary tumor and bone marrow samples. Finally,
  the DNA breakpoints with the highest abundance were compared with a panel of RNA
  markers. By WGS we identified 42 chromosomal breakpoints in tumor samples from eight
  patients and developed specific quantitative real-time PCRs for each breakpoint.
  The tumor-specific breakpoints were all present in bone marrow at diagnosis. For
  one patient slight clonal selection was observed in response to treatment. Positivity
  of DNA MRD markers preceded disease progression in four of five patients; in one
  patient the RNA markers remained negative. For 16 of 22 samples MRD levels determined
  by RNA and DNA were comparable and in 6 of 22 samples higher MRD levels were detected
  by DNA markers. DNA breakpoints used as MRD targets in neuroblastoma are reliable
  and stable markers. In addition, this technique might be applicable for detecting
  tumor cells in other types of cancer.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 American Society for Investigative
