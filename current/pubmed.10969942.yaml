abstract: Medulloblastomas and related primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETs of the
  central nervous system are malignant, invasive embryonal tumors with predominantly
  neuronal differentiation that comprise 20 of pediatric brain tumors. Cytogenetic
  analysis has shown that alterations in chromosome 17, particularly the loss of 17p
  and the formation of isochromosome 17q, as well as the gain of chromosome 7 are
  the most common changes among this group of tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH studies have largely confirmed these cytogenetic findings and have also identified
  novel regions of gain, loss, and amplification. The advent of more sophisticated
  multicolored fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH procedures such as spectral
  karyotyping SKY now permits complete recognition of all aberrations including extremely
  complex rearrangements. The authors report a retrospective analysis of 19 medulloblastoma
  and five PNET cases studied using combinations of classic banding analysis, FISH,
  CGH, and SKY to examine comprehensively the chromosomal aberrations present in this
  tumor group and to attempt to identify common structural rearrangement s .
