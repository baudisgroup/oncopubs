abstract: Field cancerization is an accepted model for oral carcinogenesis. So far,
  genetically altered fields have been just reported in the presence of carcinomas.
  This study assessed the distant mirror fields MFs of oral precancer by DNA high-resolution
  flow cytometry hr DNA-FCM and array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization a-CGH .
