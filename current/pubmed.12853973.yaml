abstract: Tumors with defects in mismatch repair MMR show fewer chromosomal changes
  by cytogenetic analyses than most solid tumors, suggesting that a greater proportion
  of the alterations required for malignancy occur in genes with nucleotide sequences
  susceptible to errors normally corrected by MMR. Here, we used genome-wide microarray
  comparative genomic hybridization to carry out a higher resolution evaluation of
  the effect of MMR competence on genomic alterations occurring in 20 cell lines and
  to determine if characteristic aberrations arise in MMR-proficient and -deficient
  HCT116 cells undergoing selection for methotrexate resistance. We observed different
  spectra of aberrations in MMR-proficient compared to -deficient cell lines, as well
  as among cell lines with different types of MMR-deficiency. We also observed different
  genetic routes to drug resistance. Resistant MMR-deficient cells most frequently
  displayed no copy number alterations 16 29 cell pools , whereas all MMR-proficient
  cells had unique abnormalities involving chromosome 5, including amplicons centered
  on the target gene, DHFR and or a neighboring novel locus 7 13 pools . These observations
  support the concept that tumor genomes are shaped by selection for alterations that
  promote survival and growth advantage, as well as by the particular dysfunctions
  in genes responsible for maintenance of genetic integrity.
