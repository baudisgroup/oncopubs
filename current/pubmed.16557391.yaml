abstract: To optimize treatment strategies for patients with glioblastoma, a more
  precise understanding of the molecular basis of this disease clearly is necessary.
  Therefore, numerous studies have focused on the molecular biology of glioblastoma
  and its linkage to clinical behavior. Here we investigated 70 glioblastomas using
  the array-based comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH with GenoSensor Array
  300 to identify recurrent DNA copy number imbalances associated with patient outcomes.
  Univariate log-rank analysis of array-CGH data revealed 46 copy number aberrations
  CNAs associated with outcome. Among them, 26 CNAs were associated with shortened
  survival whereas the remaining 20 CNAs correlated with good prognosis. A hierarchical
  cluster analysis disclosed two genetically distinct groups of glioblastomas 1 and
  2 56 and 14 tumors, respectively . Univariate log-rank test discerned significant
  difference in survival between both genetic subsets while the 5-year survival rate
  consisted of 0 for group 1 and 63 for group 2. Multivariate analysis revealed that
  unfavorable genetic signature is an independent prognostic factor increasing a risk
  of patient death hazard ratio, 4.38 P 0.00001 . In conclusion, our current study
  suggests that glioblastomas can be subdivided into clinically relevant genetic subsets.
  Therefore, array-CGH screening of glioblastomas could provide clinically useful
  information and, perhaps, potentially improve the quality of treatment.
