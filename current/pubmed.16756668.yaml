abstract: Advances made in the area of microarray comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH have enabled the interrogation of the entire genome at a previously unattainable
  resolution. This has lead to the discovery of a novel class of alternative entities
  called large-scale copy number variations CNVs . These CNVs are often found in regions
  of closely linked sequence homology called duplicons that are thought to facilitate
  genomic rearrangements in some classes of neoplasia. Recently, it was proposed that
  duplicons located near the recurrent translocation break points on chromosomes 9
  and 22 in chronic myeloid leukemia CML may facilitate this tumor-specific translocation.
  Furthermore, approximately 15-20 of CML patients also carry a microdeletion on the
  derivative 9 chromosome der 9 and these patients have a poor prognosis. It has been
  hypothesised that der 9 deletion patients have increased levels of chromosomal instability.
