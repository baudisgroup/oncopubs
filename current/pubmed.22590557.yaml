abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) has extreme genetic variation among patients,
  which is currently not well understood, limiting progress in therapy development
  and research. LAD intrinsic molecular subtypes are a validated stratification of
  naturally-occurring gene expression patterns and encompass different functional
  pathways and patient outcomes. Patients may have incurred different mutations and
  alterations that led to the different subtypes. We hypothesized that the LAD molecular
  subtypes co-occur with distinct mutations and alterations in patient tumors.The
  LAD molecular subtypes (Bronchioid, Magnoid, and Squamoid) were tested for association
  with gene mutations and DNA copy number alterations using statistical methods and
  published cohorts (n = 504). A novel validation (n = 116) cohort was assayed and
  interrogated to confirm subtype-alteration associations. Gene mutation rates (EGFR,
  KRAS, STK11, TP53), chromosomal instability, regional copy number, and genomewide
  DNA methylation were significantly different among tumors of the molecular subtypes.
  Secondary analyses compared subtypes by integrated alterations and patient outcomes.
  Tumors having integrated alterations in the same gene associated with the subtypes,
  e.g. mutation, deletion and underexpression of STK11 with Magnoid, and mutation,
  amplification, and overexpression of EGFR with Bronchioid. The subtypes also associated
  with tumors having concurrent mutant genes, such as KRAS-STK11 with Magnoid. Patient
  overall survival, cisplatin plus vinorelbine therapy response and predicted gefitinib
  sensitivity were significantly different among the subtypes.The lung adenocarcinoma
  intrinsic molecular subtypes co-occur with grossly distinct genomic alterations
  and with patient therapy response. These results advance the understanding of lung
  adenocarcinoma etiology and nominate patient subgroups for future evaluation of
  treatment response.
