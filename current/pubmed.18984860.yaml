abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is genetically characterized by the t 11 14 q13
  q32 translocation and a high number of secondary chromosomal alterations. However,
  only a limited number of target genes have been identified. We have studied 10 MCL
  cell lines and 28 primary tumors with a combination of a high-density single-nucleotide
  polymorphism array and gene expression profiling. We detected highly altered genomes
  in the majority of the samples with a high number of partial uniparental disomies
  UPDs . The UPD at 17p was one of the most common, and it was associated with TP53
  gene inactivation. Homozygous deletions targeted 4 known tumor suppressor genes
  CDKN2C, BCL2L11, CDKN2A, and RB1 and 6 new genes FAF1, MAP2, SP100, MOBKL2B, ZNF280A,
  and PRAME . Gene amplification coupled with overexpression was identified in 35
  different regions. The most recurrent amplified regions were 11q13.3-q13.5, 13q31.3,
  and 18q21.33, which targeted CCND1, C13orf25, and BCL2, respectively. Interestingly,
  the breakpoints flanking all the genomic alterations, including UPDs, were significantly
  associated with genomic regions enriched in copy number variants and segmental duplications,
  suggesting that the recombination at these regions may play a role in the genomic
  instability of MCL. This integrative genomic analysis has revealed target genes
  that may be potentially relevant in MCL pathogenesis.
