abstract: Distinguishing between Spitz nevus and melanoma presents a challenging task
  for clinicians and pathologists. Most of these lesions are submitted entirely in
  formalin for histologic analysis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections,
  and fresh-frozen material for ancillary studies is rarely collected. Molecular techniques,
  such as comparative genomic hybridization CGH , can detect chromosomal alterations
  in tumor DNA that differ between these 2 lesions. This study investigated the ability
  of high-resolution array-based CGH to serve as a diagnostic test in distinguishing
  Spitz nevus and melanoma using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
  samples. Two of 3 Spitz nevi exhibited no significant chromosomal alterations, while
  the third showed gain of the short arm of chromosome 11p. The latter finding has
  previously been described as characteristic of a subset of Spitz nevi. The 2 melanomas
  showed multiple copy number alterations characteristic of melanoma such as 1q amplification
  and chromosome 9 deletion. This study has shown the utility of array-based CGH as
  a potential molecular test in distinguishing Spitz nevus from melanoma. The assay
  is capable of using archival paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed material is technically
  easier to perform as compared with conventional CGH is more sensitive than conventional
  CGH in being able to detect focal alterations and can detect copy number alterations
  even with relatively small amounts of lesional tissue as is typical of many skin
  tumors.
