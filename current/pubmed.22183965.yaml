abstract: Next generation sequencing has enabled systematic discovery of mutational
  spectra in cancer samples. Here, we used whole genome sequencing to characterize
  somatic mutations and structural variation in a primary acral melanoma and its lymph
  node metastasis. Our data show that the somatic mutational rates in this acral melanoma
  sample pair were more comparable to the rates reported in cancer genomes not associated
  with mutagenic exposure than in the genome of a melanoma cell line or the transcriptome
  of melanoma short-term cultures. Despite the perception that acral skin is sun-protected,
  the dominant mutational signature in these samples is compatible with damage due
  to ultraviolet light exposure. A nonsense mutation in ERCC5 discovered in both the
  primary and metastatic tumors could also have contributed to the mutational signature
  through accumulation of unrepaired dipyrimidine lesions. However, evidence of transcription-coupled
  repair was suggested by the lower mutational rate in the transcribed regions and
  expressed genes. The primary and the metastasis are highly similar at the level
  of global gene copy number alterations, loss of heterozygosity and single nucleotide
  variation SNV . Furthermore, the majority of the SNVs in the primary tumor were
  propagated in the metastasis and one nonsynonymous coding SNV and one splice site
  mutation appeared to arise de novo in the metastatic lesion.
