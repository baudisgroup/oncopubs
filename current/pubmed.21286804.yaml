abstract: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 explain approximately 25 of all familial
  breast cancers. Despite intense efforts to find additional high-risk breast cancer
  genes BRCAx using linkage analysis, none have been reported thus far. Here we explore
  the hypothesis that BRCAx breast tumors from genetically related patients share
  a somatic genetic etiology that might be revealed by array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH profiling. As BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors can be identified on the basis of specific
  genomic profiles, the same may be true for a subset of BRCAx families. Analyses
  used aCGH to compare 58 non-BRCA1 2 familial breast tumors designated BRCAx to sporadic
  non-familiar controls, BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors. The selection criteria for BRCAx
  families included at least three cases of breast cancer diagnosed before the age
  of 60 in the family, and the absence of ovarian or male breast cancer. Hierarchical
  cluster analysis was performed to determine sub-groups within the BRCAx tumor class
  and family heterogeneity. Analysis of aCGH profiles of BRCAx tumors indicated that
  they constitute a heterogeneous class, but are distinct from both sporadic and BRCA1
  2 tumors. The BRCAx class could be divided into sub-groups. One subgroup was characterized
  by a gain of chromosome 22. Tumors from family members were classified within the
  same sub-group in agreement with the hypothesis that tumors from the same family
  would harbor a similar genetic background. This approach provides a method to target
  a sub-group of BRCAx families for further linkage analysis studies.
