abstract: Breast tumor development and progression are thought to be driven by an
  accumulation of genetic alterations, but little is known about the specific changes
  that occur during the metastatic process. We analyzed pairs of primary breast cancers
  and their matched lymph node metastases from 11 patients, pairs of primaries and
  distant metastases from three patients, and pairs of primaries, and local recurrences
  from two patients by using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Simultaneous
  hybridization analysis of primary versus matched lesion DNAs from 11 patients was
  also performed modified CGH . This modified approach was useful not only for confirming
  CGH results but also for demonstrating quantitative differences between aberrations
  present at both sites. Frequent chromosomal changes present at both sites amp gt
  35 of 16 cases were 1q, 8q, and 17q gains and 6q, 8p, 9q, 13q, 16q, 17p, and Xp
  losses. The total number of aberrations detected exclusively in the lymph nodes
  or distant metastases was higher than that in the primary tumors 2.5 vs. 0.7, P
  amp lt 0.05 . We found high-level amplifications in four metastases two lymph nodes
  and two distant metastases , but none in any primary tumor. These findings suggest
  that progression from primary breast cancer to metastasis may be associated with
  the acquisition of further genetic changes. Although further investigations are
  required, it was of interest that 3 of 11 patients 27 showed 18q loss solely in
  their lymph node metastases.
