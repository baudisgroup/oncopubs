abstract: Gastric adenoma is a precancerous lesion of the stomach and its malignant
  transformation is thought to result from accumulative series of gene alterations.
  The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of chromosomal changes during
  gastric carcinogenesis. Pairs of adenoma and carcinoma tissues from 15 gastrectomy
  cases containing both adenomas and carcinomas in the same adjacent pairs, 6 cases
  and different non-adjacent pairs, 9 cases lesions, were analyzed for chromosomal
  alterations of 39 non-acrocentric chromosomal arms by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . CGH analysis identified frequent chromosomal alterations in most of the gastric
  adenomas 14 15, 93 and all of the carcinomas. The mean number of chromosomal alterations
  was higher in carcinoma 5.5 for adenoma and 11.7 for carcinoma P 0.006, by nonparametric
  Wilcoxons test . Losses on the short arm of chromosome 17 were most common in both
  adenomas 43 and carcinomas 67 . The pattern of chromosomal alterations in paired
  gastric adenomas and carcinomas showed greater similarity compared to the non-case
  pairs and this similarity was increased in the adjacent pairs. Deletion mapping
  analysis on chromosome 17p also demonstrated that the conserved deletion area was
  more frequent in the adjacent pairs. Among these 6 adjacent pairs, all had common
  deletion areas. In contrast, among the 9 non-adjacent pairs, 2 22 had common area
  of deletion, 5 56 showed deletion only in the carcinoma, and the remaining 2 22
  had no deletion on 17p, suggesting diverse genetic changes might be involved in
  the multiple tumor formation. Our results that common clonal genetic changes between
  adjacent pairs of gastric adenomas and carcinomas and accumulated genetic changes
  in the carcinomas provide evidences for the stepwise mode of gastric carcinogenesis
  through the accumulation of a series of genetic alterations.
