abstract: We combined laser-assisted microdissection from H amp amp E-stained paraffin
  sections, degenerated oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR ,
  and comparative genomic hybridization CGH to analyse chromosomal imbalances in small
  tumour areas consisting of 50-100 cells. This approach was used to investigate intratumour
  genetic heterogeneity in a case of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma and chromosomal
  changes in areas of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia PIN adjacent to the invasive
  tumour. In four microdissected invasive tumour areas with different histological
  patterns acinar, cribriform, papillary and solid marked intratumour heterogeneity
  was found by CGH. Recurrent chromosomal imbalances detected in at least two microdissected
  tumour areas were gains on 1p32-- amp gt p36, 2p22, 3q21, 7, 8q21-- amp gt q24,
  11q12-- amp gt q13, 16p12-- amp gt p13, 17, 19 and loss on 16q23. Additional chromosomal
  changes were found in only one of the microdissected areas gains on 16q21-- amp
  gt q23, 20q22 and losses on 8p21-- amp gt p23, 12p11-- amp gt q12, 12q21-- amp gt
  q26, 13q21-- amp gt q34, 16q12, and 18q22 . In PIN, gains on chromosomes 8q21--
  amp gt q24 and 17 were found in both samples investigated low and high grade PIN
  , while gains on chromosomes 7, 11q, 12q, 16p, and 20q and losses on 2p, 8p21--
  amp gt p23, 12q were found only in one PIN area. Controls to ensure reliable CGH
  results consisted in CGH analyses of i approximately 80 microdissected normal epithelial
  cells, which showed no aberrations after DOP-PCR and ii larger cell numbers approximately
  10 5 or 10 7 cells of the primary tumour investigated without DOP-PCR and partially
  displaying the chromosomal imbalances gain on 16p12-- amp gt p13, losses on 2p25,
  8p21-- amp gt p23, 12p11-- amp gt p12, 12q21-- amp gt q26, 18q22 found in the small
  microdissected areas. Microsatellite and FISH analyses further confirmed our CGH
  results from microdissected cells. The combined approach of laser-assisted microdissection,
  DOP-PCR and CGH is suitable to identify early genetic changes in PIN and chromosomal
  imbalances associated with the particular histological patterns of invasive prostatic
  adenocarcinoma.
