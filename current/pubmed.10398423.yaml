abstract: It is unclear whether ovarian borderline tumors tumors of low malignant
  potential are independent entities or whether they are part of a continuum of tumor
  progression that culminates in ovarian carcinoma. Little is known about genetic
  abnormalities in borderline tumors because of the difficulty of growing them in
  culture for chromosome studies, and because the low ratio of tumor to nontumor cells
  can interfere with molecular genetic examination. To circumvent these problems,
  we performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH on 10 serous borderline tumors
  from nine patients, using microdissection to enrich the samples for tumor DNA and
  reduce contamination from stromal and inflammatory cells. CGH analysis revealed
  that three of the tumors had detectable chromosomal imbalances, whereas seven were
  in a balanced state. In those tumors with imbalances, the number of abnormalities
  ranged from 3-6 per tumor. Additional studies by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH on disaggregated nuclei confirmed the imbalances detected by CGH, revealed
  one tumor to be hypertriploid, and indicated that the remaining tumors were diploid
  and in a balanced state. All abnormalities observed in the aneuploid cases are consistent
  with chromosomal aberrations previously reported for ovarian carinomas, providing
  further evidence that some borderline tumors are part of a continuum of tumor progression.
  These results also suggest that there may be different mechanisms leading to borderline
  tumor formation, including one associated with multiple chromosomal imbalances,
  and others that do not involve imbalances detectable by CGH. Genes Chromosomes Cancer
