abstract: Solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas HNSCC , arise
  as a result of genetic and epigenetic alterations in a sustained stress environment.
  Little work has been done that simultaneously examines the spectrum of both types
  of changes in human tumors on a genome-wide scale and results so far have been limited
  and mixed. Since it has been hypothesized that epigenetic alterations may act by
  providing the second carcinogenic hit in gene silencing, we sought to identify genome-wide
  DNA copy number alterations and CpG dinucleotide methylation events and examine
  the global local relationships between these types of alterations in HNSCC.
