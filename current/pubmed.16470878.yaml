abstract: Oral cancer typically affects smokers older than 50 years of age. Recently,
  however, a marked increase in the number of patients 40 years old and younger, many
  with no history of tobacco smoking, has been noted. Studies in this age group have
  so far been restricted to genomic areas well recognized as abnormal in typical patients
  with oral cancer. The aim of this study was to assess genomic aberrations in oral
  cancer, using comparative genomic hybridization CGH microarray technology, and to
  compare the genomic aberration profile of patients older than 40 years old with
  those 40 years old and younger.
