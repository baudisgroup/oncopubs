abstract: The aim of this study was to determine genetic alterations in mucoepidermoid
  carcinomas of the salivary gland in association with clinical and histopathological
  parameters. Nineteen formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were analysed by using
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH , fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  on interphase nuclei and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR
  for detection of MECT1-MAML2 fusion transcript. The CGH analysis showed an overrepresentation
  of chromosome X and losses of entire chromosomes or regions on chromosome 1, 2,
  and 15 as the most frequent copy number changes. In 37 of the analysed tumors a
  MAML2-rearrangement by interphase FISH was detected, whereas 58 of the samples showed
  expression of MECT1-MAML2 fusion transcript. We conclude that the presence of MAML2-rearrangement
  as well as of MECT1-MAML2 fusion transcript may reflect a more favourable prognosis
  and may be a useful marker for clinical prediction of the biological behavior of
  these tumors as previously reported.
