abstract: Alveolar soft part sarcoma ASPS is a rare, histologically distinctive soft
  tissue sarcoma typically occurring in children and young adults. Although the tumor
  often shows focal expression of muscle markers, its relationship with rhabdomyosarcoma
  is not established. The genetic background of ASPS is poorly understood. This study
  was undertaken to analyze the DNA copy number changes in 13 cases of ASPS using
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH on formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
  sections. Four ASPS cases showed DNA copy number changes. Gains were more common
  than losses. Gains observed in more than one case included 1q, 8q, 12q and 16p.
  Although these findings do not show consistent DNA copy number changes in ASPS,
  they give preliminary clues to genomic areas that might be important in the pathogenesis
  of ASPS.
