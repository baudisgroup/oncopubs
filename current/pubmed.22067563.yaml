abstract: The clinicopathological heterogeneity of glioblastoma GBM and the various
  genetic and phenotypic subtypes in GBM stem cells GSCs are well described. However,
  the relationship between GSCs and the corresponding primary tumor from which they
  were isolated is poorly understood. We have established GSC-enriched neurosphere
  cultures from 15 newly diagnosed GBM specimens and examined the relationship between
  the histopathological and genomic features of GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts
  and those of the respective patient tumors. GSC-initiated xenografts recapitulate
  the distinctive cytological hallmarks and diverse histological variants associated
  with the corresponding patient GBM, including giant cell and gemistocytic GBM, and
  primitive neuroectodermal tumor PNET -like components. This indicates that GSCs
  generate tumors that preserve patient-specific disease phenotypes. The majority
  of GSC-derived intracerebral xenografts 11 of 15 demonstrated a highly invasive
  behavior crossing the midline, whereas the remainder formed discrete nodular and
  vascular masses. In some cases, GSC invasiveness correlated with preoperative MRI,
  but not with the status of PI3-kinase Akt pathways or O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase
  expression. Genome-wide screening by array comparative genomic hybridization and
  fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that GSCs harbor unique genetic copy
  number aberrations. GSCs acquiring amplifications of the myc family genes represent
  only a minority of tumor cells within the original patient tumors. Thus, GSCs are
  a genetically distinct subpopulation of neoplastic cells within a GBM. These studies
  highlight the value of GSCs for preclinical modeling of clinically relevant, patient-specific
  GBM and, thus, pave the way for testing novel anti-GSC GBM agents for personalized
  therapy.
