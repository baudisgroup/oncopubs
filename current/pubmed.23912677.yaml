abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC , the most common type of liver cancer, is
  the third primary cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The molecular mechanisms
  underlying the initiation and formation of HCC remain obscure. In the present study,
  we performed exome sequencing using tumor and normal tissues from 3 hepatitis B
  virus HBV -positive BCLC stage A HCC patients. Bioinformatic analysis was performed
  to find candidate protein-altering somatic mutations. Eighty damaging mutations
  were validated and 59 genes were reported to be mutated in HBV-related HCCs for
  the first time here. Further analysis using whole genome sequencing WGS data of
  88 HBV-related HCC patients from the European Genome-phenome Archive database showed
  that mutations in 33 of the 59 genes were also detected in other samples. Variants
  of two newly found genes, ZNF717 and PARP4, were detected in more than 10 of the
  WGS samples. Several other genes, such as FLNA and CNTN2, are also noteworthy. Thus,
  the exome sequencing analysis of three BCLC stage A patients provides new insights
  into the molecular events governing the early steps of HBV-induced HCC tumorigenesis.
