abstract: 'The search for novel oncogenes is important because they could be the target
  of future specific anticancer therapies. In the present paper we report the identification
  of novel amplified genes in lung cancer by means of global gene expression analysis.
  To screen for amplicons, we aligned the gene expression data according to the position
  of transcripts in the human genome and searched for clusters of over-expressed genes.
  We found several clusters with gene over-expression, suggesting an underlying genomic
  amplification. FISH and microarray analysis for DNA copy number in two clusters,
  at chromosomes 11q12 and 13q34, confirmed the presence of amplifications spanning
  about 0.4 and 1 Mb for 11q12 and 13q34, respectively. Amplification at these regions
  each occurred at a frequency of 3 . Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR of each individual
  transcript within the amplicons allowed us to verify the increased in gene expression
  of several genes. The p120ctn and DP1 proteins, encoded by two candidate oncogenes,
  CTNND1 and TFDP1, at 11q12 and 13q amplicons, respectively, showed very strong immunostaining
  in lung tumours with gene amplification. We then focused on the 13q34 amplicon and
  in the TFDP1 candidate oncogene. To further determine the oncogenic properties of
  DP1, we searched for lung cancer cell lines carrying TFDP1 amplification. Depletion
  of TFDP1 expression by small interference RNA in a lung cancer cell line HCC33 with
  TFDP1 amplification and protein over-expression reduced cell viability by 50 . In
  conclusion, we report the identification of two novel amplicons, at 13q34 and 11q12,
  each occurring at a frequency of 3 of non-small cell lung cancers. TFDP1, which
  encodes the E2F-associated transcription factor DP1 is a candidate oncogene at 13q34.
