abstract: 'Genomic instability can be divided into 2 categories: chromosomal instability
  CIN and microsatellite instability MSI . CIN has been linked to aneuploidy and chromosomal
  aberrations, and high-level loss of heterozygosity LOH-H has been suggested to be
  an indicator of CIN. High-level MSI MSI-H , which results from nonfunctional mismatch
  repair, has previously been suggested to be mutually exclusive with CIN. Four MSI-H
  and three LOH-H primary gastric tumors of intestinal histology were used for copy
  number analysis by array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH with 13,000
  cDNA targets. The MSI-H group showed fewer gains 0-12, average 4.5 and losses 0-10,
  average 2.5 per tumor as compared to the LOH-H group 9-15 gains, average 11.6 and
  1-6 losses, average 4 . Two MSI-H tumors did not show any copy number changes and
  one showed only gains of whole chromosomes. The most common alterations were gains
  of 20q 5 7 samples , 1q, 8, and 10p 3 7 samples and losses of 1p and 5p 3 7 samples
  . The minimal amplified regions in 1q and 20q were localized to 1q21.1 approximately
  q21.2, 1q21.3, 20q11.2, 20q13.12, and 20q13.3 approximately qter. No copy number
  change was found to be specific for MSI-H or LOH-H. The results suggest that the
  LOH-H phenotype revealed by microsatellite analysis predicts reliably copy number
  abnormalities on aCGH and that a subset of MSI-H and all LOH-H tumors share the
  CIN phenotype.'
