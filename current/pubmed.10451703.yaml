abstract: We analyzed 23 samples of primary pediatric ependymoma for significant gains
  or losses of genomic DNA, using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and a rigorous
  statistical approach. Nine of the tumors in this series 39 appeared normal by CGH.
  The remainder had a limited number of regions of genomic imbalance, most often involving
  losses of chromosome arms 6q and 22q and the X chromosome, or gains of either 1q
  or 9. Recurrent and exclusive losses of 6q or 22q suggest that these regions harbor
  tumor suppressor genes that may contribute independently to the pathogenesis of
  childhood ependymoma.
