abstract: Prognosis of patients with renal cell carcinoma RCC is mainly determined
  by metastases. The understanding of the metastatic process will give the basis for
  a differential diagnosis leading to an individual prognosis and to new therapeutical
  strategies. In order to define specific genetic alterations which are common in
  renal cancer metastases of the lung, we performed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH on metastases and in some cases on their related primary renal tumors. For CGH,
  DNA was isolated from 2 or 5 paraffin sections 5 micro m . Tumor and normal control
  DNAs were amplified by DOP-PCR and labeled with biotin-dUTP and digoxigenin-dUTP,
  respectively. Hybridization and detection were carried out according to standard
  protocols. In 33 out of 40 metastases, genetic alterations were detected, most frequently
  these were losses of chromosomes 3p 74 , 8p 31 , 9 or 9q 34 , 14 26 , 18q 40 and
  gains of chromosome 5 5q 34 , 7 31 and 12 26 . Combination of loss of 8p and gain
  of 8q occurred frequently. The mean number of aberrations per tumor was 8.1 1-11
  . The comparison of alterations in related primary and metastatic tumors showed
  identical alterations in 5 out of 8 cases. This study demonstrates, that lung metastases
  from renal cell carcinoma are characterized by an accumulation of specific genetic
  alterations which show a clonal relationship to the related primary tumors.
