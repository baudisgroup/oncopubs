abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH has been widely used to detect copy
  number alterations in cancer and to identify regions containing candidate tumor-responsible
  genes however, gene expression changes have been described only in highly amplified
  regions amplicons . To study the overall impact of slight copy number changes on
  gene expression, we analyzed 16 T-cell lymphomas by using CGH and a custom-designed
  cDNA microarray containing 7,657 genes and expressed sequence tags related to tumorigenesis.
  We evaluated mean gene expression and variability within CGH-altered regions and
  explored the relationship between the effects of the gene and its position within
  these regions. Minimally overlapping CGH candidate areas 6q25, 13q21-q22, and 19q13.1
  revealed a weak relationship between altered genomic content and gene expression.
  However, some candidate genes showed modified expression within these regions in
  the majority of tumors these candidate genes were evaluated and confirmed in another
  independent series of 23 T-cell lymphomas by use of the same cDNA microarray and
  by FISH on a tissue microarray. When all the CGH regions detected for each tumor
  were considered, we found a significant increase or decrease in the mean expression
  of the genes contained in gained or lost regions, respectively. In addition, we
  found that the expression of a gene was dependent not only on its position within
  an altered region but also on its own mechanism of regulation: genes in the same
  altered region responded very differently to the gain or loss of genetic material.
