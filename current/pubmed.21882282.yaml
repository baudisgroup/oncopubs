abstract: Anaplasia in Wilms tumor, a distinctive histology characterized by abnormal
  mitoses, is associated with poor patient outcome. While anaplastic tumors frequently
  harbour TP53 mutations, little is otherwise known about their molecular biology.
  We have used array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and cDNA microarray expression
  profiling to compare anaplastic and favorable histology Wilms tumors to determine
  their common and differentiating features. In addition to changes on 17p, consistent
  with TP53 deletion, recurrent anaplasia-specific genomic loss and under-expression
  were noted in several other regions, most strikingly 4q and 14q. Further aberrations,
  including gain of 1q and loss of 16q were common to both histologies. Focal gain
  of MYCN, initially detected by high resolution aCGH profiling in 6 61 anaplastic
  samples, was confirmed in a significant proportion of both tumor types by a genomic
  quantitative PCR survey of over 400 tumors. Overall, these results are consistent
  with a model where anaplasia, rather than forming an entirely distinct molecular
  entity, arises from the general continuum of Wilms tumor by the acquisition of additional
  genomic changes at multiple loci.
