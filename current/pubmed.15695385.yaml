abstract: Genomic imbalances in 31 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded primary tumors
  of advanced breast cancer were analyzed by microarray-based comparative genomic
  hybridization matrix-CGH . A DNA chip was designed comprising 422 mapped genomic
  sequences including 47 proto-oncogenes, 15 tumor suppressor genes, as well as frequently
  imbalanced chromosomal regions. Analysis of the data was challenging due to the
  impaired quality of DNA prepared from paraffin-embedded samples. Nevertheless, using
  a method for the statistical evaluation of the balanced state for each individual
  experiment, we were able to reveal imbalances with high significance, which were
  in good concordance with previous data collected by chromosomal CGH from the same
  patients. Owing to the improved resolution of matrix-CGH, genomic imbalances could
  be narrowed down to the level of individual bacterial artificial chromosome and
  P1-derived artificial chromosome clones. On average 37 gains and 13 losses per tumor
  cell genome were scored. Gains in more than 30 of the cases were found on 1p, 1q,
  6p, 7p, 8q, 9q, 11q, 12q, 17p, 17q, 20q, and 22q, and losses on 6q, 9p, 11q, and
  17p. Of the 51 chromosomal regions found amplified by matrix-CGH, only 12 had been
  identified by chromosomal CGH. Within these 51 amplicons, genome database information
  defined 112 candidate genes, 44 of which were validated by either PCR amplification
  of sequence tag sites or DNA sequence analysis.
