abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technology have allowed us to profile genome-wide
  mutations of various cancer types, revealing huge heterogeneity of cancer genome
  variations. However, its heterogeneous landscape of somatic mutations according
  to liver cancer progression is not fully understood. Here, we profiled the mutations
  and gene expressions of early and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related
  with Hepatitis B-viral infection. Integrative analysis was performed with whole-exome
  sequencing and gene expression profiles of the 12 cases of early and advanced HCCs
  and paired non-tumoral adjacent liver tissues. A total of 293 tumor-specific somatic
  variants and 202 non-tumoral variants were identified. The tumor-specific variants
  were found to be enriched at chromosome 1q particularly in the advanced HCC, compared
  to the non-tumoral variants. Functional enrichment analysis revealed frequent mutations
  at the genes encoding cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, and cell cycle-related
  genes. In addition, to elucidate actionable somatic mutations, we performed an integrative
  analysis of gene mutations and gene expression profiles together. This revealed
  the 48 mutated genes which were differentially mutated with concomitant gene expression
  enrichment. Of these, CTNNB1 was found to have a pivotal role in the differential
  progression of the HCC subgroup. In conclusion, our integrative analysis of whole-exome
  sequencing and transcriptome profiles could provide actionable mutations which might
  play pivotal roles in the heterogeneous progression of HCC.
