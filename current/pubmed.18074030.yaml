abstract: In single-cell human genome analysis using whole-genome amplified product,
  a strong amplification bias involving allele dropout and preferential amplification
  hampers the quality of results. Using an oligonucleotide single nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP array, we systematically examined the nature of this amplification bias, including
  frequency, degree, and preference for genomic location, and we assessed the effects
  of this amplification bias on subsequent genotype and chromosomal copy number analyses.
