abstract: Patients with Down syndrome (DS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
  have distinct clinical and biological features. Whereas most DS-ALL cases lack the
  sentinel cytogenetic lesions that guide risk assignment in childhood ALL, JAK2 mutations
  and CRLF2 overexpression are highly enriched. To further characterize the unique
  biology of DS-ALL, we performed genome-wide profiling of 58 DS-ALL and 68 non-DS
  (NDS) ALL cases by DNA copy number, loss of heterozygosity, gene expression and
  methylation analyses. We report a novel deletion within the 6p22 histone gene cluster
  as significantly more frequent in DS-ALL, occurring in 11 DS (22%) and only 2 NDS
  cases (3.1%) (Fisher's exact P=0.002). Homozygous deletions yielded significantly
  lower histone expression levels, and were associated with higher methylation levels,
  distinct spatial localization of methylated promoters and enrichment of highly methylated
  genes for specific pathways and transcription factor-binding motifs. Gene expression
  profiling demonstrated heterogeneity of DS-ALL cases overall, with supervised analysis
  defining a 45-transcript signature associated with CRLF2 overexpression. Further
  characterization of pathways associated with histone deletions may identify opportunities
  for novel targeted interventions.
