abstract: The expression of the chimeric BCR ABL1 fusion gene resulting from t 9 22
  q34 q11 in chronic myelogenous leukemia CML is necessary for malignant transformation,
  but not sufficient to maintain disease progression. The appearance of various chromosomal
  and molecular alterations in the accelerated and terminal phase of CML is well documented,
  but evidence for causal relationship is largely lacking. We carried out a genome
  wide screening at a resolution of 1 Mb of 54 samples at different stages of CML
  together with 12 CML cell lines and found that disease progression is accompanied
  by a spectrum of recurrent genome imbalances. Among the most frequent are losses
  at 1p36, 5q21, 9p21, and 9q34 and gains at 1q, 8q24, 9q34, 16p, and 22q11, all of
  which were located with higher precision within the genome than previously possible.
  These genome imbalances are unique to CML cases with clinically manifested or suspected
  accelerated blast stage alike, but not seen in chronic phase samples. Previously
  unrecognized cryptic imbalances occurring within the Ph-chromosome were also detected,
  although further scrutiny is required to pin-point gene involvement and seek association
  with disease features. Importantly, some of these imbalances were seen in the CD34
  cells but not in the whole BM samples of patients in accelerated phase. Taken together,
  these findings highlight the potential of screening CD34 cells for genome wide imbalances
  associated with disease progression. Finally, the numerous single copy number variations
  recorded, many unique to this cohort of patients, raise the possible association
  of genome polymorphism and CML.
