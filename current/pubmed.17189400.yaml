abstract: The most well established molecular markers of poor outcome in Wilms tumor
  are loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p and or 16q, although to date no specific
  genes at these loci have been identified. We have previously shown a link between
  genomic gain of chromosome 1q and tumor relapse and sought to further elucidate
  the role of genes on 1q in treatment failure.
