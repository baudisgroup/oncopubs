abstract: HER2-directed therapies, such as trastuzumab and lapatinib, are important
  treatments for breast cancer. However, some tumors do not respond or develop resistance
  to these agents. We isolated and characterized multiple lapatinib-resistant, HER2-positive,
  estrogen receptor ER -positive breast cancer clones derived from lapatinib-sensitive
  BT474 cells by chronic exposure to lapatinib. We show overexpression of AXL as a
  novel mechanism of acquired resistance to HER2-targeted agents in these models.
  GSK1363089 foretinib , a multikinase inhibitor of AXL, MET, and vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor currently in phase II clinical trials, restores lapatinib
  and trastuzumab sensitivity in these resistant cells that exhibit increased AXL
  expression. Furthermore, small interfering RNA to AXL, estrogen deprivation, or
  fulvestrant, an ER antagonist, decreases AXL expression and restores sensitivity
  to lapatinib in these cells. Taken together, these data provide scientific evidence
  to assess the expression of AXL in HER2-positive, ER-positive patients who have
  progressed on either lapatinib or trastuzumab and to test the combination of HER2-targeted
  agents and GSK1363089 in the clinic.
