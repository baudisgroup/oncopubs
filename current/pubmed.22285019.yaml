abstract: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma EHE is a rare vascular tumor whose pathological
  diagnosis can be difficult. In the literature two cases of EHE were found to harbor
  a balanced t 1 3 p36.3 q25 translocation, suggesting a characteristic chromosomal
  rearrangement as cause for the development of EHE. In this study, 14 cases of EHE
  were investigated by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH directed
  against the translocation breakpoint 1p36.3. A subset of cases was also analyzed
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and image cytometry. Five out of eight
  cases that could be successfully analyzed by FISH harbored a chromosomal break in
  the 1p36.3 region. The break-apart signals were present in diploid nuclei, and less
  frequently also in tetraploid nuclei. In the latter, the chromosomal break was present
  twice, suggesting that polyploidy occurred after the chromosomal alteration. DNA
  cytometry confirmed that tetraploid cells were present in most examined cases with
  one case indicating almost equal amounts of diploid and tetraploid tumor cells.
  CGH revealed single chromosomal imbalances of unclear significance. We could confirm
  that EHE may harbor a recurrent mutation involving the 1p36.3 chromosomal region
  thus supporting the notion that the t 1 3 p36.3 q25 translocation is a relevant
  genetic finding in this tumor entity.
