abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis was performed for the identification
  of chromosomal imbalances in two benign gynecomastias and one malignant breast carcinoma
  derived from patients with male breast disease and compared with cytogenetic analysis
  in two of the three cases. CGH analysis demonstrated overrepresentation of 8q in
  all three cases. One case of gynecomastia presented gain of 1p34.3 through pter,
  11p14 through q12, and 17p11.2 through qter, and loss of 1q41 through qter and 4q33
  through qter. The other gynecomastia presented del 1 q41 as detected by both cytogenetic
  and CGH analysis. CGH analysis of the invasive ductal carcinoma confirmed a gain
  of 17p11.2 through qter previously detected by cytogenetic analysis. These regions
  showed some similarity in their pattern of imbalance to the chromosomal alterations
  described in female and male breast cancer.
