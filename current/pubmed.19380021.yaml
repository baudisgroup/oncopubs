abstract: 'To assess the putative correlation between comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH -detectable genetic alterations in epithelial ovarian cancer and disease recurrence,
  conventional CGH was performed on 45 epithelial ovarian cancers: 26 tumors from
  sporadic, BRCA mutation noncarriers and 11 and 8 tumors from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation
  carriers, respectively. Relevant clinical data, including histology, grade, stage,
  size of residual tumor, recurrence, and survival, were obtained from outpatient
  and inpatient charts. Among the 45 cases, the most common regions involving gain
  of DNA copy number were 3q n 23 51 , 8q n 21 47 , and 1q n 14 31 , and the most
  common regions with loss were 19 and 22 at 9 cases 20 each, followed by 5q n 6 13
  . In multivariate analysis, the total number of genetic alterations was not associated
  with risk of recurrence, but gain in 5p was associated with a higher risk of recurrence
  hazard ratio HR 6.06, P 0.0399 , and gain in 1p as well as loss in 5q were associated
  with a significant decrease in recurrence HR 0.08, P 0.0079, and HR 0.10, P 0.0143,
  respectively . Recurrence rate in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer is seemingly
  associated with specific genetic alterations detected by CGH, but the specific genes
  involved and the implications of these findings await further studies.'
