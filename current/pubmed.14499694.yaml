abstract: 'The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes plays a pivotal role
  in tumor development and progression. In this study, we investigated these changes
  using comparative genomic hybridization and bisulfite polymerase chain reaction
  analysis for CpG island hypermethylation of the following genes: TP16, THBS2, E-Cadherin
  ECAD , RARbeta2, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31 in six paired primary breast tumors and
  their matched sentinel lymph nodes SLN . The most frequent chromosomal alterations
  observed were the following: losses of 6q13 approximately q23 and 13q13 approximately
  q32 and gains of 9q31 approximately qter, 11p15 approximately q21, 12q23 approximately
  qter, and 20q12 approximately qter. Gain of 6p21 approximately pter was observed
  in the SLN but in none of the primary tumors. Overall, 71 30 42 of the methylation
  measurements were identical between the primary tumors and the SLN. Of the six cases,
  two showed no differences between the primary tumors and SLN, one tumor with 4 of
  7 genes hypermethylated in the primary tumor showed loss of all four hypermethylation
  events in the SLN, and the remaining three tumors showed loss of one methylation
  event and simultaneous gain of one to two methylation changes in the SLN. This is
  the first study reporting genetic and epigenetic alterations in breast sentinel
  lymph nodes compared to their corresponding primary tumors. Characterization of
  such alterations may lead to identification of initial events associated with the
  metastatic dissemination process.'
