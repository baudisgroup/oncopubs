abstract: Hibernomas are benign tumors with morphological features resembling brown
  fat. They consistently display cytogenetic rearrangements, typically translocations,
  involving chromosome band 11q13. Here we demonstrate that these aberrations are
  associated with concomitant deletions of AIP and MEN1, tumor suppressor genes that
  are located 3 Mb apart and that underlie the hereditary syndromes pituitary adenoma
  predisposition and multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. MEN1 and AIP displayed a
  low expression in hibernomas whereas the expression of genes up-regulated in brown
  fat--PPARA, PPARG, PPARGC1A, and UCP1--was high. Thus, loss of MEN1 and AIP is likely
  to be pathogenetically essential for hibernoma development. Simultaneous loss of
  two tumor suppressor genes has not previously been shown to result from a neoplasia-associated
  translocation. Furthermore, in contrast to the prevailing assumption that benign
  tumors harbor relatively few genetic aberrations, the present analyses demonstrate
  that a considerable number of chromosome breaks are involved in the pathogenesis
  of hibernoma.
