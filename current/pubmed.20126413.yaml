abstract: 'U87MG is a commonly studied grade IV glioma cell line that has been analyzed
  in at least 1,700 publications over four decades. In order to comprehensively characterize
  the genome of this cell line and to serve as a model of broad cancer genome sequencing,
  we have generated greater than 30x genomic sequence coverage using a novel 50-base
  mate paired strategy with a 1.4kb mean insert library. A total of 1,014,984,286
  mate-end and 120,691,623 single-end two-base encoded reads were generated from five
  slides. All data were aligned using a custom designed tool called BFAST, allowing
  optimal color space read alignment and accurate identification of DNA variants.
  The aligned sequence reads and mate-pair information identified 35 interchromosomal
  translocation events, 1,315 structural variations amp gt 100 bp , 191,743 small
  amp lt 21 bp insertions and deletions indels , and 2,384,470 single nucleotide variations
  SNVs . Among these observations, the known homozygous mutation in PTEN was robustly
  identified, and genes involved in cell adhesion were overrepresented in the mutated
  gene list. Data were compared to 219,187 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms
  assayed by Illumina 1M Duo genotyping array to assess accuracy: 93.83 of all SNPs
  were reliably detected at filtering thresholds that yield greater than 99.99 sequence
  accuracy. Protein coding sequences were disrupted predominantly in this cancer cell
  line due to small indels, large deletions, and translocations. In total, 512 genes
  were homozygously mutated, including 154 by SNVs, 178 by small indels, 145 by large
  microdeletions, and 35 by interchromosomal translocations to reveal a highly mutated
  cell line genome. Of the small homozygously mutated variants, 8 SNVs and 99 indels
  were novel events not present in dbSNP. These data demonstrate that routine generation
  of broad cancer genome sequence is possible outside of genome centers. The sequence
  analysis of U87MG provides an unparalleled level of mutational resolution compared
  to any cell line to date.'
