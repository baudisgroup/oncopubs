abstract: 'Low-grade head and neck squamous cell carcinomas without lymph node involvement
  or distant metastasis N 0 M 0 were screened for chromosomal imbalances by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . pT 1-2 tumors contain a low number of aberrations average
  number, 4.3 15 cases , in contrast to pT 3 tumors average number, 11.8 6 cases ,
  and exhibit a specific CGH pattern, affecting three chromosomes: partial or total
  3q gain and or 3p loss 73 of cases , 8q gain 47 , and 11q13 gain 27 . Thus, these
  changes represent early events in the pathogenesis of low-grade tumors. Cytogenetic
  exploration of chromosome 3 aberrations in head and neck cell lines suggests that
  the formation of an isochromosome 3q is one intermediate mechanism leading to 3p
  losses and or 3q gains. On the long arm of chromosome 3, most of tumors exhibit
  low-level gains of large segments, involving systematically the 3q26-qter area,
  but with two alternative smallest region overlaps at 3q26 and 3q28-qter. We decided
  to refine the mapping of 3q26-qter gains by using fluorescence in situ hybridization
  on tumor nuclei, with clones containing two outstanding positional and functional
  candidate genes, PIK3CA and p63, located respectively at 3q26 and at 3q28. Although
  PIK3CA or p63 were preferentially gained in few cases 4 of 45 , both genes were
  over-represented in 27 of 45 low-grade N 0 M 0 carcinomas analyzed by CGH or fluorescence
  in situ hybridization. To evaluate the relative contribution of PIK3CA and p63 in
  the pathogenesis of head and neck carcinomas displaying a 3q gain, we measured their
  respective transcription levels in tumors with previously determined gene copy number.
  DNp63, the predominant p63 transcript, is overexpressed in tumors compared with
  normal tissues, but its expression level is independent to gene copy number. In
  contrast, a significant PIK3CA overexpression is associated with increased gene
  dosage. These results indicate that PIK3CA, contrary to DNp63, may participate to
  the progression of head and neck tumors consequent to a low-level 3q over-representation.
  Interestingly, survival analysis using CGH suggested, in accordance with previous
  data, that 3q26 gain, the locus of PIK3CA, could predict clinical outcome for early
  disease tumors. This prompts us to pursue 3q26 or PIK3CA prognostic evaluation in
  a larger population of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.'
