abstract: Childhood endodermal sinus tumors CEST are a distinct category of germ cell
  tumors that involve the testis and extragonadal sites of young children. Recurrent
  deletions of 1p and 6q have been reported by classic cytogenetic analysis of a small
  number of cases. Comparative genomic hybridization, a technique that screens the
  entire genome for genetic abnormalities, is applied to additionally define the genetic
  changes present in CESTs. Sixteen frozen CESTs 10 testicular, 6 extragonadal obtained
  from Pediatric Oncology Group-affiliated institutions or from the Cooperative Human
  Tissue Network were analyzed. The most common changes were gain of 20q 10 tumors
  , 1q 6 tumors , 11q and 22 4 tumors each , and loss of 6q 8 tumors with common deleted
  region of 6q24-qter , 16q 4 tumors , and 1p 4 tumors . Localized regions of gain
  were identified at 8q24 2 tumors both showing c-myc amplification by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization . Gain of 12p, characteristic of adolescent germ cell tumor,
  was present in one testicular tumor. Comparative genomic hybridization was useful
  in defining genetic differences between adult and childhood tumors, in determining
  the common regions deleted on chromosome 6, and in identifying other involved loci
  to be correlated with clinical parameters in future studies.
