abstract: Recently, expression profiling of breast carcinomas has revealed gene signatures
  that predict clinical outcome, and discerned prognostically relevant breast cancer
  subtypes. Measurement of the degree of genomic instability provides a very similar
  stratification of prognostic groups. We therefore hypothesized that these features
  are linked. We used gene expression profiling of 48 breast cancer specimens that
  profoundly differed in their degree of genomic instability and identified a set
  of 12 genes that defines the 2 groups. The biological and prognostic significance
  of this gene set was established through survival prediction in published datasets
  from patients with breast cancer. Of note, the gene expression signatures that define
  specific prognostic subtypes in other breast cancer datasets, such as luminal A
  and B, basal, normal-like, and ERBB2 , and prognostic signatures including MammaPrint
  and Oncotype DX, predicted genomic instability in our samples. This remarkable congruence
  suggests a biological interdependence of poor-prognosis gene signatures, breast
  cancer subtypes, genomic instability, and clinical outcome.
