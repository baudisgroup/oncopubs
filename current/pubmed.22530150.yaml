abstract: 'To understand cancer progression, it is desirable to study the earliest
  stages of its development, which are often microscopic lesions. Array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH is a valuable high-throughput molecular approach for
  discovering DNA copy number changes however, it requires a relatively large amount
  of DNA, which is difficult to obtain from microdissected lesions. Whole genome amplification
  WGA methods were developed to increase DNA quantity however their reproducibility,
  fidelity, and suitability for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE samples are
  questioned. Using aCGH analysis, we compared two widely used approaches for WGA:
  single cell comparative genomic hybridization protocol SCOMP and degenerate oligonucleotide
  primed PCR DOP-PCR . Cancer cell line and microdissected FFPE breast cancer DNA
  samples were amplified by the two WGA methods and subjected to aCGH. The genomic
  profiles of amplified DNA were compared with those of non-amplified controls by
  four analytic methods and validated by quantitative PCR Q-PCR . We found that SCOMP-amplified
  samples had close similarity to non-amplified controls with concordance rates close
  to those of reference tests, while DOP-amplified samples had a statistically significant
  amount of changes. SCOMP is able to amplify small amounts of DNA extracted from
  FFPE samples and provides quality of aCGH data similar to non-amplified samples.'
