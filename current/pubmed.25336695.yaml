abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate molecular alterations in choroid plexus tumors
  (CPT) using a genome-wide high-throughput approach to identify diagnostic and prognostic
  signatures that will refine tumor stratification and guide therapeutic options.
  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred CPTs were obtained from a multi-institutional tissue
  and clinical database. Copy-number (CN), DNA methylation, and gene expression signatures
  were assessed for 74, 36, and 40 samples, respectively. Molecular subgroups were
  correlated with clinical parameters and outcomes. RESULTS: Unique molecular signatures
  distinguished choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) from choroid plexus papillomas (CPP)
  and atypical choroid plexus papillomas (aCPP); however, no significantly distinct
  molecular alterations between CPPs and aCPPs were observed. Allele-specific CN analysis
  of CPCs revealed two novel subgroups according to DNA content: hypodiploid and hyperdiploid
  CPCs. Hyperdiploid CPCs exhibited recurrent acquired uniparental disomy events.
  Somatic mutations in TP53 were observed in 60% of CPCs. Investigating the number
  of mutated copies of p53 per sample revealed a high-risk group of patients with
  CPC carrying two copies of mutant p53, who exhibited poor 5-year event-free (EFS)
  and overall survival (OS) compared with patients with CPC carrying one copy of mutant
  p53 (OS: 14.3%, 95% confidence interval, 0.71%-46.5% vs. 66.7%, 28.2%-87.8%, respectively,
  P = 0.04; EFS: 0% vs. 44.4%, 13.6%-71.9%, respectively, P = 0.03). CPPs and aCPPs
  exhibited favorable survival. DISCUSSION: Our data demonstrate that differences
  in CN, gene expression, and DNA methylation signatures distinguish CPCs from CPPs
  and aCPPs; however, molecular similarities among the papillomas suggest that these
  two histologic subgroups are indeed a single molecular entity. A greater number
  of copies of mutated TP53 were significantly associated to increased tumor aggressiveness
  and a worse survival outcome in CPCs. Collectively, these findings will facilitate
  stratified approaches to the clinical management of CPTs.'
