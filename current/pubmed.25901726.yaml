abstract: To gain molecular insights of HBV integration that may contribute to HCC
  tumorigenesis, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing and whole genome copy
  number profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from 50 Chinese patients.
  We identified a total of 33 HBV-human integration sites in 16 of 44 HBV-positive
  HCC tissues, which were enriched in HBV genotype C-infected patients. In addition,
  significantly recurrent HBV-MLL4 integration (18%; 8/44) was found in this cohort
  of patients. Using long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing, we comprehensively characterized
  gDNA and cDNA sequences that encode for the HBV-MLL4 transcripts, and we revealed
  that HBV integration into MLL4 exons led to much higher mRNA expression of MLL4
  than the integration into MLL4 introns due to an alternative splicing mechanism.
  Moreover, the HBV-MLL4 integration occurred almost exclusively in CTNNB1 and TP53
  wild-type patients. The integration was also associated with a distinct gene expression
  profile. In conclusion, this is the first report on the molecular basis of the MLL4
  integration driving MLL4 over-expression. HBV-MLL4 integration occurred frequently
  in Chinese HCC patients, representing a unique molecular segment for HCC with HBV
  infection.
