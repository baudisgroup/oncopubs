abstract: Human colorectal cancer CRC is one of the better-understood systems for
  studying the genetics of cancer initiation and progression. To develop a cross-species
  comparison strategy for identifying CRC causative gene or genomic alterations, we
  performed array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to investigate copy number
  abnormalities CNAs , one of the most prominent lesion types reported for human CRCs,
  in 10 spontaneously occurring canine CRCs. The results revealed for the first time
  a strong degree of genetic homology between sporadic canine and human CRCs. First,
  we saw that between 5 and 22 of the canine genome was amplified deleted in these
  tumors, and that, reminiscent of human CRCs, the total altered sequences directly
  correlated to the tumors progression stage, origin, and likely microsatellite instability
  status. Second, when mapping the identified CNAs onto syntenic regions of the human
  genome, we noted that the canine orthologs of genes participating in known human
  CRC pathways were recurrently disrupted, indicating that these pathways might be
  altered in the canine CRCs as well. Last, we observed a significant overlapping
  of CNAs between human and canine tumors, and tumors from the two species were clustered
  according to the tumor subtypes but not the species. Significantly, compared with
  the shared CNAs, we found that species-specific especially human-specific CNAs localize
  to evolutionarily unstable regions that harbor more segmental duplications and interspecies
  genomic rearrangement breakpoints. These findings indicate that CNAs recurrent between
  human and dog CRCs may have a higher probability of being cancer-causative, compared
  with CNAs found in one species only.
