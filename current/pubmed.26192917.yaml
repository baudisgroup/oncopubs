abstract: Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a malignant proliferation of CD56(+)
  and cytoCD3(+) lymphocytes with aggressive clinical course, which is prevalent in
  Asian and South American populations. The molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has largely
  remained elusive. We identified somatic gene mutations in 25 people with NKTCL by
  whole-exome sequencing and confirmed them in an extended validation group of 80
  people by targeted sequencing. Recurrent mutations were most frequently located
  in the RNA helicase gene DDX3X (21/105 subjects, 20.0%), tumor suppressors (TP53
  and MGA), JAK-STAT-pathway molecules (STAT3 and STAT5B) and epigenetic modifiers
  (MLL2, ARID1A, EP300 and ASXL3). As compared to wild-type protein, DDX3X mutants
  exhibited decreased RNA-unwinding activity, loss of suppressive effects on cell-cycle
  progression in NK cells and transcriptional activation of NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways.
  Clinically, patients with DDX3X mutations presented a poor prognosis. Our work thus
  contributes to the understanding of the disease mechanism of NKTCL.
