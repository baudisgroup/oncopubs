abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world,
  with small cell lung cancer SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC comprising
  the two major cell types. Although these cell types can be distinguished readily
  at the histological level, knowledge of their underlying molecular differences is
  very limited. In this study, we compared 14 SCLC cell lines against 27 NSCLC cell
  lines using an integrated array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression
  profiling approach to identify subtype-specific disruptions. Using stringent criteria,
  we have identified 159 of the genes that are responsible for the different biology
  of these cell types. Sorting of these genes by their biological functions revealed
  the differential disruption of key components involved in cell cycle pathways. Our
  novel comparative combined genome and transcriptome analysis not only identified
  differentially altered genes, but also revealed that certain shared pathways are
  preferentially disrupted at different steps in these cell types. Small cell lung
  cancer exhibited increased expression of MRP5, activation of Wnt pathway inhibitors,
  and upregulation of p38 MAPK activating genes, while NSCLC showed downregulation
  of CDKN2A, and upregulation of MAPK9 and EGFR. This information suggests that cell
  cycle upregulation in SCLC and NSCLC occurs through drastically different mechanisms,
  highlighting the need for differential molecular target selection in the treatment
  of these cancers.
