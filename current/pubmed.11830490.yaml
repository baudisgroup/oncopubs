abstract: Hodgkin- and Reed-Sternberg HRS cells microdissected from 41 classical Hodgkin
  lymphomas cHL of 40 patients comprising 8 lymphocyte-rich cHL-LR , 16 nodular sclerosis
  cHL-NS , 15 mixed-cellularity cHL-MC , and 2 lymphocyte-depletion cHL-LD subtypes
  were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization for recurrently imbalanced chromosomal
  subregions. Chromosomal gains most frequently involved chromosome 2p 54 , 12q 37
  , 17p 27 , 9p and 16p 24 each , and 17q and 20q 20 each , whereas losses primarily
  affected chromosome 13q 22 . Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, amplification
  of the REL oncogene was demonstrated within a distinct 2p15-p16 amplicon. The high
  frequency of 2p overrepresentations including REL, particularly in cHL-NS 88 , suggests
  that an alternative mechanism of constitutive activation of nuclear factor NF-kappaB
  is a hallmark of HRS cells. Hierarchical cluster analysis of chromosomal imbalances
  revealed a closer relationship among cHL-NS than other subtypes. Furthermore, there
  is a tendency for different subtypes of cHL-MC tumors characterized by different
  ages at the time of tumor onset and gain of chromosome 17p. The imbalance pattern
  of cHL subtypes suggests that different molecular pathways are activated, with REL
  or other genes on chromosomal band 2p15-p16 playing a fundamental role in the pathogenesis
  of classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
