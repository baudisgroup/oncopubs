abstract: Development of model systems that recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity
  observed among glioblastoma multiforme GBM tumors will expedite the testing of targeted
  molecular therapeutic strategies for GBM treatment. In this study, we profiled DNA
  copy number and mRNA expression in 21 independent GBM tumor lines maintained as
  subcutaneous xenografts GBMX , and compared GBMX molecular signatures to those observed
  in GBM clinical specimens derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA . The predominant
  copy number signature in both tumor groups was defined by chromosome-7 gain chromosome-10
  loss, a poor-prognosis genetic signature. We also observed, at frequencies similar
  to that detected in TCGA GBM tumors, genomic amplification and overexpression of
  known GBM oncogenes, such as EGFR, MDM2, CDK6, and MYCN, and novel genes, including
  NUP107, SLC35E3, MMP1, MMP13, and DDX1. The transcriptional signature of GBMX tumors,
  which was stable over multiple subcutaneous passages, was defined by overexpression
  of genes involved in M phase, DNA replication, and chromosome organization MRC and
  was highly similar to the poor-prognosis mitosis and cell-cycle module MCM in GBM.
  Assessment of gene expression in TCGA-derived GBMs revealed overexpression of MRC
  cancer genes AURKB, BIRC5, CCNB1, CCNB2, CDC2, CDK2, and FOXM1, which form a transcriptional
  network important for G2 M progression and or checkpoint activation. Our study supports
  propagation of GBM tumors as subcutaneous xenografts as a useful approach for sustaining
  key molecular characteristics of patient tumors, and highlights therapeutic opportunities
  conferred by this GBMX tumor panel for testing targeted therapeutic strategies for
  GBM treatment.
