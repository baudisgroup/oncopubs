abstract: The genetic changes underlying the development and progression of male breast
  cancer are poorly understood. Germline BRCA2 mutations account for a significant
  part of male breast cancer, but the majority of patients lack a known inherited
  predisposition. We recently demonstrated that the progression of breast cancer in
  female carriers of a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation follows specific genetic pathways,
  distinct from each other and from sporadic breast cancer. In the present study,
  we performed a genome-wide survey by comparative genomic hybridization CGH of somatic
  genetic aberrations in 26 male breast cancers, including five tumors from BRCA2
  mutation carriers. BRCA2 tumors exhibited a significantly higher number of chromosomal
  aberrations than sporadic tumors. The most common alterations in sporadic male breast
  cancer were 1q 38 , 8q 33 , 17q 33 , -13q 29 , and -8p 24 . In tumors from BRCA2
  mutation carriers, the five most common genetic changes were 8q 100 , 20q 100 ,
  17q 80 , -13q 80 , and -6q 60 . The CGH results in these two groups of male breast
  cancers are almost identical to those identified in the corresponding sporadic and
  BRCA2-associated female breast cancers. The results suggest that despite substantial
  hormonal differences between females and males, similar genetic changes are selected
  for during tumor progression. Furthermore, the presence of a highly penetrant germline
  BRCA2 mutation apparently leads to a characteristic somatic tumor progression pathway,
  again shared between affected male and female mutation carriers.
