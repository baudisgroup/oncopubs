abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Brain metastases are one of the most malignant complications
  of lung cancer and constitute a significant cause of cancer related morbidity and
  mortality worldwide. Recent years of investigation suggested a role of LKB1 in NSCLC
  development and progression, in synergy with KRAS alteration. In this study, we
  systematically analyzed how LKB1 and KRAS alteration, measured by mutation, gene
  expression GE and copy number CN , are associated with brain metastasis in NSCLC.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients treated at University of North Carolina Hospital
  from 1990 to 2009 with NSCLC provided frozen, surgically extracted tumors for analysis.
  GE was measured using Agilent 44,000 custom-designed arrays, CN was assessed by
  Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Sty Array or the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array
  6.0 and gene mutation was detected using ABI sequencing. Integrated analysis was
  conducted to assess the relationship between these genetic markers and brain metastasis.
  A model was proposed for brain metastasis prediction using these genetic measurements.
  RESULTS: 17 of the 174 patients developed brain metastasis. LKB1 wild type tumors
  had significantly higher LKB1 CN p lt 0.001 and GE p 0.002 than the LKB1 mutant
  group. KRAS wild type tumors had significantly lower KRAS GE p lt 0.001 and lower
  CN, although the latter failed to be significant p 0.295 . Lower LKB1 CN p 0.039
  and KRAS mutation p 0.007 were significantly associated with more brain metastasis.
  The predictive model based on nodal N stage, patient age, LKB1 CN and KRAS mutation
  had a good prediction accuracy, with area under the ROC curve of 0.832 p lt 0.001
  . CONCLUSION: LKB1 CN in combination with KRAS mutation predicted brain metastasis
  in NSCLC.'
