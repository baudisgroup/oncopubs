abstract: Acquired aplastic anemia (aAA) is a nonmalignant disease caused by autoimmune
  destruction of early hematopoietic cells. Clonal hematopoiesis is a late complication,
  seen in 20-25% of older patients. We hypothesized that clonal hematopoiesis in aAA
  is a more general phenomenon, which can arise early in disease, even in younger
  patients. To evaluate clonal hematopoiesis in aAA, we used comparative whole exome
  sequencing of paired bone marrow and skin samples in 22 patients. We found somatic
  mutations in 16 patients (72.7%) with a median disease duration of 1ï¿½year; of
  these, 12 (66.7%) were patients with pediatric-onset aAA. Fifty-eight mutations
  in 51 unique genes were found primarily in pathways of immunity and transcriptional
  regulation. Most frequently mutated was PIGA, with seven mutations. Only two mutations
  were in genes recurrently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome. Two patients had
  oligoclonal loss of the HLA alleles, linking immune escape to clone emergence. Two
  patients had activating mutations in key signaling pathways (STAT5B (p.N642H) and
  CAMK2G (p.T306M)). Our results suggest that clonal hematopoiesis in aAA is common,
  with two mechanisms emerging-immune escape and increased proliferation. Our findings
  expand conceptual understanding of this nonneoplastic blood disorder. Future prospective
  studies of clonal hematopoiesis in aAA will be critical for understanding outcomes
  and for designing personalized treatment strategies.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier
