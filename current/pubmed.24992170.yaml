abstract: Detailed genetic profiling of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has
  revealed genomic regions commonly affected by structural changes and a general genetic
  heterogeneity. VHL and PBRM1, both located at chromosome 3p, are 2 major genes mutated
  at high frequency but apart from these aberrations, the mutational landscape in
  ccRCC is largely undefined. Potential prognostic information given by the genomic
  changes appears to depend on the particular cohort studied. We analyzed a Swedish
  ccRCC cohort of 74 patients and found common changes (loss or gain occurring in
  >20% of the tumors) in 12 chromosomal regions (1p, 3p, 3q, 5q, 6q, 7p, 7q 8p, 9p,
  9q, 10q, and 14q). A poor outcome was associated with gain of 7q and losses on 9p,
  9q, and 14q. These aberrations were more frequent in metastasized tumors, suggesting
  alterations of genes important for tumor progression. Sequencing of 48 genes implicated
  in cancer revealed that only VHL, TP53, and PTEN were mutated at a noticeable frequency
  (51%, 9%, and 9%, respectively). Shorter relative telomere length (RTL) has been
  associated with loss of specific chromosomal regions in ccRCC tumors, but we could
  not verify this finding. However, a significantly lower tumor/nontumor (T/N) RTL
  ratio was detected for tumors with losses in 4q or 9p. In conclusion, poor outcome
  in ccRCC was associated with gain of 7q and loss on 9p, 9q, and 14q, whereas the
  mutation rate overall was low in a screen of cancer-associated genes.
