abstract: Tissue samples from 60 post-Chernobyl childhood thyroid tumors have been
  investigated. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to detect chromosomal
  gains and losses within the tumor DNA. This is the first CGH study on childhood
  thyroid tumors. The post-Chernobyl tumors showed chromosomal imbalances in 30 of
  tumors. The most frequent DNA copy number changes in post-Chernobyl tumors involved
  chromosomes 2, 7q11.2-21, 13q21-22, 21 DNA gains , and chromosomes 16p q, 20q, 22q
  DNA losses . Some of these specific alterations detected in post-Chernobyl thyroid
  tumors deletions on chromosomes 16p q and 22q have previously been reported in thyroid
  tumors as associated with an aggressive biologic behavior and may therefore also
  account for the more aggressive phenotype of papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC found
  in post- Chernobyl tumors. Eighteen percent of post-Chernobyl PTC that exhibit RET
  rearrangements also showed chromosomal imbalances indicating that either additional
  genetic events are involved in this subset of tumors, or that intratumoral genetic
  heterogeneity exists in these tumors, suggesting a oligoclonal pattern to tumor
  development.
