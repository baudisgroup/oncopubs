abstract: It is well documented that among subgroups of B-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (B-ALL), the genetic profile of the leukemic blasts has significant impact
  on prognosis and stratification for therapy. Recent studies have documented the
  power of microarrays to screen genome-wide for copy number aberrations (CNAs) and
  regions of copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) that are not detectable
  by G-banding or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These studies have involved
  application of a single array platform for the respective cases. The present investigation
  demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of integrating array results from multiple
  laboratories (ARUP, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children's
  Hospital Medical Center, and University of Minnesota Medical Center) that utilize
  different array platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent, or Illumina) in their respective
  clinical settings. A total of 65 patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group
  (COG) study AALL08B1 were identified for study, as cytogenetic and FISH studies
  had also been performed on these patients, with a central review of those results
  available for comparison. Microarray data were first analyzed by the individual
  laboratories with their respective software systems; raw data files were then centrally
  validated using NEXUS software. The results demonstrated the added value of integrating
  multi-platform data with cytogenetic and FISH data and highlight novel findings
  identified by array including the co-occurrence of low and high risk abnormalities
  not previously reported to coexist within a clone, novel regions of chromosomal
  amplification, clones characterized by numerous whole chromosome LOH that do not
  meet criteria for doubling of a near-haploid, and characterization of array profiles
  associated with an IKZF1 deletion. Each of these findings raises questions that
  are clinically relevant to risk stratification.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015. Published by
