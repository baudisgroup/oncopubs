abstract: Oesophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers and is the sixth
  leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Approximately 70 of global oesophageal
  cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC being
  the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases 90 . Currently, there are
  limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting
  in a 10 five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic
  events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive
  genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium
  research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome
  sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not
  used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes,
  of which six are well known tumour-associated genes TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1,
  NFE2L2 , and two have not previously been described in ESCC ADAM29 and FAM135B .
  Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for
  its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA
  encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene,
  and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of
  ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes
  MLL2 also called KMT2D , ASH1L, MLL3 KMT2C , SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300 are frequently
  altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly
  involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that
  ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms,
  and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored
  novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic
  strategies for ESCC.
