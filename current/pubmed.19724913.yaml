abstract: Five osteosarcoma OS cell lines, 37 OS tumors and 9 corresponding non-neoplastic
  samples were genotyped by Affymetrix 10 K 2.0 SNP array. Regions of high level amplification
  and homozygous deletion were identified and validated by quantitative PCR and FISH.
  Certain recurrent cytogenetic alterations were more frequent in recurrent metastatic
  than in primary OS. These included deletion of 6q14.1, 6q16.2-q22.31, and 8p23.2-p12,
  amplification of 8q21.12, 8q22.3-q24.3 and 17p12, and loss of heterozygosity LOH
  at 2q24.3-q31.2, 5q11.2, 6p21.31-p21.1, 6q14.1-q16.2, 8p22-p12, 9q22.1, 10q21.1-q22.1,
  10q23.31-q24.1, 12q15-q21.1 and 21q21.2-q21.3. Most of the LOH calls were associated
  with deletion, but a subset of them was associated with normal or increased copy
  number CN . A consensus 3q13.31 deletion localized to a region within the limbic
  system-associated membrane protein LSAMP gene was also identified. The FISH evaluations
  demonstrated highly-localized homozygous or heterozygous LSAMP deletions in 6 of
  11 primary OS. qRT-PCR evaluations of the two major alternative LSAMP transcripts
  demonstrated reduced expression of 1b isoform transcript in each of three OS with
  LSAMP exon 1b deletion. Further, the 1a isoform transcripts in these same OS had
  either reduced expression or a premature termination codon in LSAMP exon 2. This
  SNP genotyping study identified chromosomal aberrations associated with disease
  progression in OS and disclosed LSAMP as a novel tumor suppressor gene in OS. The
  study also demonstrated that CN and LOH analyses were able to detect distinct subsets
  of genetic abnormalities in OS.
