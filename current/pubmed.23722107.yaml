abstract: A widely held viewpoint is that the use of multiple markers, combined in
  some type of algorithm, will be necessary to provide high enough discrimination
  between diseased cases and non-diseased. We applied stepwise logistic regression
  analysis to identify the best combination of the 32 biomarkers at chromosome 8q
  on an independent public microarray test set of 80 paired gastric samples. A combination
  of SULF1, INTS8, ATP6V1C1, and GPR172A was identified with a prediction accuracy
  of 98.0 for discriminating carcinomas from adjacent noncancerous tissues in our
  previous 25 paired samples. Interestingly, the overexpression of SULF1 was associated
  with tumor invasion and metastasis. Function prediction analysis revealed that the
  4-marker panel was mainly associated with acidification of intracellular compartments.
  Taken together, we found a 4-gene panel that accurately discriminated gastric carcinomas
  from adjacent noncancerous tissues and these results had potential clinical significance
  in the early diagnosis and targeted treatment of gastric cancer.
