abstract: Complex genomic rearrangements CGRs consisting of two or more breakpoint
  junctions have been observed in genomic disorders. Recently, a chromosome catastrophe
  phenomenon termed chromothripsis, in which numerous genomic rearrangements are apparently
  acquired in one single catastrophic event, was described in multiple cancers. Here,
  we show that constitutionally acquired CGRs share similarities with cancer chromothripsis.
  In the 17 CGR cases investigated, we observed localization and multiple copy number
  changes including deletions, duplications, and or triplications, as well as extensive
  translocations and inversions. Genomic rearrangements involved varied in size and
  complexities in one case, array comparative genomic hybridization revealed 18 copy
  number changes. Breakpoint sequencing identified characteristic features, including
  small templated insertions at breakpoints and microhomology at breakpoint junctions,
  which have been attributed to replicative processes. The resemblance between CGR
  and chromothripsis suggests similar mechanistic underpinnings. Such chromosome catastrophic
  events appear to reflect basic DNA metabolism operative throughout an organisms
  life cycle.
