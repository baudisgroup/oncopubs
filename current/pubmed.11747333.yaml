abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was employed to study chromosomal
  aberrations in relation to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and patient survival in
  94 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma diagnosed between 1983 and 1993. Eighty
  cases had aberrations by CGH. Chromosomal regions 1p21-31.1 10 , 6cen-q24 12 , 8p
  11 , 9p21-ter 14 , 11q21-23.1 11 , 13q13-21.1 12 , and 17p 15 were frequently lost.
  Gains were found at 3q21-ter 22 , 6p 11 , 7p 12 , 8q23-ter 13 , 12cen-q15 17 , 17q24-ter
  13 , and 18q13.3-21 20 . A high number of aberrations amp gt or 4, 33 cases was
  associated P amp lt or 0.001 with the mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  subtypes, a high fraction of tumour cells in S phase, and short survival RR relative
  risk 3.7 . Loss of 1p21-31.1, 8p, 9p21-ter, 11q21-23.1, and 13q13-21.1 were associated
  with mantle cell lymphoma P amp lt or 0.03 , while gain of 6p and 12cen-q15 were
  more frequent in diffuse large B-cell and small lymphocytic lymphoma, respectively
  P 0.04 . Loss of 8p and 17p, and gain of 3q21-ter, 6p, 7p, and 8q23-ter were associated
  with a high S phase fraction P amp lt or 0.03 , but none of the aberrations were
  associated with tumour apoptotic fraction P amp gt or 0.13 . The most important
  prognostic CGH parameters P amp lt 0.001 were losses of 11q21-23.1 RR 3.8 and 17p
  RR 4.4 , and gain of 6p RR 4.2 . The latter parameters and IPI were the only ones
  with independent prognostic value RR 10, 5.0, 6.7, and 3.7, respectively P amp lt
  0.001 when assessed together with lymphoma sub-type, primary versus relapse cases,
  treatment, B symptoms, S phase fraction, and presence of BCL1 and BCL2 translocations.
  A combined CGH IPI binary parameter had high prognostic value for patients receiving
  different treatments, with various lymphoma sub-types, and for primary as well as
  relapse cases.
