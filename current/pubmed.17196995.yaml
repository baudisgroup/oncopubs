abstract: In order to identify small regions of the genome whose specific copy number
  alteration is associated with high genomic instability in the form of overall genome-wide
  copy number aberrations, we have analyzed array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH data from 33 sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Copy number changes of a small
  number of specific regions were significantly correlated with elevated overall amplifications
  and deletions scattered throughout the entire genome. One significant region at
  9q34 includes the c-ABL gene. Another region spanning 22q11-q13 includes the breakpoint
  cluster region BCR of the Philadelphia chromosome. Coordinate 22q11-q13 alterations
  were observed in 9 of 11 tumors with the 9q34 alteration. Additional regions on
  1q and 14q were associated with overall genome-wide copy number changes, while copy
  number aberrations on chromosome 7p, 7q, and 13q21.1-q31.3 were found associated
  with this instability only in tumors from patients with a smoking history. Our analysis
  demonstrates there are a small number of regions of the genome where gain or loss
  is commonly associated with a tumors overall level of copy number aberrations. Our
  finding BCR and ABL located within two of the instability-associated regions, and
  the involvement of these two regions occurring coordinately, suggests a system akin
  to the BCR-ABL translocation of CML may be involved in genomic instability in about
  one-third of human colorectal carcinomas.
