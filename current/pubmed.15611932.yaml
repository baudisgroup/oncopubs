abstract: Gastric cancer GC frequently displays changes in DNA copy number, but few
  studies have precisely correlated specific genetic alterations with changes in gene
  expression. We undertook both array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and expression
  analyses of 20 primary GCs using a cDNA microarray with more than 9,300 genes. Diverse
  clinical and histopathologic tumor subtypes, including signet-ring tumors and tumors
  at the gastroesophageal junction, were analyzed. All tumors showed changes in gene
  copy number, with the majority showing multiple changes. Regions of gain and loss
  were generally consistent with previous cytogenetic reports however, the use of
  aCGH greatly increased the resolution of measured genomic change. By comparing gene
  expression and high-resolution measurement of gene copy number directly, we were
  able to identify several regions of high-level gain associated with substantially
  increased gene expression that have not been defined previously in GC. Novel candidate
  oncogenes included dual-specificity tyrosine- Y -phosphorylation-regulated kinase
  2 DYRK2 and protein tyrosine kinase 7 PTK7 .
