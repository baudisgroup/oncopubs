abstract: 'Genome-wide copy number profiles were characterized in 41 primary bladder
  tumors using array-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH . In addition
  to previously identified alterations in large chromosomal regions, alterations were
  identified in many small genomic regions, some with high-level amplifications or
  homozygous deletions. High-level amplifications were detected for 192 genomic clones,
  most frequently at 6p22.3 E2F3 , 8p12 FGFR1 , 8q22.2 CMYC , 11q13 CCND1, EMS1, INT2
  , and 19q13.1 CCNE . Homozygous deletions were detected in 51 genomic clones, with
  four showing deletions in more than one case: two clones mapping to 9p21.3 CDKN2A
  p16, in nine cases , one at 8p23.1 three cases , and one at 11p13 two cases . Significant
  correlations were observed between copy number gain of clones containing CCNE1 and
  gain of ERBB2, and between gain of CCND1 and deletion of TP53. In addition, there
  was a significant complementary association between gain of CCND1 and gain of E2F3.
  Although there was no significant relationship between copy number changes and tumor
  stage or grade, the linked behavior among genomic loci suggests that array CGH will
  be increasingly important in understanding pathways critical to bladder tumor biology.'
