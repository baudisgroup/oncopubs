abstract: Pheochromocytomas and abdominal paragangliomas are rare, catecholamine-producing
  tumors that arise from the chromaffin cells derived from the neural crest. We used
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH to screen for copy number changes in 23 pheochromocytomas
  and 11 abdominal paragangliomas. The pattern of copy number changes was similar
  between pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, with the most consistent finding being
  loss of 1cen-p31, which was detected in 28 34 tumors 82 . Losses were also found
  on 3q22-25 41 , 11p 26 , 3p13-14 24 , 4q 21 , 2q 15 , and 11q22-23 15 , and gains
  were detected on 19p 26 , 19q 24 , 17q24-qter 21 , 11cen-q13 15 , and 16p 15 . Losses
  of 1p and 3q were detected in the majority of tumors, whereas gains of 19p and q,
  17q, and 16p were seen only in tumors with six or more CGH alterations. This progression
  of genetic events did not correspond with the conversion to a malignant phenotype.
  CGH alterations involving chromosome 11 were more frequent in the malignant tumors,
  compared with the benign tumors 9 12 versus 3 16 . In summary, we propose that pheochromocytomas
  and abdominal paragangliomas, which share many clinical features, also have a common
  genetic origin and that the loss of 1cen-p31 represents an early and important event
  in tumor development.
