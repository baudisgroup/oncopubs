abstract: Mycosis fungoides MF and S zary syndrome SS are primary cutaneous T-cell
  lymphomas CTCL , a heterogeneous group of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the
  three cases of MF and four of SS studied, comparative genomic hybridization detected
  chromosomal imbalances in all SS cases and in one MF case. In all five abnormal
  cases, the long arm of chromosome 17 was completely or partially duplicated in three
  of these five cases, it was the sole genomic event. Notably, a minimal common duplicated
  region at 17q11.2 approximately q12, corresponded to the mapping of HER2 neu and
  STAT family genes. The only recurrent loss involved chromosome 10, with deletion
  of the entire long arm in one case and deletion of band 10q23 in another. Sporadic
  imbalances included gains at chromosome arms 1q, 2q, 7p, 7q, and 12p. Genomic duplication
  at 17q11.2 approximately q12 emerged as a primary karyotypic abnormality common
  to both MF and SS, which suggests that this is an early clonal event.
