abstract: Despite the recent success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs in the treatment
  of chronic myeloid leukemia CML , approximately 2-17 of patients develop clonal
  cytogenetic changes in the Philadelphia-negative Ph - cell population. A fraction
  of these patients, in particular those displaying trisomy 8 or monosomy 7, are at
  risk of developing a myelodysplastic syndrome MDS or acute myeloid leukemia AML
  . Consequently, there is a need to characterize the clinical features of such cases
  and to increase our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the
  emergence of clonal cytogenetic changes in Ph - cells. To date, most cases reported
  have received treatment with imatinib. Here we describe the case of a patient with
  CML who developed monosomy 7 in Ph - cells during dasatinib therapy. At 20 months
  after dasatinib initiation, the patient developed MDS, which rapidly progressed
  into AML. Genome-wide 500K SNP array analysis of the monosomy 7 clone revealed no
  acquired submicroscopic copy number changes. Given the strong association between
  monosomy 7 and mutation of genes involved in the RAS pathway in juvenile myelomonocytic
  leukemia, we also screened for pathogenetic variants in KRAS, NRAS, and PTPN11,
  but did not detect any changes.
