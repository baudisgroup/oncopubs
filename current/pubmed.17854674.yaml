abstract: Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy in many tropical and subtropical
  areas, correlating well with the endemicity of schistostomiasis. The majority of
  schistostomiasis-associated SA bladder cancers are squamous cell cancers, whereas
  the majority of non-SA cases in the Western world are transitional cell cancers,
  suggesting different carcinogenetic mechanisms. Approximately 6 of SA and 1 of non-SA
  cases are adenocarcinomas. To achieve fine-resolution information of DNA copy number
  changes in SA adenocarcinomas, 10 tumor samples were analyzed on an oligonucleotide-based
  CGH array. The frequency of aberrations ranged from 2 to 17, with an average of
  10 alterations per sample. The most frequently gained regions were 20q and 8q in
  70 and 60 of the cases, respectively , whereas the most frequently lost regions
  were 5q and 8p both in 40 of the cases . In addition, six regions of amplification
  were found in three samples, containing both well characterized and novel regions.
  Comparison of the DNA copy number profiles to previously reported profiles of SA
  transitional cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma revealed similarities e.g.,
  gains at 5p and 8q , as well as differences e.g., TCC- and SCC-associated losses
  at 18p and 20p, and adenocarcinoma-associated gains at 20q . The results suggest
  that although SA cancers share genetic features, there also exist histology-specific
  regions of gain and loss.
