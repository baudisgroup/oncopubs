abstract: Estimation of the survival of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma
  (SCC) on the basis of histopathology is inadequate. The aim of this study was to
  identify genomic regions with potential value for estimating the prognosis of these
  patients.  Depending on their survival time, 100 patients with primary lung SCC
  were separated into high- or low-risk prognostic groups, and their copy number aberrations
  (CNAs) were analyzed using array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH).  We
  identified 123 CNA regions that were significantly associated with survival. Among
  these regions, some have been reported previously (eg, amplifications of 8p12, 3q27.1,
  and loss of 9p21.3 and 13q34) but others have never been reported. For example,
  gains of 3q27.1, 5p13.2, and 5p13.3 were found to be associated with a favorable
  prognosis, but patients harboring gains of 11q23.3, 11q13.1, and 14q32.3, and deletions
  of 3p21.3 and 9p21.3 tended to have poor survival. Among the 123 CNA regions, 41
  were further selected to construct a survival estimation model that could effectively
  separate SCC patients into high- or low-risk groups with an accuracy of 92%, sensitivity
  of 90%, and specificity of 94%. The results of the array-CGH were further validated
  in an independent cohort of 45 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens using
  real-time polymerase chain reaction.  A number of CNA regions were found to be associated
  with the survival of SCC patients, and we were able to construct a model to estimate
  prognosis on the basis of these regions. Assessment of these CNAs could potentially
  assist in clinical decision-making regarding adjuvant therapy after surgery.  Copyright
