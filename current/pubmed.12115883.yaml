abstract: It is established that subtypes of human malignant mesotheliomas MM are
  associated with different survival times. Ninety cases of MM were examined using
  DNA cytometry and comparative genomic hybridization CGH , with emphasis on the main
  histological subtypes epithelioid, sarcomatoid and biphasic. A comparison by DNA
  cytometry revealed moderate differences, with the rare subgroup of mesodermomas
  having the highest and the sarcomatoid group the lowest rate of aneuploidy. Using
  CGH, 6.2 chromosomal imbalances per case on average could be detected. Losses 4.1
  case were more common than gains of chromosomal material 2.1 case . MM show no single,
  specific defect, but a typical pattern of genomic defects can be attributed to this
  tumour entity. Common losses are clustered at the chromosomal regions 9p21 34 ,
  22q 32 , 4q31-32 29 , 4p12-13 25 , 14q12-24 23 , 1p21 21 , 13q13-14 19 , 3p21, 6q22,
  10p13-pter and 17p12-pter 16 each . Common gains are located on 8q22-23 18 , 1q23
  1q32 16 , 7p14-15 and 15q22-25 14 each . While differences in the frequencies of
  the defects between epithelioid and sarcomatoid MM are not as pronounced as are
  seen with the pleomorphic mesodermomas, several chromosomal locations 3p, 7q, 15q,
  17p show significant variations. The most pronounced distinguishing feature of sarcomatoid
  MM is a more than fourfold higher number of amplicons. These data indicate that
  MM has a distinctive tumour biology with a broad spectrum of heterogeneity, as reflected
  in morphology and also, more subtly, in the patterns of chromosomal imbalances of
  the subtypes.
