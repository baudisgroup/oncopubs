abstract: Metastases in distant organs are the major cause of death for cancer patients,
  and bone marrow is a prominent homing organ for early disseminated cancer cells.
  However, it remains still unclear which of these cells evolve into overt metastases.
  We therefore established a new approach based on the analysis of viable and proliferating
  cancer cells by single-cell comparative genomic hybridization.
