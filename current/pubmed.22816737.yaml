abstract: Using high-resolution genomic microarray analysis, a distinct genomic profile
  was defined in 114 samples from patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma SMZL
  . Deletion or uniparental disomy of chromosome 7q were detected in 42 of 114 37
  SMZLs but in only nine of 170 5 mature B-cell lymphomas P lt 0.00001 . The presence
  of unmutated IGHV, genomic complexity, 17p13-TP53 deletion and 8q-MYC gain, but
  not 7q deletion, correlated with shorter overall survival of SMZL patients. Mapping
  studies narrowed down a commonly deleted region of 2.7 Mb in 7q32.1-q32.2 spanning
  a region between the SND1 and COPG2 genes. High-throughput sequencing analysis of
  the 7q32-deleted segment did not identify biallelic deletions insertions or clear
  pathogenic gene mutations, but detected six nucleotide changes in IRF5 n 2 , TMEM209
  n 2 , CALU n 1 and ZC3HC1 n 1 not found in healthy individuals. Comparative expression
  analysis found a fourfold down-regulation of IRF5 gene in lymphomas with 7q32 deletion
  versus non-deleted tumours P 0.032 . Ectopic expression of IRF5 in marginal-zone
  lymphoma cells decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro, and impaired
  lymphoma development in vivo. These results show that cryptic deletions, insertions
  and or point mutations inactivating genes within 7q32 are not common in SMZL, and
  suggest that IRF5 may be a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in this lymphoma
  entity.
