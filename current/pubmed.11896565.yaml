abstract: 'Malignant tumors have telomerase activity, which is thought to play a critical
  role in tumor growth. However, the relation between telomerase activity and genomic
  DNA status in tumor cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined
  telomerase activity in 13 clear cell type renal cell carcinomas CRCCs with similar
  clinicopathologic features by telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay TRAP
  . Based on TRAP assay results, we divided the CRCCs into two groups: a high telomerase
  activity group and a low no telomerase activity group. We then analyzed genomic
  aberration, DNA ploidy, and telomere status in these two groups by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH , laser scanning cytometry LSC , and telomere-specific fluorescence
  in situ hybridization T-FISH , respectively. CGH showed the high telomerase activity
  group to have fewer genomic changes than the low no telomerase activity group, which
  had many genomic aberrations. Moreover, with LSC, DNA diploid cells were found more
  frequently in the high telomerase activity group than in the low no telomerase activity
  group. In addition, T-FISH revealed strong telomere signal intensity in the high
  telomerase activity group compared with that of the low no telomerase activity group.
  These results suggest that telomerase activity is linked to genomic DNA status and
  that high telomerase activity is associated with genomic stability, DNA ploidy,
  and telomere length in CRCC.'
