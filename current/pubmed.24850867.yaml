abstract: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) includes a group of diseases characterized
  by dysplasia of bone marrow myeloid lineages with ineffective hematopoiesis and
  frequent evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whole-genome sequencing was
  performed in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from eight cases
  of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), the high-risk subtype of MDS. The
  nucleotide substitution patterns were found similar to those reported in AML, and
  mutations of 96 protein-coding genes were identified. Clonal architecture analysis
  revealed the presence of subclones in six of eight cases, whereas mutation detection
  of CD34(+) versus CD34(-) cells revealed heterogeneity of HSPC expansion status.
  With 39 marker genes belonging to eight functional categories, mutations were analyzed
  in 196 MDS cases including mostly RAEB (n = 89) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage
  dysplasia (RCMD) (n = 95). At least one gene mutation was detected in 91.0% of RAEB,
  contrary to that in RCMD (55.8%), suggesting a higher mutational burden in the former
  group. Gene abnormality patterns differed between MDS and AML, with mutations of
  activated signaling molecules and NPM1 being rare, whereas those of spliceosome
  more common, in MDS. Finally, gene mutation profiles also bore prognostic value
  in terms of overall survival and progression free survival.
