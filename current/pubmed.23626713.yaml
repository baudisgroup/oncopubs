abstract: The motor protein kinesin superfamily proteins KIFs are involved in cancer
  progression. The depletion of one of the KIFs, KIF14, might delay the metaphase-to-anaphase
  transition, resulting in a binucleated status, which enhances tumor progression
  however, the exact correlation between KIF14 and cancer progression remains ambiguous.
  In this study, using loss of heterozygosity and array comparative genomic hybridization
  analyses, we observed a 30 loss in the regions surrounding KIF14 on chromosome 1q
  in lung adenocarcinomas. In addition, the protein expression levels of KIF14 in
  122 lung adenocarcinomas also indicated that approximately 30 of adenocarcinomas
  showed KIF14 down-regulation compared with the expression in the bronchial epithelial
  cells of adjacent normal counterparts. In addition, the reduced expression of KIF14
  mRNA or proteins was correlated with poor overall survival P  0.0158 and amp lt
  0.0001, respectively , and the protein levels were also inversely correlated with
  metastasis P amp lt 0.0001 . The overexpression of KIF14 in lung adenocarcinoma
  cells inhibited anchorage-independent growth in vitro and xenograft tumor growth
  in vivo. The overexpression and silencing of KIF14 also inhibited or enhanced cancer
  cell migration, invasion and adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins laminin
  and collagen IV. Furthermore, we detected the adhesion molecules cadherin 11 CDH11
  and melanoma cell adhesion molecule MCAM as cargo on KIF14. The overexpression and
  silencing of KIF14 enhanced or reduced the recruitment of CDH11 in the membrane
  fraction, suggesting that KIF14 might act through recruiting adhesion molecules
  to the cell membrane and modulating cell adhesive, migratory and invasive properties.
  Thus, KIF14 might inhibit tumor growth and cancer metastasis in lung adenocarcinomas.
