abstract: Osteosarcoma OS is the common histological form of primary bone cancer and
  one of the leading aggressive cancers in children under age fifteen. Although several
  genetic predisposing conditions have been associated with OS the understanding of
  its molecular etiology is limited. Here, we show that microRNAs miRNAs at the chr.14q32
  locus are significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma compared to normal bone tissues.
  Bioinformatic predictions identified that a subset of 14q32 miRNAs miR-382, miR-369-3p,
  miR-544 and miR-134 could potentially target cMYC transcript. The physical interaction
  between these 14q32 miRNAs and cMYC was validated using reporter assays. Further,
  restoring expression of these four 14q32 miRNAs decreased cMYC levels and induced
  apoptosis in Saos2 cells. We also show that exogenous expression of 14q32 miRNAs
  in Saos2 cells significantly downregulated miR-17-92, a transcriptional target of
  cMYC. The pro-apoptotic effect of 14q32 miRNAs in Saos2 cells was rescued either
  by overexpression of cMYC cDNA without the 3UTR or with miR-17-92 cluster. Further,
  array comparative genomic hybridization studies showed no DNA copy number changes
  at 14q32 locus in OS patient samples suggesting that downregulation of 14q32 miRNAs
  are not due to deletion at this locus. Together, our data support a model where
  the deregulation of a network involving 14q32 miRNAs, cMYC and miR-17-92 miRNAs
  could contribute to osteosarcoma pathogenesis.
