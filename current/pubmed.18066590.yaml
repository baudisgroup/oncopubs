abstract: 'We attempted to investigate the clinicopathological correlation of renal
  oncocytoma RO with renal vein extension. We identified seven ROs with extension
  into the branches of renal vein. The age of seven patients ranged from 61 to 82
  years. Five cases were identified incidentally two patients had gross hematuria.
  After surgery, all patients were alive and free of tumors with follow-up of 1 to
  5 years mean 3.6 . Oncocytomas measured from 2.2 to 7.5 cm. Renal vein extension
  was grossly suspected in five of seven cases and histologically confirmed in all
  seven cases. Tumor cells were positive for cytokeratins, mitochondrial-antigen MIA
  , epithelial membrane antigen EMA , and parvalbumin five of seven tumors were focally
  positive for CD117. Ultrastructurally, the cytoplasm was packed by mitochondria.
  Molecular genetic analysis did not detect abnormal numbers of chromosomes 1, 2,
  6, 7, 10, 17, and XY by fluorescence in situ hybridization, loss of heterozygosity
  on 3p and mutation of von Hippel-Lindau gene in all cases. Array comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis of two cases did not show any major genetic changes. Our
  conclusions are as follows: 1 renal oncocytomas may have intravascular extension
  to the branches of the renal vein 2 renal oncocytomas with intravascular extension
  to the branches of the renal vein have the same morphological, immunohistochemical,
  and cytogenetic findings as have their counterparts without evidence of intravascular
  invasion 3 the absence of metastases suggests an overall benign behavior of this
  tumor, but this has to be substantiated by further studies with a long-term follow-up
  and 4 in a renal tumor with granular cytoplasm showing renal vein extension, it
  is necessary to carefully exclude renal cell carcinomas such as chromophobe RCC,
  oncocytic variant of papillary RCC, and granular variant of clear cell RCC.'
