abstract: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative
  disorder characterised by 7q32 deletion, but the target genes of this deletion remain
  unknown. In order to elucidate the genetic target of this deletion, we performed
  an integrative analysis of the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and miRNomic
  data. High resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of 56 cases of SMZL
  delineated a minimally deleted region (2.8 Mb) at 7q32, but showed no evidence of
  any cryptic homozygous deletion or recurrent breakpoint in this region. Integrated
  transcriptomic analysis confirmed significant under-expression of a number of genes
  in this region in cases of SMZL with deletion, several of which showed hypermethylation.
  In addition, a cluster of 8 miRNA in this region showed under-expression in cases
  with the deletion, and three (miR-182/96/183) were also significantly under-expressed
  (P<0.05) in SMZL relative to other lymphomas. Genomic sequencing of these miRNA
  and IRF5, a strong candidate gene, did not show any evidence of somatic mutation
  in SMZL. These observations provide valuable guidance for further characterisation
  of 7q deletion.
