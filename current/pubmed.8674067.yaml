abstract: 'A newly developed method of comparative genomic hybridization CGH employing
  quantitative statistical comparisons was applied to DNA from two different types
  of advanced prostate cancer tissue. Multiple CGH analyses were obtained for each
  chromosome in each tumor, and the results of point-by-point comparison of the mean
  tumor:normal color ratio to a control normal:normal color ratio in each of 1247
  evenly distributed data channels constituting the entire human genome were interpreted
  as loss, gain, or no change in copy number in the tumor genome. Group I tissue was
  obtained from prostate cancer metastases from 20 patients, 19 of whom had received
  no prior prostate cancer treatment. This DNA also was analyzed by Southern and microsatellite
  allelotyping at 53 different loci on 20 different chromosome arms. CGH results agreed
  with allelotyping results at 92 of the informative loci studied. These samples,
  which contained highly enriched tumor DNA, showed the highest rates of alteration
  yet reported in several chromosomal regions known to be altered frequently in prostate
  cancer: 8q gain 85 , 8p loss 80 , 13q loss 75 , 16q loss 55 , 17p loss 50 , and
  10q loss 50 . Group II tissue was obtained predominately from primary or recurrent
  tumor from 11 patients who had been treated with long-term androgen-deprivation
  therapy and developed androgen-independent metastatic disease. Quantitative CGH
  analysis on DNA from these tissues showed chromosomal alterations that were very
  similar to those found in group I, suggesting that untreated metastatic tumors contain
  the bulk of chromosomal alterations necessary for recurrence to occur during androgen
  deprivation. In the entire data set, a number of previously undetected regions of
  frequent loss or gain were identified, including losses of chromosomes 2q 42 , 5q
  39 , 6q 39 , and 15q 39 and gains of chromosomes 11p 52 , 1q 52 , 3q 52 , and 2p
  45 . Chi-squared analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of gain of the
  4q25-q28 region in tumors from African-American patients, indicating a possible
  oncogene whose activation may play a role in the higher rate of progression seen
  in this ethnic group. Additional study of these frequently altered regions may provide
  insight into the mechanism of prostate cancer progression and lead to important
  tools for tumor-specific prognosis and therapy.'
