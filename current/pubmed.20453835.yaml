abstract: Breast adenosquamous carcinomas are rare tumours characterized by well-developed
  gland formation intimately admixed with solid nests of squamous cells immersed in
  a highly cellular spindle cell stroma. A low-grade variant has been described that
  is associated with a better prognosis. Here we studied five cases of adenosquamous
  carcinomas to determine their genetic profiles and to investigate whether the spindle
  cell component of these cancers could at least in part stem from the glandular epithelial
  components. Five adenosquamous carcinomas of the breast were subjected to 1 immunohistochemical
  analysis, 2 microdissection and genetic analysis with a high-resolution microarray
  comparative genomic hybridization platform, and 3 chromogenic in situ hybridization.
  All cases displayed a triple-negative immunophenotype, consistently expressed basal
  keratins and showed variable levels of epidermal growth factor receptor expression.
  Microarray comparative genomic hybridization analysis of two of the cases revealed
  multiple low-level gains and losses affecting several chromosomal arms. Case 1 displayed
  gains of the whole of chromosome 7, and case 2 harboured a focal, high-level amplification
  of 7p12, encompassing the epidermal growth factor receptor gene, which was associated
  with strong and intense membranous epidermal growth factor receptor expression.
  Chromogenic in situ hybridization revealed that the genetic features found in the
  epithelial cells were also present in a minority of the spindle cells of the stromal
  component, in particular in those near the epithelial clusters, indicating that
  some of the spindle cells are clonal and derived from the epithelial component of
  the tumour. In conclusion, breast adenosquamous carcinomas are triple-negative cancers
  that express basal keratins. These tumours harbour complex genetic profiles. Some
  of the spindle cells in adenosquamous carcinomas are derived from the epithelial
  component, suggesting that adenosquamous carcinomas may also be part of the group
  of metaplastic breast carcinomas with spindle cell metaplastic elements.
