abstract: Compromised quality of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE -derived DNA
  has compounded the use of archival specimens for array-based genomic studies. Recent
  technological advances have led to first successes in this field however, there
  is currently no general agreement on the most suitable platform for the array-based
  analysis of FFPE DNA. In this study, FFPE and matched fresh-frozen FF specimens
  were separately analyzed with Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism SNP 6.0
  and Agilent 4x44K oligonucleotide arrays to compare the genomic profiles from the
  two tissue sources and to assess the relative performance of the two platforms on
  FFPE material. Genomic DNA was extracted from matched FFPE-FF pairs of normal intestinal
  epithelium from four patients and were applied to the SNP and oligonucleotide platforms
  according to the manufacturer-recommended protocols. On the Affymetrix platform,
  a substantial increase in apparent copy number alterations was observed in all FFPE
  tissues relative to their matched FF counterparts. In contrast, FFPE and matched
  FF genomic profiles obtained via the Agilent platform were very similar. Both the
  SNP and the oligonucleotide platform performed comparably on FF material. This study
  demonstrates that Agilent oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization
  generates reliable results from FFPE extracted DNA, whereas the Affymetrix SNP-based
  array seems less suitable for the analysis of FFPE material.
