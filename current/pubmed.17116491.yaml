abstract: 'Primary effusion lymphomas PEL form a subset of AIDS-related lymphomas
  and usually have a poor prognosis. Although Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpes virus
  KSHV is often associated with PEL, very little is known about the exact mechanisms
  or causative effects of these associations. We investigated the chromosomal imbalances
  in six KSHV-positive PEL cell lines using comparative genomic hybridization analysis.
  We defined the shortest regions of overlaps for genomic gains on six chromosomes:
  1q31, 4q31 approximately q33, 7q10 approximately q21, 8q21.1, 12q0 approximately
  q23, and Xp11 approximately q21. The recurrent nature of the gains found in these
  chromosomal regions suggests that these imbalances play roles in the pathogenesis
  of PEL.'
