abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy.
  Here, we performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 125 HCC tumors and whole-exome
  sequencing on 24 of these tumors. We identified 135 homozygous deletions and 994
  somatic mutations of genes with predicted functional consequences. We found new
  recurrent alterations in four genes (ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2) not previously
  described in HCC. Functional analyses showed tumor suppressor properties for IRF2,
  whose inactivation, exclusively found in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related tumors,
  led to impaired TP53 function. In contrast, inactivation of chromatin remodelers
  was frequent and predominant in alcohol-related tumors. Moreover, association of
  mutations in specific genes (RPS6KA3-AXIN1 and NFE2L2-CTNNB1) suggested that Wnt/Î²-catenin
  signaling might cooperate in liver carcinogenesis with both oxidative stress metabolism
  and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study provides insight
  into the somatic mutational landscape in HCC and identifies interactions between
  mutations in oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations related to specific risk
  factors.
