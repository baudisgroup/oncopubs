abstract: Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are peculiar epithelial tumors of the anterior
  mediastinum. They may show aggressive clinical behavior and are a paradigm for the
  interaction between the tumor and the immune system. So far, adequate functional
  studies enabling a better understanding of this malignancy have not been performed,
  since human thymoma thymic carcinoma cell lines have not been available. Here, the
  authors describe the establishment, characterization and functional analyses of
  epithelial cell lines from a Type B1-thymoma and a poorly differentiated thymic
  carcinoma. By Fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS analyses, both cell lines
  were aneuploid. The aneuploid cell fraction of the thymic carcinoma cell line was
  characterized by a high proliferation index of 55.9 , in contrast to a lower proliferation
  rate of the aneuploid cell fraction of the thymoma 19.7 . Array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH and conventional cytogenetic analysis of the thymoma
  revealed only minor imbalances whereas the thymic carcinoma was characterized by
  a complex karyotype in the hyperdiploid range that was readily defined with multicolor
  FISH mFISH . Application of a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduced cell viability in
  both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these first cell lines
  of a thymoma and a CD5-positive thymic carcinoma are useful tools for further in
  vitro studies of cellular, molecular and genetic aspects of the disease and for
  functional tests to evaluate new therapeutic targets.
