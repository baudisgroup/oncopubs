abstract: Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease displaying complex genomic alterations,
  and consequently, it has been difficult to determine the most relevant copy number
  alterations with the scale of studies to date. We obtained genome-wide copy number
  alteration CNA data from four different SNP array platforms, with a final data set
  of 398 ovarian tumours, mostly of the serous histological subtype. Frequent CNA
  aberrations targeted many thousands of genes. However, high-level amplicons and
  homozygous deletions enabled filtering of this list to the most relevant. The large
  data set enabled refinement of minimal regions and identification of rare amplicons
  such as at 1p34 and 20q11. We performed a novel co-occurrence analysis to assess
  cooperation and exclusivity of CNAs and analysed their relationship to patient outcome.
  Positive associations were identified between gains on 19 and 20q, gain of 20q and
  loss of X, and between several regions of loss, particularly 17q. We found weak
  correlations of CNA at genomic loci such as 19q12 with clinical outcome. We also
  assessed genomic instability measures and found a correlation of the number of higher
  amplitude gains with poorer overall survival. By assembling the largest collection
  of ovarian copy number data to date, we have been able to identify the most frequent
  aberrations and their interactions.
