abstract: Dysregulation of cell cycle control, especially G1 S phase transition, is
  implicated in the pathogenesis of most human cancers, including esophageal squamous
  cell carcinoma ESCC . However, the clinicopathological significance of aberrant
  expression of G1 S phase-related proteins in ESCC remains unclear. In the present
  study, cyclin D1, p21WAF1 Cip1 and p53 protein expression were examined in 148 ESCC
  cases using immunohistochemistry combined with tissue microarray. We then analyzed
  the correlations between their expression and clinicopathological parameters and
  found that overexpression of p53 was associated with lymph node metastasis P 0.001
  . p21WAF1 Cip1 down-regulation was an independent prognostic factor by multivariate
  analysis RR 0.418, P amp lt 0.001 . Further more, array-CGH results revealed that
  cyclin D1 gene was amplified in 45.4 of ESCC patients. This study confirms that
  dysregulation of G1 S related genes is common in ESCC and reduced expression of
  p21WAF1 Cip1 protein can predict shorter overall survival time of patients with
  ESCC.
