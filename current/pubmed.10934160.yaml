abstract: In this study we have characterized chromosomal imbalances in a panel of
  29 parathyroid carcinomas using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The most
  frequently detected imbalances were losses of 1p and 13q that were seen in amp gt
  40 of the cases. The commonly occurring regions of loss were assigned to 1p21-p22
  41 , 13q14-q31 41 , 9p21-pter 28 , 6q22-q24 24 , and 4q24 21 , whereas gains preferentially
  involved 19p 45 , Xc-q13 28 , 9q33-qter 24 , 1q31-q32 21 and 16p 21 . The distribution
  of CGH alterations supports the idea of a progression of genetic events in the development
  of parathyroid carcinoma, where gains of Xq and 1q would represent relatively early
  events that are followed by loss of 13q, 9p, and 1p, and by gain of 19p. A sex-dependent
  distribution was also evident for two of the common alterations with preferential
  gain of 1q in female cases and of Xq in male cases. When the CGH profiles for the
  29 carcinomas were compared with our previously published results for sporadic parathyroid
  adenomas, highly significant differences were revealed. Loss of 1p, 4q, and 13q
  as well as gains of 1q, 9q, 16p, 19p and Xq were significantly more common in the
  carcinomas than in the adenomas. In contrast, loss of the 11q13 region, which is
  the most common CGH abnormality in sporadic adenomas, was not detected in any of
  the carcinomas. Taken together, the findings identify several candidate locations
  for tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that are potentially involved in parathyroid
  carcinogenesis.
