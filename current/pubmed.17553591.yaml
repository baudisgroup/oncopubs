abstract: Chromosomal aberrations of malignant cells from pleural effusions of 31
  cases of lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed. Pooled CGH results showed frequent amplifications
  on chromosome arms 1p 22.6 , 1q 35.5 , 2q 25.8 , 3q 38.7 , 4q 41.9 , 5p 41.9 , 5q
  51.6 , 6p 19.4 , 6q 25.8 , 7p 41.9 , 7q 35.5 , 8q 32.3 , 12q 38.7 , 13q 22.6 , 14q
  35.5 , 17q 19.4 , Xp 22.6 , and Xq 38.7 . Frequent deletions were found on 1p 19.4
  , 3p 16.1 , 4q 16.1 , 8p 25.8 , 9p 22.6 , 9q 29.0 , 10q 22.6 , 13q 22.6 , 16p 19.4
  , 16q 22.6 , 17p 29.0 , 18q 16.1 , 19p 41.9 , 19q 32.3 , 20p 19.4 and 22q 29 . These
  genomic changes were generally found consistent with previous reports of CGH analysis
  of primary tumors of lung adenocarcinoma. Loss of 19q and 22q were more frequently
  found in our studies 32.3 and 29.0 , respectively than studies of primary tumors
  less than 7 for both genetic changes . Gain of 11p, although not a frequent finding,
  was relatively more common in this 16 than other studies range, 2.9-11.8 . Interestingly,
  occurrences of 3p loss and 11p gain were higher in smokers than non-smokers, and
  deletion of 3p and increased copy number of 11p and Xp appeared more often in male
  than female patients. Among 17 male patients, gain of chromosomal 11p was a frequent
  aberration in tumors of smokers, while gain of Xp was more easily found in tumors
  of non-smokers. One candidate gene located within 11p15, lactate dehydrogenase C
  LDHC , was selected for further study. Three cases with 11p gain had amplified FISH
  signals of LDHC. Also tumors from smokers or male had significantly higher transcript
  level of LDHC than non-smokers or female, respectively. The results demonstrate
  that different cytogenetic changes of malignant pleural effusions from lung adenocarcinoma
  are correlated with genders and smoking habits. The role of LDHC in the carcinogenesis
  of smoking-related lung adenocarcinoma, especially in male patients with pleural
  effusions, deserves further investigations.
