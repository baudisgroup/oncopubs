abstract: 'Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSC) of the kidney is a distinct
  entity characterized by bland tightly packed elongated tubules and spindle cells
  with low nucleolar grade in a basophilic mucinous stroma. Several case studies have
  reported MTSC with high grade features and have brought into question whether they
  represented MTSC or a variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma.We searched our
  pathology database and identified seven cases: six MTSC with high International
  Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) nucleolar grade, and one MTSC with overall
  low nucleolar grade but extensive necrosis. DNA samples were extracted from paraffin
  blocks and analyzed using a SNP array platform.Six out of seven patients were female,
  with ages between 46 to 82 years. Tumour sizes range from 3 to 7.5 cm. One case
  showed involvement of renal sinus fat and a second case showed involvement of the
  perinephric fat. All cases shared common chromosomal abnormalities observed with
  the more typical MTSC, with monosomy of chromosomes 1,4,6,8,9,13,14,15 and 22. Trisomy
  of chromosomes 7, 17 and loss of Y chromosome were not observed in any of the cases.
  None of the patients showed evidence of recurrence or metastasis.The molecular analysis
  performed in this study support that MTSC of the kidney can have high nucleolar
  grade or extensive necrosis, and that they are not papillary renal cell carcinoma.
  We support modifying the definition of MTSC to include those with higher nucleolar
  grade. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'
