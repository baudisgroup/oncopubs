abstract: The majority of genetic studies of colorectal carcinogenesis have focused
  on changes found in primary tumors. Despite the fact that liver metastases are a
  leading cause of colorectal cancer deaths, the molecular genetic basis of the advanced
  disease stages remains poorly understood. We performed comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH on 17 liver metastases from colorectal carcinomas and compared the quantitative
  profile with the qualitative profile previously obtained with chromosome banding.
  An average of 12.6 aberrations per tumor was found by CGH. Chromosome 18 and chromosome
  arms 4q, 8p, and 17p were most frequently lost, whereas chromosomes 7 and 20 and
  chromosome arms 6p, 8q, and 13q were most frequently gained. We compared the chromosome
  banding and CGH data after converting the karyotypes into net copy number gains
  and losses. Ten tumors showed agreement between the findings of the two techniques,
  whereas five tumors did not in two cases, no mitotic cells were obtained for banding
  analysis . All five discordant cases had a amp quot simple amp quot abnormal or
  normal karyotype, but revealed multiple changes by CGH. A likely explanation for
  this discrepancy is that in vitro growth before G-banding selected against the cancer
  cells. Interestingly, by comparing the CGH profiles of the amp quot complex amp
  quot vs. the amp quot simple amp quot normal karyotype groups, deletion of 8p and
  gain of 16q were seen more frequently in the former group. The liver metastases
  had the same aberrations as seen in primary colorectal carcinomas, summarized in
  a literature survey. However, these aberrations were seen more frequently in liver
  metastases, which may be attributable to increased genetic instability.
