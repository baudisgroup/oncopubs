abstract: To identify genetic events underlying the genesis and progression of multiple
  myeloma MM , we conducted a high-resolution analysis of recurrent copy number alterations
  CNAs and expression profiles in a collection of MM cell lines and outcome-annotated
  clinical specimens. Attesting to the molecular heterogeneity of MM, unsupervised
  classification using nonnegative matrix factorization NMF designed for array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH analysis uncovered distinct genomic subtypes. Additionally,
  we defined 87 discrete minimal common regions MCRs within recurrent and highly focal
  CNAs. Further integration with expression data generated a refined list of MM gene
  candidates residing within these MCRs, thereby providing a genomic framework for
  dissection of disease pathogenesis, improved clinical management, and initiation
  of targeted drug discovery for specific MM patients.
