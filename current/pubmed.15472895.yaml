abstract: Loss of heterozygosity and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH studies
  have shown that deletions of 1p and 19q are highly prevalent in oligodendroglioma.
  However, these tumors have not been comprehensively screened for other alterations
  in chromosomal dosage. In this study, we used array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  CGHa of mapped BAC DNA to screen for such alterations in 31 oligodendrogliomas 20
  grade II, 9 grade III, and 2 grade IV and 4 mixed oligoastrocytomas 1 grade I, 1
  grade II, and 2 grade IV . The most frequent aberrations were loss of 1p 17 cases
  49 and 19q 15 cases 43 and combined loss of 1p 19q 13 cases 37 . In addition, deletion
  of 4q, 5p, 9p, 10q, 11p, and 13q was observed in 10, 4, 8, 4, 4, and 13 cases, respectively
  loss of whole chromosomes 4, 9, and 13 in 4, 1, and 7 cases, respectively gain of
  7p, 8q, 10p, and 11q in 6, 6, 5, and 10 cases, respectively, and gain of whole chromosomes
  7 and 11 in 2 patients each. Minimally altered regions detected by CGHa involved
  chromosome bands 1p36.32, 4q33, 5p15, 8q24, 11p15, and 19q13.3. Univariate analysis
  of all 35 cases suggested that combined deletion of 1p and 19q is associated with
  better survival P 0.03 . In addition, 8q gain in the oligodendrogliomas was strongly
  associated with poor outcome P 0.002 . Also associated with poor disease outcome
  were alterations that had low prevalence in the pure oligodendrogliomas, including
  loss of 3q, 9q, and 12q and gain of 1p, 8p, and 10q. In summary, in oligodendrogliomas,
  CGHa was able to detect novel small alterations in chromosomal dosage that had not
  been previously detected by other methods. In addition, our findings support the
  hypotheses that oligodendroglioma can be classified into several groups by CGHa
  analysis and that specific alterations in genetic dosage may have biologic or clinical
  significance.
