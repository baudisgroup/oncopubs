abstract: Next-generation sequencing is making sequence-based molecular pathology
  and personalized oncology viable. We selected an individual initially diagnosed
  with conventional but aggressive prostate adenocarcinoma and sequenced the genome
  and transcriptome from primary and metastatic tissues collected prior to hormone
  therapy. The histology-pathology and copy number profiles were remarkably homogeneous,
  yet it was possible to propose the quadrant of the prostate tumour that likely seeded
  the metastatic diaspora. Despite a homogeneous cell type, our transcriptome analysis
  revealed signatures of both luminal and neuroendocrine cell types. Remarkably, the
  repertoire of expressed but apparently private gene fusions, including C15orf21:MYC,
  recapitulated this biology. We hypothesize that the amplification and over-expression
  of the stem cell gene MSI2 may have contributed to the stable hybrid cellular identity.
  This hybrid luminal-neuroendocrine tumour appears to represent a novel and highly
  aggressive case of prostate cancer with unique biological features and, conceivably,
  a propensity for rapid progression to castrate-resistance. Overall, this work highlights
  the importance of integrated analyses of genome, exome and transcriptome sequences
  for basic tumour biology, sequence-based molecular pathology and personalized oncology.  Copyright
