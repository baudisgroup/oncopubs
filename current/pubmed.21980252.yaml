abstract: Most patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia all are reported to have acquired
  chromosomal abnormalities in their leukemic bone marrow cells. Many established
  chromosome rearrangements have been described, and their associations with specific
  clinical, biologic, and prognostic features are well defined. However, approximately
  30 of pediatric and 50 of adult patients with all do not have cytogenetic abnormalities
  of clinical significance. Despite significant improvements in outcome for pediatric
  all, therapy fails in approximately 25 of patients, and these failures often occur
  unpredictably in patients with a favorable prognosis and amp quot good amp quot
  cytogenetics at diagnosis.It is well known that karyotype analysis in hematologic
  malignancies, although genome-wide, is limited because of altered cell kinetics
  mitotic rate , a propensity of leukemic blasts to undergo apoptosis in culture,
  overgrowth by normal cells, and chromosomes of poor quality in the abnormal clone.
  Array comparative genomic hybridization acgh- amp quot microarray amp quot has a
  greatly increased genomic resolution over classical cytogenetics. Cytogenetic microarray,
  which uses genomic dna, is a powerful tool in the analysis of unbalanced chromosome
  rearrangements, such as copy number gains and losses, and it is the method of choice
  when the mitotic index is low and the quality of metaphases is suboptimal. The copy
  number profile obtained by microarray is often called a amp quot molecular karyotype.
  amp quot In the present study, microarray was applied to 9 retrospective cases of
  pediatric all either with initial high-risk features or with at least 1 relapse.
  The conventional karyotype was compared to the amp quot molecular karyotype amp
  quot to assess abnormalities as interpreted by classical cytogenetics. Not only
  were previously undetected chromosome losses and gains identified by microarray,
  but several karyotypes interpreted by classical cytogenetics were shown to be discordant
  with the microarray results. The complementary use of microarray and conventional
  cytogenetics would allow for more sensitive, comprehensive, and accurate analysis
  of the underlying genetic profile, with concomitant improvement in prognosis and
  treatment, not only for pediatric all, but for neoplastic disorders in general.
