abstract: Analyses of cancer incidence data in the United States and Western Europe
  revealed steadily rising rates over the past decades of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus
  and gastric cardia. Genetic information on gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and its
  preneoplasias is sparse. We have used comparative genomic hybridization to obtain
  a genome-wide overview of 20 archival gastric cardia adenocarcinomas and 10 adjacent
  preneoplastic lesions 4 metaplasias, 1 low-grade dysplasia, 5 high-grade dysplasias
  . Multiple genetic alterations were discriminated in all adenocarcinomas. Frequent
  loss amp gt or 25 of all tumors was detected, in decreasing order of frequency,
  on 5q, 18q, 4q, 3p, 9p, 2q, 11q, 14q, 21q, 4p, 9q, 16q, 1p, and 8p. Frequent gain
  amp gt or 25 of all tumors was disclosed, in decreasing order of frequency, on 20q,
  7p, 8q, 1q, 7q, 20p, 17q, 13q, Xp, 6q, 8p, 19q, 5p, 6p, and Xq. Loss of the Y chromosome
  was found in 60 of male cases. High level amplification was frequently amp gt 10
  of all tumors detected on 7q21, 8p22, 12p11.2, 17q12-q21, and 19q13.1-q13.2. The
  precursor lesions showed multiple aberrations in all high-grade dysplasias, whereas
  few genetic changes were discerned in LGD and metaplasias. High level amplifications
  were also found in high-grade dysplasias, ie, on 7q21, 8p22, and 17q12-q21. Moreover,
  the percentage of aberrations was not significantly different for invasive carcinomas
  or high-grade dysplasias. Approximately 70 of the precursor aberrations were also
  present in the adjacent carcinoma. Minimal overlapping regions in the preneoplasias
  included loss on 18q12-q21 and gains on 8q23 and 17q12-q21, suggesting involvement
  of genes residing in these regions. In conclusion, we have i created a map of genetic
  alterations in gastric cardia adenocarcinomas and ii provided evidence for the presence
  of a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in this poorly understood type of cancer.
