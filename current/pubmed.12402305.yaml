abstract: Osteosarcomas are the most frequent bone sarcomas. The molecular chromosomal
  aberrations in osteosarcomas were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . We studied 47 frozen tumors 41 primary samples, 6 relapses in osteosarcoma
  patients registered in the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study COSS protocol. Genomic
  imbalances were detected in 40 of 41 primary tumors and 6 of 6 relapsed tumors.
  Gains were more frequent than losses ratio of 1.3:1 . The median number of changes
  was 16 and 12 in primary and relapsed osteosarcomas, respectively. The median number
  of aberrations in primary high-grade osteosarcomas 17.0 was significantly higher
  than in low- or intermediate-grade osteosarcoma subtypes 3.0 p 0.038 . The most
  frequent gains included 8q, 1p21-p31 and 1q21-q24, and the most frequent losses
  were 10q, 5q and 13q. High-level gains were observed on 8q23-q24, 17p13 and 1q21-q24.
  A gain of 19p p amp lt 0.001 or loss of 9p p 0.027 was more frequent in poor responders
  than in good responders. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with primary
  metastases p 0.002 , poor histologic responses p 0.005 , high-level gains of 19p
  p 0.012 or losses of 13q14 p 0.042 had significantly lower event-free survival EFS
  , whereas patients with a loss of 5q p 0.007 or a loss of 10q21-22 p 0.017 had significantly
  higher EFS than patients without these aberrations. Multivariate analysis demonstrated
  that primary metastasis, loss of 13q14 and loss of 5q were independent prognostic
  factors. The findings of our study seem to be useful for evaluating the prognosis
  of patients and may finally lead to treatment strategies based on genetic background
  of osteosarcoma.
