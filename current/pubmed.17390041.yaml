abstract: The histological subclassification of gliomas is increasingly assisted by
  the underlying molecular genetics which has major importance in guiding clinical
  management of the disease. However, the assessment of several molecular events for
  improving clinical care remains a challenge. Herein, we report on comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and immunohistochemical IHC assessment of EGFR, PTEN, p53, and
  MIB-1 expression in 13 oligodendrogliomas 10 WHO grade II, 3 WHO grade III , one
  oligoastrocytoma WHO grade III and 23 high-grade astrocytomas 3 WHO grade III, 20
  glioblastoma multiforme . The most frequent imbalances in oligodendroglial tumors
  including the oligoastrocytic case were, in decreasing order of frequency, 7q, -1p,
  and -4q and in astrocytomas 7q, -10q, 7p, -9p, -10p, 20q, and 20p. Some individual
  imbalances were associated with increasing numbers of chromosomal changes, that
  were 7q in both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, and -9p, -10q, 20p, and 20q
  in astrocytomas. The markers p53 and MIB-1 were significantly higher expressed in
  astrocytomas than in oligodendrogliomas and expression levels of p53 and EGFR were
  inversely associated within the astrocytic group. In addition, p53 overexpression
  correlated positively with 7q and negatively with -1p in the oligodendroglial group
  whereas EGFR overexpression correlated positively with -1p in the oligodendroglial
  and positively with 7p and -10p in the astrocytic group. Short overall survival
  was significantly associated with 7p and -10q in astrocytomas. Collectively, these
  results contribute to the increasing clinical relevance of assessing tumor biological
  markers in gliomas.
