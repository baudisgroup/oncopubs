abstract: Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to be a unifying
  molecular feature in pilocytic astrocytoma PA . Genetically, tandem duplications
  at chromosome 7q34 resulting in KIAA1549-BRAF fusion genes constitute the most common
  mechanism identified to date. To elucidate alternative mechanisms of aberrant MAPK
  activation in PA, we screened 125 primary tumors for RAF fusion genes and mutations
  in KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, PTPN11, BRAF and RAF1. Using microarray-based comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH , we identified in three cases an interstitial deletion of 2.5
  Mb as a novel recurrent mechanism forming BRAF gene fusions with FAM131B, a currently
  uncharacterized gene on chromosome 7q34. This deletion removes the BRAF N-terminal
  inhibitory domains, giving a constitutively active BRAF kinase. Functional characterization
  of the novel FAM131B-BRAF fusion demonstrated constitutive MEK phosphorylation potential
  and transforming activity in vitro. In addition, our study confirmed previously
  reported BRAF and RAF1 fusion variants in 72 90 125 of PA. Mutations in BRAF 8 125
  , KRAS 2 125 and NF1 4 125 and the rare RAF1 gene fusions 2 125 were mutually exclusive
  with BRAF rearrangements, with the exception of two cases in our series that concomitantly
  harbored more than one hit in the MAPK pathway. In summary, our findings further
  underline the fundamental role of RAF kinase fusion products as a tumor-specific
  marker and an ideally suited drug target for PA.
