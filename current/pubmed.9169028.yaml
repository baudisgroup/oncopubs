abstract: Classical cytogenetic analysis plays an important role in the diagnosis
  and classification of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . However, poor
  in vitro growth of the malignant cells and suboptimal quality of metaphase spreads
  may sometimes cause false-negative findings normal karyotype . We used comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH to study whether this new method is able to detect and
  characterize genetic aberrations not detected by karyotyping. CGH showed clonal
  genetic aberrations in 8 of 13 cases, most of which showed gains of several chromosomes,
  indicating hyperdiploidy. The sensitivity of CGH was sufficient to detect a small
  interstitial deletion of 6q. One karyotypically complex case was resolved by CGH
  showing a high-level amplification of DNA sequences originating from the 12p12-13.
  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analyses confirmed the CGH findings
  in 2 cases, validating the accuracy of CGH. In conclusion, CGH experiments established
  the known fact that hyperdiploidy is the most common finding in pediatric ALLs and
  that CGH may detect aberrations that are not seen in the G-banded karyotype. CGH
  was also able to further characterize genetic aberrations such as gene amplification,
  which is occasionally involved in pediatric ALL as well as in other leukemias.
