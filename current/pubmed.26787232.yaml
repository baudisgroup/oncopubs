abstract: 'whole genome sequencing studies have recently shown that osteosarcomas
  display high rates of structural variation i.e. they contain many somatic mutations
  and copy number alterations. TP53 and RB1 show recurrent somatic alterations in
  concordant studies, suggesting that they could be key players in bone oncogenesis.  we
  carried out whole genome sequencing of DNA from 7 high-grade osteosarcoma samples
  matched with normal tissue from the same patients.  we confirmed the presence of
  genetic alterations of the TP53 (including novel unreported mutations) and RB1 genes.
  Most interestingly, we identified a total of 84 point mutations and 4 deletions
  related to 82 different genes in osteosarcoma samples, of which only 15 have been
  previously reported. Interestingly, the number of mutated genes (ranging from 4
  to 8) was lower in TP53mut cases compared with TP53wt cases (ranging from 14 to
  45). This was also true for the mutated RB1 case. We also observed that a dedifferentiated
  osteosarcoma harbouring MDM2 amplification did not carry any other mutations.  This
  study suggests that bone oncogenesis driven by TP53 or RB1 mutations occurs on a
  background of relative genetic stability and that the dedifferentiated osteosarcoma
  subtype represents a clinico-pathological entity with distinct oncogenic mechanisms
  and thus requires different therapeutic management.  ï¿½ The Author 2016. Published
