abstract: Oncocytic cells are characterized by a greatly increased number of mitochondria
  that distend the cell cytoplasm and result in a distinctive granular appearance
  of the cell on conventional histology sections. Oncocytes are frequently found in
  metabolically active human tissues including the thyroid gland, and, as a general
  rule, when their proportion in a thyroid tumor is greater than 75 the tumor is referred
  to as oncocytic H rthle cell adenoma or carcinoma. Such tumors represent a subset
  of thyroid lesions, and recently, both interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH and comparative genomic hybridization CGH studies reported that they may show
  aneuploidy, with widespread numerical chromosomal alterations. In contrast, very
  few cases have been studied by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Whether the cells
  with chromosomal changes are the same as those with mitochondrial accumulation or
  whether lesions only partially composed of oncocytic cells also have cytogenetic
  alterations is unclear. To investigate the relationship between acquisition of the
  oncocytic phenotype and numerical chromosomal changes, we analyzed a random selection
  of thyroid lesions with 18 cases and without 11 cases morphological evidence of
  oncocytic differentiation. Lesions with oncocytes included hyperplastic nodules,
  adenomas, H rthle cell tumors, and papillary carcinomas with lymphocytic stroma
  Whartin-like tumors of the thyroid . Karyotypic changes were analyzed by cytogenetic
  analysis, FISH, or CGH, and the results were compared with in situ analysis of mitochondrial
  accumulation by immunofluorescence. A striking correlation between the presence
  of oncocytes and the presence of aneuploid katyotypes was seen in the oncocytic
  follicular thyroid nodules, but not in the oncocytic papillary tumors. Structural
  chromosome changes or normal karyotypes were observed in the lesions lacking oncocytic
  features. Extending the FICTION technique to the evaluation of a cytoplasmic antigen
  mitochondrial membrane antigen , we pursued the simultaneous visualization of both
  mitochondrial increase and numerical chromosomal alterations, and showed that oncocytes
  of follicular lesions are prone to become aneuploid. Our data support the contention
  that follicular tumors composed of oncocytes should be regarded as a distinct subset.
