abstract: The management of Wilms tumors consists of a combination of surgery, chemotherapy,
  and possibly radiotherapy. To date, chemotherapy is being risk stratified according
  to histologic subtype and stage. Although the cytogenetic characteristics of Wilms
  tumors are well established, the cytogenetic effects related to chemotherapy are
  widely unknown. We herein report on comparative genomic hybridization findings in
  41 primary Wilms tumors of blastemal type, of which 19 had received preoperative
  chemotherapy PCT group and 22 did not non-PCT group . Overall, imbalances could
  be detected in 32 tumors, with 1q 17 cases , 7q 10 cases , 7p 6 cases , and -7p
  6 cases as the most common changes. Among these, 7q and -7p were both significantly
  associated with metastatic disease at the time of surgery P 0.002 and 0.007, respectively
  , and 7q was also associated with higher stage stages III IV P 0.003 . There were
  significant differences in the cytogenetic constitution of tumors between the two
  treatment groups. As a trend, tumors in the preoperative-chemotherapy group had
  fewer changes mean, 2.7 than those in the non-preoperative-chemotherapy group mean,
  3.8 , and the frequencies of imbalances at 7p or 7q, respectively, were significantly
  lower compared with tumors in the non-preoperative-chemotherapy group 2 of 19 versus
  10 of 22, P 0.019 1 of 19 versus 9 of 22, P 0.011 . In contrast, -1q was common
  in both the preop-CT group 10 of 19 and the non-preop-CT group 7 of 22 . The results
  suggest that Wilms tumor clones with 1q are not obliterated by preoperative chemotherapy,
  whereas cytogenetically more complex clones with 7q and or imbalances at 7p seem
  more responsive and are more likely to be eliminated by chemotherapeutic treatment.
