abstract: Human carcinoma in situ of the breast already demonstrates genomic changes
  found in invasive lesions. However, no specific genetic alterations have previously
  been identified that are associated with progression from the in situ to the invasive
  stage. By comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH analysis of an invasive breast carcinoma with a large associated in situ component,
  high-level amplification of C-MYC was found in the invasive component only. To determine
  the frequency of this correlation in a panel of 188 invasive breast carcinomas,
  18 additional cases with C-MYC amplification were identified. Nine of these cases
  had a detectable adjacent in situ component. FISH analysis demonstrated increased
  amp gt 5 C-MYC signals per nucleus in seven invasive components and increased amp
  gt 4 C-MYC centromere 8 signal ratios in five of these. None of the associated in
  situ components demonstrated these increases. The minimal amplified region was defined
  at 8q24.13-8qter. C-MYC amplification was correlated with overexpression of C-MYC
  and two of its target genes, TERT and FBL. Thus, C-MYC amplification is the first
  identified genetic alteration that is associated with progression from the in situ
  to the invasive stage of breast carcinoma.
