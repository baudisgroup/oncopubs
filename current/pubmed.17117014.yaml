abstract: 'The pathologic heterogeneity of AIDS related lymphomas ARL reflects several
  pathogenic mechanisms: chronic antigenic stimulation, Epstein-Barr virus EBV infection,
  and genomic abnormalities. Genetic abnormalities, known to play a major role in
  lymphomas of non-immunocompromised patients, are not well characterized in ARL.'
