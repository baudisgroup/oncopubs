abstract: By identifying cancer driver genes involved in tumorigenesis, whole-exome
  sequencing (WES) analyses enable the development of robust biomarkers and novel
  therapeutic targets to reach precision oncology.WES analyses were performed in matched
  gastric cancer-normal gastric tissues from two patients. We compared genes highlighted
  with those of a database and recent WES/whole-genome sequencing studies.We identified
  32 highlighted gastric cancer genes, two of these (DEFB118 and RNF43) may provide
  future potential clinical implications.Definitive evidence on extensive genetic
  heterogeneity suggests the need for large-scale next-generation sequencing studies
  to validate gastric cancer driver genes catalog. This list represents the foundation
  for developing genome-based biomarkers to guide precision gastric cancer treatment.
