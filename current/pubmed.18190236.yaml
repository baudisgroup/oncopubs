abstract: 'The efficient detection of chromosomal aberrations in childhood acute leukaemias
  presents a significant component in the diagnostics of this frequent malignant disease.
  We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH and high-resolution comparative genomic
  hybridization HR-CGH to determine the frequency of chromosomal changes in 33 children
  with acute leukaemia AL . The yields of chromosomal abnormalities were compared
  with the results obtained using conventional cytogenetics G-banding and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH . Conventional cytogenetics revealed chromosomal changes
  in 17 52 of studied patients. The employment of FISH together with G-banding analysis
  identified chromosomal changes in 27 82 of the AL patients investigated. CGH detected
  changes in DNA copy numbers in 24 73 patients, 40 losses and 67 gains were found
  in total. HR-CGH disclosed 98 losses and 97 gains in 26 79 patients. In comparison
  with CGH, HR-CGH analyses unveiled 88 new chromosomal aberrations: 58 losses and
  30 gains. The most commonly gained chromosomes were 21 22.5 , X 15 , 18 12,5 and
  17 10 . The most common losses involved sub-regions or arms of chromosomes 7 15
  , 9 12.5 , 16, 19 and 1 10 each . Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analyses
  of 33 childhood acute leukaemias revealed chromosomal changes in total 31 94 patients.
  The evaluation of HR-CGH sensitivity proved that the minimal cell population of
  malignant cells in which a certain chromosomal change could be found was close to
  the 20 - 30 level. Our results confirm the benefits of HR-CGH in detecting chromosomal
  changes in childhood AL. Supplementing G-banding and FISH with the HR-CGH diagnostic
  method increases the detection of unbalanced structural chromosomal rearrangements
  and can reveal small cell clones with gains and losses of whole chromosomes in hyperdiploid
  AL.'
