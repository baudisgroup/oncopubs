abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is an established genetic method which
  enables a genome-wide survey of chromosomal imbalances. For each chromosome region,
  one obtains the information whether there is a loss or gain of genetic material,
  or whether there is no change at that place. Therefore, large amounts of data quickly
  accumulate which must be put into a logical order. Cluster analysis can be used
  to assign individual cases samples to different clusters of cases, which are similar
  and where each cluster may be related to a different tumour biology. Another approach
  consists in a clustering of chromosomal regions by rewriting the original data matrix,
  where the cases are written as rows and the chromosomal regions as columns, in a
  transposed form. In this paper we applied hierarchical cluster analysis as well
  as two implementations of self-organizing feature maps as classical and neuronal
  tools for cluster analysis of CGH data from prostatic carcinomas to such transposed
  data sets. Self-organizing maps are artificial neural networks with the capability
  to form clusters on the basis of an unsupervised learning rule. We studied a group
  of 48 cases of incidental carcinomas, a tumour category which has not been evaluated
  by CGH before. In addition we studied a group of 50 cases of pT2N0-tumours and a
  group of 20 pT3N0-carcinomas. The results show in all case groups three clusters
  of chromosomal regions, which are i normal or minimally affected by losses and gains,
  ii regions with many losses and few gains and iii regions with many gains and few
  losses. Moreover, for the pT2N0- and pT3N0-groups, it could be shown that the regions
  6q, 8p and 13q lay all on the same cluster associated with losses , and that the
  regions 9q and 20q belonged to the same cluster associated with gains . For the
  incidental cancers such clear correlations could not be demonstrated.
