abstract: Total genomic DNA sampled from 20 oral squamous cell carcinomas SCCs and
  from four SCC cell lines, was examined for genomic imbalances using comparative
  genomic hybridisation CGH . Gains and losses of DNA copy number aberrations CNAs
  were found in the primary tumours, but also in the cell lines at a varying number.
  The patterns of CNAs proved to be rather peculiar in oral SCCs, gains of genetic
  material clearly dominating compared with losses, and a rather high uniformity of
  these patterns was an impressive finding. Hypersomies of whole chromosomes, e.g.
  numbers 17 and 19 or of whole chromosome arms, e.g. 20q, were particularly evident.
  The segments most frequently gained in oral SCCs were 3q26-q27, 5p15 and 9q34 16
  of 20 tumours each , as well as 1p36.3, 8q24, 10q26, 19 and 20q 15 20 each . Among
  the 15 tumours with more than 10 CNAs, all showed these imbalances. 11q13 was a
  band often involved in increases 14 20 tumours , but in several tumours was involved
  in amplification of DNA copy number. Several other chromosomal segments over represented
  in more than 60 of the tumours, as, for example, 12q24, 15q22-q24, 16p13.2 and 17q
  14 20 tumours each , 6q26-qter, 7p22, 12p12.2-p13, 14q31-q32.2 13 20 and 1q32-q41,
  2q37, 16q23-q24 12 20 each . In contrast, loss of material affected only a few chromosomal
  segments, as, for example, 3p12 12 of the 20 tumours , 5q21 10 20 , 6q13 8 20 .
  The peculiarities of these findings, in some respect, differ from those found in
  other epithelial tumours, suggesting a high impact of environmental factors in the
  generation and progression of these tumours.
