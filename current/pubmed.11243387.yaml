abstract: Secondary chromosomal aberrations in follicle center cell derived lymphomas
  FCDL usually involve gains and losses of genetic material and may be an important
  prognostic value. In the present study, we aimed to determine the power of comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH as compared to standard chromosome analysis CA to detect
  such secondary aberrations. The same lymph node cell suspensions prepared from 30
  patients with FCDL were analyzed in parallel by CGH and CA based on R banding. In
  all, 73 discrepancies were found. Sixty-two imbalances were detected only by CA
  and 11 only by CGH. In cases with completely resolved karyotypes n 17 , the median
  number of discrepancies between CGH and CA was one. However, when the karyotype
  was partially resolved n 12 , the median was four P amp lt 0.01 . Discrepant results
  were further studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization using locus-specific
  probes. These data confirm, that not only for the detection of balanced aberrations,
  but also for the detection of unbalanced aberrations in FCDL, standard chromosome
  analysis is still the gold standard. In contrast, CGH is useful to detect chromosomal
  imbalances when no metaphases are found or no fresh material is available.
