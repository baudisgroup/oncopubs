abstract: Clonal heterogeneity in lymphoid malignancies has been recently reported
  in adult T-cell lymphoma leukemia, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified,
  and mantle cell lymphoma. Our analysis was extended to other types of lymphoma including
  marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. To
  determine the presence of clonal heterogeneity, 332 cases were examined using array
  comparative genomic hybridization analysis. Results showed that incidence of clonal
  heterogeneity varied from 25 to 69 among different types of lymphoma. Survival analysis
  revealed that mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with clonal
  heterogeneity showed significantly poorer prognosis, and that clonal heterogeneity
  was confirmed as an independent predictor of poor prognosis for both types of lymphoma.
  Interestingly, 8q24.1 MYC gain, 9p21.3 CDKN2A 2B loss and 17p13 TP53, ATP1B2, SAT2,
  SHBG loss were recurrent genomic lesions among various types of lymphoma with clonal
  heterogeneity, suggesting at least in part that alterations of these genes may play
  a role in clonal heterogeneity.
