abstract: Several chromosomal regions are recurrently amplified or deleted in lung
  tumors, but little is known about the underlying genes, which could be important
  mediators in tumor formation or progression. In lung cancer, the RB1-CCND1-CDKN2A
  pathway, involved in the G1-S transition, is damaged in nearly all tumors. In the
  present study, we localized a novel amplicon in lung tumors to a fragment of less
  than 0.5 Mb at 12q13.3-q14.1 by using comparative genomic hybridization CGH on cDNA
  microarrays. This approach enabled us to identify 10-15 genes with the most consistent
  amplifications. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of 13 genes in this region showed
  that four of them CDK4, CYP27B1, METTL1, and TSFM were also highly up-regulated.
  Immunohistochemical IHC analysis of 141 tumor samples on a tissue microarray showed
  that CDK4 was expressed at a high level in 23 of lung tumors. Six 21.4 of the tumors
  with high CDK4 expression n 28 were shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH to contain the 12q13.3-q14.1 amplification. For CDK4, a positive correlation
  was found between gene copy number FISH and CGH array , mRNA expression RT-PCR ,
  and level of protein expression IHC . CDK4 expression did not correlate with CDKN2A
  methylation status. Amplification of CDK4 has been described in other tumor types,
  but its role in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. Although CDK4 amplification
  seems to be a relatively rare event 4.3 in lung tumors, it indicates the significance
  of the RB1-CCND1 pathway in lung tumorigenesis.
