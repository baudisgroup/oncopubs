abstract: Metastatic breast cancer is usually diagnosed after becoming symptomatic,
  at which point it is rarely curable. Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) contains
  tumor-specific chromosomal rearrangements that may be interrogated in blood plasma.
  We evaluated serial monitoring of ctDNA for earlier detection of metastasis in a
  retrospective study of 20 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer and long
  follow-up. Using an approach combining low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of primary
  tumors and quantification of tumor-specific rearrangements in plasma by droplet
  digital PCR, we identify for the first time that ctDNA monitoring is highly accurate
  for postsurgical discrimination between patients with (93%) and without (100%) eventual
  clinically detected recurrence. ctDNA-based detection preceded clinical detection
  of metastasis in 86% of patients with an average lead time of 11ï¿½months (range
  0-37ï¿½months), whereas patients with long-term disease-free survival had undetectable
  ctDNA postoperatively. ctDNA quantity was predictive of poor survival. These findings
  establish the rationale for larger validation studies in early breast cancer to
  evaluate ctDNA as a monitoring tool for early metastasis detection, therapy modification,
  and to aid in avoidance of overtreatment.  ï¿½ 2015 The Authors. Published under
