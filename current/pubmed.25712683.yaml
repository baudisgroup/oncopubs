abstract: "Although novel agents targeting the androgen-androgen receptor (AR) axis
  have altered the treatment paradigm of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
  cancer (mCRPC), development of therapeutic resistance is inevitable. In this study,
  we examined whether AR gene aberrations detectable in circulating cell-free DNA
  (cfDNA) are associated with resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide in
  mCRPC patients.  Plasma was collected from 62 mCRPC patients ceasing abiraterone
  acetate (n = 29), enzalutamide (n = 19), or other agents (n = 14) due to disease
  progression. DNA was extracted and subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) for chromosome copy number analysis, and Roche 454 targeted next-generation
  sequencing of exon 8 in the AR.  On aCGH, AR amplification was significantly more
  common in patients progressing on enzalutamide than on abiraterone or other agents
  (53% vs. 17% vs. 21%, P = 0.02, Ï\x87(2)). Missense AR exon 8 mutations were detected
  in 11 of 62 patients (18%), including the first reported case of an F876L mutation
  in an enzalutamide-resistant patient and H874Y and T877A mutations in 7 abiraterone-resistant
  patients. In patients switched onto enzalutamide after cfDNA collection (n = 39),
  an AR gene aberration (copy number increase and/or an exon 8 mutation) in pretreatment
  cfDNA was associated with adverse outcomes, including lower rates of PSA decline
  â\x89¥ 30% (P = 0.013, Ï\x87(2)) and shorter time to radiographic/clinical progression
  (P = 0.010, Cox proportional hazards regression).  AR gene aberrations in cfDNA
  are associated with resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone in mCRPC. Our data
  illustrate that genomic analysis of cfDNA is a minimally invasive method for interrogating
  mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in mCRPC.  Â©2015 American Association for
