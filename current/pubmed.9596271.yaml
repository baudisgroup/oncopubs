abstract: It is not uniformly agreed whether gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs
  are phenotypical variants of leiomyomas cellular leiomyomas or whether they represent
  a separate, genotypically definable entity. In an attempt to solve this question,
  we examined immunohistochemically defined leiomyomas from the esophagus and uterus,
  gastric schwannomas, and benign gastrointestinal stromal tumors GIST by comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . All 14 leiomyomas nine esophageal, five uterine were
  actin- and desmin-positive but negative for CD34 and S100-protein. Changes in DNA
  copy numbers were seen only in three esophageal leiomyomas. Gains were observed
  in chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 8, and 17, whereas losses were seen in 16p. All schwannomas
  were positive for S100-protein and negative for actin, desmin, and CD34. In schwannomas,
  the only change by CGH was a gain in 11q in one case. The benign GISTs, all from
  the stomach, were positive for CD34 but negative for desmin and S100-protein two
  cases were positive for actin. The CGH findings in the GISTs differed markedly from
  those in leiomyomas and schwannomas. Ten of the 13 cases 77 showed DNA copy number
  losses in 14q, and additional or other losses were found in eight cases, most often
  in chromosome 22 seven cases , 15 three cases , and 1p two cases . Furthermore,
  two of the GISTs showed gains in 5q. These results indicate that phenotypically
  undifferentiated GISTs are also genetically different from leiomyomas and schwannomas
  and support their classification apart from leiomyomas.
