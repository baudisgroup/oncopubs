abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC is a genetically complex tumor type
  and a major cause of cancer related mortality. Although distinct genetic alterations
  have been linked to ESCC development and prognosis, the genetic alterations have
  not gained clinical applicability. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH to obtain a whole genome copy number profile relevant for identifying deranged
  pathways and clinically applicable markers.
