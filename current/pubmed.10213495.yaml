abstract: Esophageal cancer EC is the leading cause of cancer death in the Black male
  population in South Africa. Although several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
  have previously been found altered in this cancer, many novel genes remain to be
  identified. To identify the chromosomal location of these unknown genes, we have
  analyzed DNA of 29 South African EC patients by comparative genomic hybridization.
  Frequent loss occurred at chromosome 1p 52 , 4p 52 , 18q 48 , 19p 52 , 19q 55 ,
  and 22q 41 . The most common gains were detected at 1q 41 , 2q 52 , 3q 72 , 5p 31
  , 7p 48 , 7q 45 , 8q 55 , and Xq 69 . High level amplification was detected at 2q24-33,
  6p21.1-q14, 7p12-q21, 7q11.2-31, 8q22-24, 8q13-qter, 13q21-34, and at 13q32-34.
  The present comparative genomic hybridization study opens the way for additional
  targeted studies on these particular chromosomal regions to identify the specific
  genes involved in the higher susceptibility to specific subtypes of esophageal carcinoma
  in different geographical regions. The loss of 8p 28 and Xp 17 in tumors of male
  individuals may provide clues to the basis of the sex-biased frequency of occurrence
  of EC favoring men.
