abstract: Natural killer NK -cell malignancies are among the most aggressive lymphoid
  neoplasms with very poor prognosis. We performed array comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis on a number of NK cell lines and primary tumors to gain better understanding
  of the pathogenesis and tumor biology of these malignancies. We also obtained transcriptional
  profiles of genes residing in these regions and compared them with normal and activated
  NK cells. Only 30-50 of the genes residing in the gained or deleted regions showed
  corresponding increased or decreased expression. However, many of the upregulated
  genes in regions of gain are functionally important for the proliferation and growth
  of the neoplastic population. Genes downregulated in regions of loss included many
  transcription factors or repressors, tumor suppressors or negative regulators of
  the cell cycle. The minimal common region of deletion in 6q21 included three known
  genes PRDM1, ATG5 and AIM1 showing generally low expression. Mutations resulting
  in truncated PRDM1 and changes in conserved amino-acid sequences of AIM1 were detected.
  Highly methylated CpG islands 5 of PRDM1 and AIM1 correlated with low expression
  of the transcripts. Reversal of methylation by Decitabine induced expression of
  PRDM1 and cell death. In conclusion, we have shown a general tumor-promoting effect
  of genetic alterations and have identified PRDM1 as the most likely target gene
  in del6q21. ATG5, an essential gene for autophagy and AIM1, a gene implicated in
  melanoma, may also participate in the functional abnormalities.
