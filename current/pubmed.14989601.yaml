abstract: Loss of genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long
  arm of chromosome 19 in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas has been shown to predict
  responsiveness to chemotherapy. Currently, the most common approach used to detect
  this loss of 1p 19q material employs microsatellite FISH analysis using markers
  along the length of these chromosome arms. This analysis is highly focused and carried
  out on a locus-by-locus basis and gives no indication of the extent of other genetic
  changes occurring in the tumor cells, which may be important in future studies to
  explore genetic heterogeneity in the response to treatment. We have investigated
  the use of comparative genomic hybridization arrays CGHa of bacterial artificial
  chromosomes BACs in the identification of tumor samples that carry loss of the 1p
  19q chromosome arms. These BAC arrays carry approximately 6,000 BAC clones and provide
  an average inter-BAC resolution of 500 Kb. Using this approach we have clearly shown
  that 1p 19q loss in these cases, when compared with microsatellite-mediated detection
  of loss of heterozygosity, is due to physical hemizygous deletion of the whole chromosome
  arms in all cases. Furthermore, CGHa allows the simultaneous definition of the other
  genetic changes that are occurring in the tumors. From our survey of 14 tumors consisting
  of low-grade oligodendrogliomas n 6 , anaplastic oligodendrogliomas n 5 , or mixed
  oligoastrocytoma n 3 . we were able to demonstrate the presence of additional genetic
  markers that were characteristic of the various grades of tumors as well as novel
  changes that had occurred. Thus, CGHa provides a robust, high throughput, genome-wide
  analysis of genetic changes of oligodendroglial tumors that can be used not only
  to predict chemo-responsiveness but also place these genetic changes in the context
  of other abnormalities in the same experiment without the need for extensive chromosome
  or LOH analysis.
