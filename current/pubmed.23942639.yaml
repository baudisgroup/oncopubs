abstract: We report a rare case of peripheral T-cell lymphoma arising in a 52-year-old
  man with biopsy-proven aggressive polymyositis, who had cardiac involvement, progressive
  bulbar symptoms, and died 11 months post diagnosis due to multiorgan failure. Using
  a multimodality approach including immunohistochemistry, genome-wide single nucleotide
  polymorphism SNP -array analysis, and high-throughput sequencing of the complementary
  determining region 3 CDR3 of T-cell receptor beta TCR genes, our study demonstrates
  a molecular link between polymyositis and T-cell lymphoma, and provides evidence
  of the rapid and possibly late occurrence of genomic instability during neoplastic
  transformation of an oligoclonal T-cell population. Immunohistochemical analysis
  revealed loss of CD5, CD7, and CD8 antigen expression in autopsy tissue samples,
  as well as the occurrence of aberrant CD56 expression, not seen in pre-mortem biopsies,
  supporting the emergence of a neoplastic T-cell population. Multiplex polymerase
  chain reaction and next-generation sequencing of the TCR CDR3 region displayed two
  unique T-cell clones in both the diagnostic biopsy confirming polymyositis and the
  autopsy muscle tissue exhibiting T-cell lymphoma, linking the two pathological processes.
  SNP-array analysis revealed complex genomic abnormalities at autopsy but not in
  the pre-mortem muscle biopsies displaying polymyositis, confirming malignant transformation
  of the oligoclonal T-cell infiltrate. Our findings raise the possibility that clinically
  aggressive polymyositis might represent a preneoplastic condition in some instances,
  similar to certain other autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
