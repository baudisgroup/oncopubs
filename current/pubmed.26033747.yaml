abstract: "Chromosomal abnormalities are important in the diagnosis and prognosis
  of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genomic microarray techniques detect
  recurrent copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) in addition to copy number
  aberrations. However, the clinical utility has not been fully established. Therefore,
  in the current study, the authors examined the prognostic impact of acquired cnLOH
  in patients with AML, including complete remission (CR) rate, duration of CR, and
  overall survival (OS).  A total of 112 consecutive patients with AML who were undergoing
  chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT) at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance were
  included in the current study. DNA from the bone marrow or blood was analyzed with
  a microarray platform with both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes and
  non-SNP probes to identify acquired cnLOH. Results were correlated with cytogenetic,
  molecular, immunophenotypic, and other clinicopathological findings.  Patients with
  cnLOH demonstrated a shorter duration of CR (hazard ratio, 1.87; P =.04) and worse
  OS (HR, 1.82; Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x89.03). Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent
  predictive value of cnLOH for early disease recurrence (P =.02). These results largely
  reflected those in patients with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics. Most
  strikingly, 13q cnLOH was found to demonstrate a 6.64-fold higher rate of disease
  recurrence (P =.006) and 3.45-fold worse OS (Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x89.02) and was enriched
  with the FLT3-ITD (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication) mutation.
  \ CnLOH has important prognostic significance in patients with AML. CGAT can replace
  imbalance fluorescence in situ hybridization and the authors recommend the routine
  use of CGAT to detect cnLOH, particularly among patients with intermediate-risk
  cytogenetics. Cancer 2015. Â© 2015 American Cancer Society.  Â© 2015 American Cancer
