abstract: Chromosomal translocations in hematological malignancies often result in
  novel fusion chimeric genes. We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia with a clonal
  translocation t 11 12 p15 q13 displaying morphologic and immunophenotypic features
  resembling the classical hypergranular subtype of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
  The gene fused to NUP98 nucleoporin 98 was detected by comparative genomic hybridization
  array as the retinoid acid receptor gamma gene RARG . The involvement of RARG in
  a chimeric fusion transcript has not been reported previously in human leukemia.
