abstract: K-ras mutations occur frequently in epithelial cancers. Using short hairpin
  RNAs to deplete K-Ras in lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines harboring K-ras mutations,
  two classes were identified-lines that do or do not require K-Ras to maintain viability.
  Comparing these two classes of cancer cells revealed a gene expression signature
  in K-Ras-dependent cells, associated with a well-differentiated epithelial phenotype,
  which was also seen in primary tumors. Several of these genes encode pharmacologically
  tractable proteins, such as Syk and Ron kinases and integrin beta6, depletion of
  which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transformation EMT and apoptosis specifically
  in K-Ras-dependent cells. These findings indicate that epithelial differentiation
  and tumor cell viability are associated, and that EMT regulators in amp quot K-Ras-addicted
  amp quot cancers represent candidate therapeutic targets.
