abstract: In animal and laboratory models, cancer-associated stroma, or elements of
  the supporting tissue surrounding a primary tumor, has been shown to be necessary
  for tumor evolution and progression. However, little is understood or studied regarding
  the properties of intact stroma in human cancer in vivo. In addition, for breast
  cancer patients, the optimal volume of local tissue to treat surrounding a primary
  tumor is not clear. Here, we performed an interdisciplinary study of normal-appearing
  breast tissue using breast magnetic resonance imaging MRI , correlative histology
  and array comparative genomic hybridization to identify a cancer-associated stroma
  in humans. Using a novel technique for segmenting breast fibroglandular tissue,
  quantifiable topographic percent enhancement mapping of the stroma surrounding invasive
  breast cancer was found to be significantly elevated within 2 cm of the tumor edge.
  This region was also found to harbor increased microvessel density, and genomic
  changes that were closely associated with host normal breast tissue. These findings
  indicate that a cancer-associated stroma may be identified and characterized in
  human breast cancer using non-invasive imaging techniques. Identification of a cancer-associated
  stroma may be further developed to help guide local therapy to reduce recurrence
  and morbidity in breast cancer patients.
