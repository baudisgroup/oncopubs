abstract: "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common disease with highly variable
  clinical course. Several recurrent chromosomal alterations are associated with prognosis
  and may guide risk-adapted therapy. We have developed a targeted genome-wide array
  to provide a robust tool for ascertaining abnormalities in CLL and to overcome limitations
  of the 4-marker fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). DNA from 180 CLL patients
  were hybridized to the qChipÂ®Hemo array with a high density of probes covering
  commonly altered loci in CLL (11q22-q23, 13q14, and 17p13), nine focal regions (2p15-p16.1,
  2p24.3, 2q13, 2q36.3-q37.1, 3p21.31, 8q24.21, 9p21.3, 10q24.32, and 18q21.32-q21.33)
  and two larger regions (6q14.1-q22.31 and 7q31.33-q33). Overall, 86% of the cases
  presented copy number alterations (CNA) by array. There was a high concordance of
  array findings with FISH (84% sensitivity, 100% specificity); all discrepancies
  corresponded to subclonal alterations detected only by FISH. A chromothripsis-like
  pattern was detected in eight cases. Three showed concomitant shattered 5p with
  gain of TERT along with isochromosome 17q. Presence of 11q loss was associated with
  shorter time to first treatment (Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x890.003), whereas 17p loss, increased
  genomic complexity, and chromothripsis were associated with shorter overall survival
  (Pâ\x80\x89<â\x80\x890.001, Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x890.001, and Pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x890.02,
  respectively). In conclusion, we have validated a targeted array for the diagnosis
  of CLL that accurately detects, in a single experiment, all relevant CNAs, genomic
  complexity, chromothripsis, copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity, and CNAs
  not covered by the FISH panel. This test may be used as a practical tool to stratify
  CLL patients for routine diagnostics or clinical trials. Â© 2015 The Authors. Genes,
