abstract: The large cell LC subtype is a recently described histologic variant of
  medulloblastoma Mb associated with a rapid and aggressive clinical course. We describe
  the genomic profile of a LC-Mb tumor obtained from a patient who developed recurrent
  and fulminant disease despite good-risk features at diagnosis and state- of-the-art
  multidisciplinary therapy. The tumor sample was analyzed using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH and complementary molecular approaches. CGH revealed amplicons
  at chromosome bands 2p24-25, 2q12-22, and 17p11 losses of chromosomes 11q and 18
  and low-level gains of 3q, 11p, 13q and 14q. Southern blot analysis confirmed N-myc
  amplification. No evidence of p53 mutation was detected. The genomic profile of
  this LC-Mb tumor sample revealed a distinctive pattern of genetic alterations including
  amplification of N-myc and anonymous oncogenes at chromosome bands 2q12-22 and 17p11.
  These genomic abnormalities are uncommon in other subtypes of Mb.
