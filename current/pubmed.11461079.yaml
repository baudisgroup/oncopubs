abstract: Carcinoma in situ CIS or intratubular germ cell neoplasia is generally considered
  the precursor lesion of adult testicular germ cell tumours TGCT . The chromosomal
  imbalances associated with CIS and the corresponding seminoma SE or nonseminoma
  NS have been determined by comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis of microdissected
  material from seven cases. Significantly, the CIS showed no gain of 12p material
  whereas in the invasive components of all cases gain of 12p was found, in 2 cases
  associated with amplification of the 12p11.2-12.1 region. Interphase fluorescence
  in situ analysis was consistent with this and provided evidence for the i 12p or
  12p11.2-12.1 amplification in the SE and NS but not in the corresponding CIS. This
  suggests a role for these changes in progression of CIS to invasive testicular cancer
  or progression of the invasive disease. Other imbalances such as gain of material
  from chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 8, 12q and X and loss of material from chromosome 18 were
  frequently identified amp gt 40 of cases in the CIS associated with both SE and
  NS as well as in the invasive components. Loss of material from chromosome 4 and
  13 and gain of 2p were more frequently found in the invasive components. The results
  shed light on the genetic relationship between the non-invasive and invasive components
  of testicular cancer and the stage at which particular chromosomal changes may be
  important.
