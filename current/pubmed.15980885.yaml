abstract: The question of whether any genetic differences exist between primary and
  colorectal cancers CRCs and their metastatic foci is controversial. To look for
  genetic aberrations involved in metastasis of CRCs to the liver, we performed subtractive
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH experiments using paired samples from 20 CRC
  patients with primary tumors and synchronous or metachronous liver metastases. Relatively
  frequent gains in DNA copy number were detected at 6p, suggesting the presence of
  one or more metastasis-related genes in the region. Analysis of 11 CRC cell lines
  using array-based CGH CGH-array revealed one 6p candidate gene, CCND3. Quantitative
  reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that CCND3 was
  significantly upregulated in liver-metastatic lesions compared with primary lesions
  P amp lt 0.0152 . In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of 120 primary CRC tumors
  demonstrated that cyclin D3 expression in the region of rolled edge was significantly
  associated with total recurrence, especially hematogenous recurrence P 0.0307 .
  The results implied involvement of cyclin D3 in liver metastasis of CRC, and the
  data may contribute to the development of a novel therapy or diagnostic agent for
  this currently intractable disease. Our experiments also confirmed the power of
  subtractive CGH and CGH-array analysis for identifying cancer-related genes.
