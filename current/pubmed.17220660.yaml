abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNST are rarely encountered in
  the paranasal sinuses and frontal skull base. We present histopathological findings,
  cytometric DNA measurements, and the preliminary results of comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis of a 46-year-old male patient with a frontobasal MPNST. The
  tumor was resected via the endonasal approach. No tumor recurrence was detected
  during a follow-up of three years. Rhinologists are being more frequently involved
  in endonasal tumor resection.
