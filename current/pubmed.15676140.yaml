abstract: To clarify the correlation of genomic alterations with clinical and histological
  features, we performed metaphase comparative genomic hybridization analysis on 20
  primary cutaneous melanomas, which were obtained by laser capture or manual microdissection,
  and 16 melanoma cell lines. There were no differences in the average number of aberrations
  between acral melanomas AM and non-AM, although gains of 5q and 11q13 were more
  frequent P 0.05 and 10q loss was less frequent P 0.01 in AM than in non-AM. Although
  tumor thickness is considered a measurable estimate of clinical expression, there
  were no differences in the average number of aberrations among 4 groups, classified
  by thickness of the tumor. While the majority of aberrations were equally distributed
  among the 4 groups, 6p gains were found only in the thickest tumors. Patients with
  6p or 1q gains had a lower overall survival rate than those without them P 0.0002
  or P 0.013 . While gains of 1q, 2q, 3p, 3q, 7q, 20p, and 20q were more frequent
  in the cell lines than in the primary tumors P amp lt 0.01 , losses of 6q, 9p, 10p,
  and 10q were equally found in both cell lines and primary tumors. The present study
  showed that chromosomal aberrations had already occurred in the thinner tumors,
  and that 6p and 1q gains may be a prognostic factor.
