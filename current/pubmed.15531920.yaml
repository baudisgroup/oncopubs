abstract: 'Microsatellite-stable, near-diploid MSI-CIN- colorectal carcinomas have
  been reported, but it is not clear as to whether these tumours form a discrete group
  or represent one end of the distribution of MSI-CIN cancers. In order to address
  this question, we screened 23 MSI-CIN- colorectal cancers for gains and losses using
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH based on large-insert clones
  at about 1 Mb density. We compared our findings with those from a small set of MSI
  CIN cancers, and with our reported data from MSI-CIN and MSI CIN- cancers. We found
  no evidence of any form of genomic instability in MSI-CIN- cancers. At the level
  of the chromosome arm, the MSI-CIN- cancers had significantly fewer gains and losses
  than MSI-CIN tumours, but more than the MSI CIN- and MSI CIN lesions. The chromosomal-scale
  changes found in MSI-CIN- cancers generally involved the same sites as those in
  MSI-CIN tumours, and in both cancer groups, the best predictor of a specific change
  was the total number of such changes in that tumour. A few chromosomal-scale changes
  did, however, differ between the MSI-CIN- and MSI-CIN pathways. MSI-CIN- cancers
  showed: low frequencies of gain of 9p and 19p infrequent loss of 5q and a high frequency
  of 20p gain. Overall, our data suggested that the MSI-CIN- group is heterogeneous,
  one type of MSI-CIN- cancer having few amp lt or 6 chromosomal-scale changes and
  the other with more amp gt or 10 changes resembling MSI-CIN cancers. At the level
  of individual clones, frequent and or discrete gains or losses were generally located
  within regions of chromosomal-scale changes in both MSI-CIN- and MSI-CIN cancers,
  and fewer losses and gains were present in MSI-CIN- than MSI-CIN tumours. No changes
  by clone, which were specific to the MSI-CIN- cancers, were found. In addition to
  indicating differences among the cancer groups, our results also detected over 50
  sites amplifications, potential homozygous deletion and gains or losses which extended
  over only a few megabases which might harbour uncharacterized oncogenes or tumour
  suppressor loci. In conclusion, our data support the suggestion that some MSI-CIN-
  carcinomas form a qualitatively different group from the other cancer types, and
  also suggest that the MSI-CIN- group is itself heterogeneous.'
