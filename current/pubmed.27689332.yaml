abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) often has a worse prognosis following
  its progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), despite radical cystectomy
  with pelvic lymph node dissection combined with chemotherapy. Therefore, the discovery
  of novel biomarkers for predicting the progression of this disease and of therapeutic
  targets for preventing it is crucial. We performed whole-exome sequencing to analyze
  superficial tumor tissues (Tsup) and basal tumor tissues (Tbas) from 3 MIBC patients
  and identified previously unreported copy number variations in IPO11 that warrants
  further investigation as a molecular target. In addition, we identified a significant
  association between the absolute copy number and mRNA expression of IPO11 and found
  that high importin-11 expression was correlated with poor 3-year overall survival
  (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and cancer-free survival (CFS) compared with
  low expression in the BCa patients. Importin-11 overexpression was also an independent
  risk factor for CSS and CFS in the BCa patients. Our study has revealed that IPO11
  copy number amplification contributes to its overexpression and that these changes
  are unfavorable prognostic factors in NMIBC. Thus, IPO11 copy number amplification
  and importin-11 overexpression are promising biomarkers for predicting the progression
  and poor prognosis of patients with NMIBC.
