abstract: Deletion in chromosome 9p involving the CDKN2A locus 9p21.3 is known in
  many malignancies. To detect this deletion in adolescent ALL patients we used oligo
  array CGH and studied 54 patients aged 10-25 years. Deletion rate was 25 54 46 ,
  of these 19 25 76 were homozygous. Small deletions amp lt 200 kb were found in 8
  25 32 and the smallest deletion was amp lt 30 kb. The only gene affected in all
  deletions was CDKN2A. We were unable to demonstrate prognostic value of the deletion,
  however patients with deletion belonged more often P 0.06 to unfavorable biological
  category. Our results indicate that CDKN2A deletions amp lt 200 kb may not be detected
  by conventional methods.
