abstract: Genetic changes orchestrated by human papillomaviruses are the most important
  known factors in carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix. However, it is clear that
  additional genetic events are necessary for tumour progression. We have used comparative
  genomic hybridization to document non-random chromosomal gains and losses within
  a subset of 37 cervical carcinomas matched for clinical stage Ib, but with different
  lymph node status. There were significantly more chromosomal changes in the primary
  tumours when the lymph nodes were positive for metastases. The most frequent copy
  number alterations were loss of 3p, 11q, 6q and 10q and gain of 3q. The smallest
  areas of loss and gain on chromosome 3 were 3p14-22 and 3q24-26. The study identifies
  progressive DNA copy number changes associated with early-stage invasive cervical
  cancers with and without lymph node metastases, a factor of potential prognostic
  and therapeutic value.
