abstract: Li-Fraumeni syndrome LFS represents an inherited tumor syndrome that is
  typically caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene TP53. TP53 dysfunction
  secondarily disturbs the genetic integrity of the cell. Here, we report a family
  with LFS harboring a germline TP53 mutation R248W located in the functional domain
  of the protein that binds to the minor groove of the DNA. In this family, tumors
  of the central nervous system were diagnosed as primary malignancies in all carriers
  of the mutation. The index patient developed an anaplastic medulloblastoma with
  unusual genomic profile exhibiting six distinct high-level genomic amplifications,
  two of them targeting the MYCN and GLI2 genes, respectively. In an extrarenal rhabdoid
  tumor from the same patient, we found a novel high-level amplification of the MYC
  oncogene. The father of this patient was diagnosed with myxopapillary ependymoma
  WHO degrees I , whereas a brother died from an early relapse of a choroid plexus
  carcinoma. The analysis of this LFS familiy thus revealed novel oncogene amplifications
  as different second hits that are likely to also play a role in the pathogenesis
  of their sporadic counterparts.
