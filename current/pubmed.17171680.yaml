abstract: 'The identification of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in
  regions of recurrent aneuploidy is a major challenge of molecular cancer research.
  Using both oligonucleotide single-nucleotide polymorphism and mRNA expression arrays,
  we integrated genomic and transcriptional information to identify and prioritize
  candidate cancer genes in regions of increased and decreased chromosomal copy number
  in a cohort of primary breast cancers. Confirming the validity of this approach,
  several regions of previously-known copy number CN alterations in breast cancer
  could be successfully reidentified. Focusing on regions of decreased CN, we defined
  a prioritized list of eighteen candidate genes, which included ARPIN, FBN1, and
  LZTS1, previously shown to be associated with cancers in breast or other tissue
  types, and novel genes such as P29, MORF4L1, and TBC1D5. One such gene, the RUNX3
  transcription factor, was selected for further study. We show that RUNX3 is present
  at reduced CNs in proportion to the rest of the tumor genome and that RUNX3 CN reductions
  can also be observed in a breast cancer series from a different center. Using tissue
  microarrays, we demonstrate in an independent cohort of over 120 breast tissues
  that RUNX3 protein is expressed in normal breast epithelium but not fat and stromal
  tissue, and widely down-regulated in the majority of breast cancers amp gt 85 .
  In vitro, RUNX3 overexpression suppressed the invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 breast
  cancer cells in a matrigel assay. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrative
  genomic approaches to identify novel potential cancer-related genes in primary tumors.
