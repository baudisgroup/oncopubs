abstract: The protein kinase gene family is the most frequently mutated in human cancer.
  Previous work has documented activating mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase
  in testicular germ-cell tumors TGCT . To investigate further the potential role
  of mutated protein kinases in the development of TGCT and to characterize the prevalence
  and patterns of point mutations in these tumors, we have sequenced the coding exons
  and splice junctions of the annotated protein kinase family of 518 genes in a series
  of seven seminomas and six nonseminomas. Our results show a remarkably low mutation
  frequency, with only a single somatic point mutation, a K277E mutation in the STK10
  gene, being identified in a total of more than 15 megabases of sequence analyzed.
  Sequencing of STK10 in an additional 40 TGCTs revealed no further mutations. Comparative
  genomic hybridization and LOH analysis using SNP arrays demonstrated that the 13
  TGCTs mutationally screened through the 518 protein kinase genes were uniformly
  aneuploid with consistent chromosomal gains on 12p, 8q, 7, and X and losses on 13q,
  18q, 11q, and 4q. Our results do not provide evidence for a mutated protein kinase
  implicated in the development of TGCT other than KIT. Moreover, they demonstrate
  that the general prevalence of point mutations in TGCT is low, in contrast to the
  high frequency of copy number changes.
