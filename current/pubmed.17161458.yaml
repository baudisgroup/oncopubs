abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is characterized by over-expression of cyclin Dl
  as a result of the characteristic t 11 14 q13 q32 . However, this translocation
  alone has proven not to be sufficient for lymphomagenesis, suggesting the involvement
  of additional alterations. We have characterized 35 cases of MCL by array comparative
  genomic hybridization with an average resolution of 0.97 Mb distributed over the
  complete human genome. The most common alterations were losses in 1p13.2-p31.1,
  6q16.2-q27, 8p21.3, 9p13.2-p24.3, 9q13-q31.3, 11q14.3-q23.3, 13q14.13-q21.31, 13q33.1-q34,
  and 22q11.23-q13.33 and gains involving 3q21.2-q29, 7p12.1-p22.3, 8q24.13-q24.23,
  and 18q21.33-q22.3. Four homozygous deletions were identified in totally three patients
  two overlapping at 1p32.3, and two adjacent at 13q32.3. The homozygous deletions
  at 1p32.3 cover the CDKN2C locus coding for p18 , while the region at 13q32.3 does
  not encompass any known tumor suppressor genes. A gain in 3q was significantly associated
  with shorter survival P 0.047 .
