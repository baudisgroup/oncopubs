abstract: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK -positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma
  ALCL is a T-cell malignancy in which ALK expression is a consequence of the t 2
  5 or a variant translocation involving Chromosome 2. For the most part, this disease
  presents in the pediatric population and most, but not all, patients are successfully
  treated. Although the t 2 5 product nucleophosmin-ALK has been extensively studied
  for its transforming properties, very little is known regarding cooperative genetic
  mutations that may contribute to lymphomagenesis and may predict survival outcome,
  specifically in a purely pediatric population. We set out to determine the frequency
  and positions of genomic imbalances in this relatively rare disease. We collected
  biopsy material from 15 UK-resident children with ALK-expressing ALCL. We performed
  array comparative genomic hybridization at a resolution of 1 MB using DNA isolated
  from tumor tissue. Some of the more common genomic gains were confirmed by quantitative
  PCR. Regions of genomic gain were far more common than losses and were most often
  detected on chromosomes 1-4, 5-12, 14, and 17, with Chromosome 11 being the most
  frequent site of genomic imbalances. Patients with 14 or fewer imbalances had a
  lower overall 3-year survival 87.5-40 , P 0.14 as did patients with gains in the
  regions of DDB1 or BIRC5. A range of genomic imbalances exist in ALK-expressing
  ALCL of a pediatric origin, with a greater number associated with poorer overall
  survival.
