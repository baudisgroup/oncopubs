abstract: Most Wilms tumors are of low stage, favorable histology, and have a high
  likelihood of cure with current multimodal therapy. Despite this, there remains
  a group of patients whose tumors recur for whom intensive salvage regimens result
  in survival of only 50 . Fitting a Cox proportional hazards model to microarray-based
  comparative genomic hybridization aCGH data on 68 Wilms tumor samples, we identified
  a significant correlation between increased copy number at chromosome 15q26.3 insulin-like
  growth factor I receptor IGFIR and tumor relapse adjusted P 0.014 . Wilms tumors
  13 exhibited a low-level gain corresponding to three to four copies of the gene
  by aCGH analysis, 9 of 10 of which exhibited high IGFIR mRNA levels. Although IGFIR
  protein expression was restricted to the epithelial cells of fetal kidney and Wilms
  tumors in most cases, 12 of tumors were also found to express IGFIR in the blastemal
  compartment. Blastemal IGFIR protein expression was associated with an increased
  copy number and a shorter relapse-free survival time P 0.027, log-rank test . In
  addition to the membrane localization, IGFIR was localized to the perinuclear region
  of the blastemal cells in 6 of Wilms tumors. These data provide evidence that an
  increase in IGFIR gene copy number results in aberrant expression in the blastemal
  compartment of some Wilms tumors and is associated with an adverse outcome in these
  patients. These findings suggest the possibility of use of targeted agents in the
  therapy of these children.
