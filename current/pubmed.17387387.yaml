abstract: 'To extend our understanding of potential stepwise genetic alterations that
  may underlie tumor progression from low-grade astrocytomas to glioblastomas, histopathologic
  and comparative genomic hybridization analyses were performed on tumor specimens
  from 68 primary lesions, including 40 glioblastomas, 10 anaplastic and 18 low-grade
  astrocytomas. The number of aberrations per case increased towards the higher grade
  tumors grade II: 1.66 -1.49 grade III: 2.80 -1.68 grade IV: 3.02 -1.07 F 6.955,
  p 0.002 . A gain of 7 7q was common and the most frequently seen aberration in low-grade
  astrocytomas, whereas loss of 10q was the most frequently seen anomaly in anaplastic
  astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Chromosome 7p amplification was only detected in
  glioblastomas. Chromosome 10 10q deletion and combination of 1p, 19q and 17p deletions
  were specific to high-grade astrocytic tumors. Sequences of chromosome 7 and 10
  seem to have pivotal roles in the biology of human gliomas. The genomic copy deletions
  of chromosomes 1p and 19q might provide an alternative mechanism in the genesis
  of astrocytomas.'
