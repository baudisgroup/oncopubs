abstract: Prostate cancer is significantly more common in Western men than in Asian
  men, but the basis for this difference remains unknown. Because genomic studies
  of Asian prostate cancer are very limited, we used a genome-wide approach to reveal
  the genomic alterations in Chinese prostate cancers. We found a significant reduction
  in the frequency of certain somatic genomic changes that are commonly found in Western
  prostate cancers, including the 21q22.2-22.3 deletion, which involves the TMPRSS2:ERG
  fusion gene, and 10q deletion, which causes PTEN inactivation. Array results were
  confirmed by PCR-based molecular copy-number counting in selected samples. The different
  frequencies of these genomic changes were further evaluated by fluorescent in situ
  hybridization and immunohistochemistry analyses of tissue microarray samples. These
  alterations might be key genetic changes underlying the regional ethnic difference
  in clinical incidence and might be induced by specific environmental and or genetic
  risk factors that Western men are exposed to. Our findings suggest that tumors arise
  in Western and Chinese populations by alternative pathogenetic mechanisms.
