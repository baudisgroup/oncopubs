abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization was applied to 51 primary esophageal squamous
  cell carcinomas ESCCs to clarify the relation between DNA sequence copy number aberrations
  DSCNAs and the clinicopathology of the disease. The average number of DSCNAs was
  10.9 DSCNAs tumor 6.1 gains and 4.9 losses , ranging from 1-30 DSCNAs tumor. Gain
  of 3q26-qter and loss of 18q22-qter were detected in amp gt 60 of stage I tumors
  and considered to play an important role in the development of ESCC. Whereas gain
  of 8q24-qter was observed in 82.6 19 of 23 of stage III and IV cancers, it was seen
  in 27.3 3 of 11 of stage I tumors. It is suggested that gain of 8q24-qter plays
  an important role in tumor progression. Gains of 8q24-qter and 20q12-qter and loss
  of 11q22-23 were linked to nodal metastasis P 0.0006, 0.002, and 0.02, respectively
  . Gains of 5p15 and 14q21 were associated with distant organ metastasis after surgery
  P 0.006 and 0.02, respectively . These observations suggest that nodal and distant
  organ metastases involve different genes. Gains of 5p15, 8q24-qter, and 14q21 were
  significantly associated with unfavorable prognosis P 0.0002, 0.007, and 0.04, respectively
  . Multivariate analysis revealed the 5p15 gain to be an independent prognostic marker
  with a higher significance than that of nodal status risk ratio 5.95 P 0.001 . The
  present findings indicate that comparative genomic hybridization analysis may be
  used to predict the likelihood of a poor or favorable outcome in cases of ESCC.
