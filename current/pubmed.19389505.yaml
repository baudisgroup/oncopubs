abstract: Lymphoblastic lymphoma LBL is one of the most frequent occurring pediatric
  non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the WHO classification scheme, pediatric LBL is considered
  to be the same disease entity as pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL . However,
  it is unclear whether the genetic basis of pediatric LBL development is similar
  to that of pediatric ALL. We performed genome-wide analyses of copy number aberrations
  in 12 T-LBL and 7 precursor B-cell LBL pediatric cases using high-resolution SNP-based
  array CGH. Similar to what previously has been found in T-ALL, T-LBL exhibited recurrent
  deletions of the CDKN2A locus, occurring in 92 of the cases. Additionally, we detected
  deletions of RB1 16 , duplications of MYB 16 , and an amplification of ABL1 in one
  case. These results show that, similar to T-ALL, the genomic alterations in T-LBL
  predominantly target genes involved in cell cycle progression. The majority of precursor
  B-cell LBL was characterized by high-hyperdiploidy 71 , and showed high resemblance
  with high-hyperdiploid precursor B-cell ALL. Taken together, our data suggest that
  pediatric LBL and ALL exhibit similar genomic abnormalities within confined immunophenotypic
  and cytogenetic subgroups, but that the representations of these subgroups differs
  between the two entities.
