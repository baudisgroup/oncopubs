abstract: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective treatments for non-small-cell lung
  cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However,
  relapse typically occurs after an average of 1 year of continuous treatment. A fundamental
  histological transformation from NSCLC to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is observed
  in a subset of the resistant cancers, but the molecular changes associated with
  this transformation remain unknown. Analysis of tumour samples and cell lines derived
  from resistant EGFR mutant patients revealed that Retinoblastoma (RB) is lost in
  100% of these SCLC transformed cases, but rarely in those that remain NSCLC. Further,
  increased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater
  sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed
  cancers compared with resistant NSCLCs. Together, these findings suggest that this
  subset of resistant cancers ultimately adopt many of the molecular and phenotypic
  characteristics of classical SCLC.
