abstract: Invasive lobular carcinoma ILC and lobular carcinoma in situ characteristically
  show loss of E-cadherin expression and so immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin is
  being increasingly used as a tool to differentiate between lobular and ductal lesions
  in challenging situations. However, misinterpretation of amp quot aberrant amp quot
  positive staining may lead some to exclude a diagnosis of lobular carcinoma. E-cadherin
  and beta-catenin immunohistochemistry was analyzed in 25 ILCs. E-cadherin amp quot
  positive amp quot ILCs were subjected to molecular analysis including comparative
  genomic hybridization. Different morphologic components of case 25, showing heterogenous
  E-cadherin expression, were analyzed by E-cadherin gene sequencing, methylation,
  and DASL gene expression profiling. Four ILCs were positive for E-cadherin, but
  each also had neoplastic cells with aberrant staining. Two of these ILCs were positive
  for beta-catenin, again with some aberrantly stained neoplastic cells, and 2 were
  negative. The solid component of case 25 was positive for E-cadherin whereas the
  classic and alveolar areas were negative. All components harbored an in-frame deletion
  in exon 7 867del24 of the E-cadherin gene and loss of the wild type allele. Comparative
  genomic hybridization demonstrated evidence of clonal evolution from E-cadherin-positive
  to E-cadherin-negative components. E-cadherin down-regulation seems to be through
  transcriptional repression via activation of transforming growth factor-beta SMAD2
  rather than methylation. Positive staining for E-cadherin should not preclude a
  diagnosis of lobular in favor of ductal carcinoma. Molecular evidence suggests that
  even when E-cadherin is expressed, the cadherin-catenin complex maybe nonfunctional.
  Misclassification of tumors may lead to mismanagement of patients in clinical practice,
  particularly in the context of in situ disease at margins.
