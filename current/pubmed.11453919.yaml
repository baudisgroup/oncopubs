abstract: Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a neoplasm of mature helper (CD4)
  T lymphocytes. Little is known, however, about the chromosome aberrations associated
  with the pathogenesis of this malignancy. Using molecular cytogenetic techniques
  we, therefore, investigated a 44-year-old man who had a 7-year history of ATLL with
  cutaneous involvement mimicking primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Conventional
  cytogenetics revealed gross chromosomal changes with chromosome numbers ranging
  from 71 to 82. There were structural abnormalities of chromosomes 7 and 9, partial
  deletions of chromosomes 1, 3, 5 and 6, and loss of chromosomes 2, 4, 9, 11--14,
  21 and 22. Multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) identified two
  derivative chromosomes, der(6)t(6;7)(q16;q21) and der(7)t(6;7)(q16;q21)ins(6;12)(q2?;?),
  and a deletion of chromosome 1p. Conventional FISH confirmed the M-FISH findings.
  Comparative genomic hybridization of the blood revealed gains of DNA copy number
  at 1q12--25, 6p24--25, 9p23, 16p13--q13, 17q11--21, 19p13 and 20q13 and loss at
  11p15 while lymph nodes showed gains at 3p22--24, 3q27--29, 7q36 and 15q26 and losses
  at 2p24--25, 2q37, 10p14--15, 11p15, 13q33--34 and 16p13.3. No DNA copy number changes
  were seen in a skin lesion. These results show the extent of genetic abnormalities
  within this malignancy.
