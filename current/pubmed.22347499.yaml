abstract: Runs of homozygosity (ROH) represents extended length of homozygotes on
  a long genomic distance. In oncology, it is known as loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
  if identified exclusively in cancer cell rather than in matched control cell. Studies
  have identified several genomic regions which show consistent ROH in different kinds
  of carcinoma. To query whether this consistency can be observed on broader spectrum,
  both in more cancer types and in wider genomic regions, we investigated ROH patterns
  in the National Cancer Institute 60 cancer cell line panel (NCI-60) and HapMap Caucasian
  healthy trio families. Using results from Affymetrix 500 K SNP arrays, we report
  a genome wide significant association of ROH regions between the NCI-60 and HapMap
  samples, with much a higher level of ROH (11 fold) in the cancer cell lines. Analysis
  shows that more severe ROH found in cancer cells appears to be the extension of
  existing ROH in healthy state. In the HapMap trios, the adult subgroup had a slightly
  but significantly higher level (1.02 fold) of ROH than did the young subgroup. For
  several ROH regions we observed the co-occurrence of fragile sites (FRAs). However,
  FRA on the genome wide level does not show a clear relationship with ROH regions.
