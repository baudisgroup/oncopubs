abstract: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues are a vast resource of annotated
  clinical samples. As such, they represent highly desirable and informative materials
  for the application of high definition genomics for improved patient management
  and to advance the development of personalized therapeutics. However, a limitation
  of FFPE tissues is the variable quality of DNA extracted for analyses. Furthermore,
  admixtures of non-tumor and polyclonal neoplastic cell populations limit the number
  of biopsies that can be studied and make it difficult to define cancer genomes in
  patient samples. To exploit these valuable tissues we applied flow cytometry-based
  methods to isolate pure populations of tumor cell nuclei from FFPE tissues and developed
  a methodology compatible with oligonucleotide array CGH and whole exome sequencing
  analyses. These were used to profile a variety of tumors (breast, brain, bladder,
  ovarian and pancreas) including the genomes and exomes of matching fresh frozen
  and FFPE pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples.
