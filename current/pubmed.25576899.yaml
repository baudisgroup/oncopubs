abstract: 'Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a frequently lethal malignancy that
  is often unresponsive to available therapeutic strategies. The tumorigenesis of
  ATC and its relationship to the widely prevalent well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas
  are unclear. We have analyzed 22 cases of ATC as well as 4 established ATC cell
  lines using whole-exome sequencing. A total of 2674 somatic mutations (121/sample)
  were detected. Ontology analysis revealed that the majority of variants aggregated
  in the MAPK, ErbB and RAS signaling pathways. Mutations in genes related to malignancy
  not previously associated with thyroid tumorigenesis were observed, including mTOR,
  NF1, NF2, MLH1, MLH3, MSH5, MSH6, ERBB2, EIF1AX and USH2A; some of which were recurrent
  and were investigated in 24 additional ATC cases and 8 ATC cell lines. Somatic mutations
  in established thyroid cancer genes were detected in 14 of 22 (64%) tumors and included
  recurrent mutations in BRAF, TP53 and RAS-family genes (6 cases each), as well as
  PIK3CA (2 cases) and single cases of CDKN1B, CDKN2C, CTNNB1 and RET mutations. BRAF
  V600E and RAS mutations were mutually exclusive; all ATC cell lines exhibited a
  combination of mutations in either BRAF and TP53 or NRAS and TP53. A hypermutator
  phenotype in two cases with >8 times higher mutational burden than the remaining
  mean was identified; both cases harbored unique somatic mutations in MLH mismatch-repair
  genes. This first comprehensive exome-wide analysis of the mutational landscape
  of ATC identifies novel genes potentially associated with ATC tumorigenesis, some
  of which may be targets for future therapeutic intervention.  ï¿½ The Author 2015.
