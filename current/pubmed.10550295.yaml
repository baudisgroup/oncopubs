abstract: Putative natural killer NK cell lymphoma leukemia is a rare group of recently
  characterized hematolymphoid malignancies. They are highly aggressive and frequently
  present in extranodal sites, including the nasal area and the upper aerodigestive
  system, and nonnasal areas such as the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. According
  to clinicopathological features, they can be classified into nasal NK cell lymphoma,
  nasal-type NK cell lymphoma occurring in nonnasal areas, and NK cell lymphoma leukemia.
  Genetic alterations in NK cell lymphoma leukemia are not well defined. In this study,
  we have performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH on DNA extracted from fresh
  or frozen tissues of 10 patients with NK cell lymphoma leukemia. They comprised
  four nasal NK cell lymphomas, one nasal-type NK cell lymphoma, and five NK cell
  lymphomas leukemias. CGH showed frequent deletions at 6q16-q27 four cases , 13q14-q34
  three cases , 11q22-q25 two cases , 17p13 two cases , and loss of the whole chromosome
  X two cases . DNA amplification was observed in a majority of the chromosomes. Five
  cases showed DNA gains at region 1p32-pter. Frequent DNA gains were also found in
  chromosomes 6p, 11q, 12q, 17q, 19p, 20q, and Xp three cases each . Interestingly,
  DNA gains were more frequent in nasal nasal-type NK cell lymphomas than NK cell
  lymphoma leukemia. These genetic alterations correlated well with karyotypic features
  found in some of the cases. The frequent DNA losses at 6q and 13q suggest that the
  presence of tumor suppressor genes at these regions is important in NK cell transformation.
  In addition to establishing novel patterns of genomic imbalances in these rare NK
  cell malignancies, which may be targets for future molecular analysis, this study
  also provides important information on genetic alterations in NK cell lymphomas
  that may be useful in defining their positions in current lymphoma classification
  schemes, which are increasingly focusing on phenotypic and genotypic correlations.
