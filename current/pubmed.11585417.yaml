abstract: We analyzed the mutational status of the transforming growth factor-beta
  type II receptor TGF beta RII , BAX, and PTEN MMAC1 genes as well as microsatellite
  instability MI in 29 consecutive cases of endometrial carcinoma operated on at the
  Cancer Institute Hospital Tokyo, Japan . To identify chromosomal loss associated
  with significant somatic mutations, we conducted comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis.
