abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to examine gains and losses
  in 18 meningioma tumors that had been previously analyzed for loss of heterozygosity
  LOH at 22q12. Partial or complete losses were seen by CGH in only 9 of 18 cases
  on chromosome 22. This compares with 11 of 18 losses of single or more loci by LOH.
  The discrepancy in these results in probably explained by the increased sensitivity
  of LOH by using microsatellite markers that are able to detect small deletions,
  whereas losses on the order of 10-15 megabases are required for confident identification
  by CGH. There was no consistent pattern of gains or losses by CGH, including those
  tumors that lacked LOH at 22q12. In one tumor of interest in which CGH and LOH studies
  failed to demonstrate loss on chromosome 22, CGH identified an area of amplification
  at 17q22-23.
