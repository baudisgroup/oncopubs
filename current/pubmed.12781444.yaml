abstract: The most common treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL is the alkylating
  agent chlorambucil CLB , with or without prednisone. In the present study, our aim
  was to evaluate whether treatment with CLB for more than one year induced genetic
  changes manifested by comparative genomic hybridization CGH as new chromosomal aberrations.
  We also studied whether CLB affected the pattern of replication by using fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH . We found a similar rate of asynchronous pattern of
  replication in both treated and untreated patients with CLL. Most of the aberrations
  found with CGH were previously reported in CLL. More prognostically unfavorable
  aberrations and more cases with genetic changes were found in the treated group.
  The changes found were not typical of the secondary genetic aberrations associated
  with alkylating agents. Thus, we conclude that treatment of CLL with CLB for at
  least a year does not affect the parameters analyzed in this study. Longer studies
  are needed to further explore the effects of alkylating agents on normal and malignant
  cells.
