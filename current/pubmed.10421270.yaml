abstract: Intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETs occur in the supratentorial
  and infratentorial regions of the brain. Although histologically similar, the natural
  history of the tumor at each site differs. The study goal was to determine whether
  there was evidence of a genetic difference between supratentorial and infratentorial
  PNETs.
