abstract: We used a combination of spectral karyotyping, array comparative genomic
  hybridization, and cDNA microarrays to gain insights into the structural and functional
  changes of the genome in the MCF10 human breast cancer progression model cell lines.
  Spectral karyotyping data showed several chromosomal aberrations and array comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis identified numerous genomic gains and losses that
  might be involved in the progression toward cancer. Analysis of the expression levels
  of genes located within these genomic regions revealed a lack of correlation between
  chromosomal gains and losses and corresponding up-regulation or down-regulation
  for the majority of the approximately 1,000 genes analyzed in this study. We conclude
  that other mechanisms of gene regulation that are not directly related to chromosomal
  gains and losses play a major role in breast cancer progression.
