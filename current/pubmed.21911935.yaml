abstract: Somatic mutations and copy number alterations (as a result of deletion or
  amplification of large portions of a chromosome) are major drivers of human lung
  cancers. Detailed analysis of lung cancer-associated chromosomal amplifications
  could identify novel oncogenes. By performing an integrative cytogenetic and gene
  expression analysis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer
  (SCLC) cell lines and tumors, we report here the identification of a frequently
  recurring amplification at chromosome 11 band p13. Within this region, only TNF
  receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) exhibited concomitant mRNA overexpression and
  gene amplification in lung cancers. Inhibition of TRAF6 in human lung cancer cell
  lines suppressed NF-ÎºB activation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation.
  In these lung cancer cell lines, RAS required TRAF6 for its oncogenic capabilities.
  Furthermore, TRAF6 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells resulted in NF-ÎºB activation,
  anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation. Our findings show that TRAF6
  is an oncogene that is important for RAS-mediated oncogenesis and provide a mechanistic
  explanation for the previously apparent importance of constitutive NF-ÎºB activation
  in RAS-driven lung cancers.
