abstract: Integrative analysis of genomic aberrations in the context of trancriptomic
  alterations will lead to a more comprehensive perspective on prostate cancer progression.
  Genome-wide copy number changes were monitored using array comparative genomic hybridization
  of laser-capture microdissected prostate cancer samples spanning stages of prostate
  cancer progression, including precursor lesions, clinically localized disease, and
  metastatic disease. A total of 62 specific cell populations from 38 patients were
  profiled. Minimal common regions MCR of alterations were defined for each sample
  type, and metastatic samples displayed the most number of alterations. Clinically
  localized prostate cancer samples with high Gleason grade resembled metastatic samples
  with respect to the size of altered regions and number of affected genes. A total
  of 9 out of 13 MCRs in the putative precursor lesion, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
  neoplasia PIN , showed an overlap with prostate cancer cases amplifications in 3q29,
  5q31.3-q32, 6q27, and 8q24.3 and deletions in 6q22.31, 16p12.2, 17q21.2, and 17q21.31
  , whereas postatrophic hyperplasia PAH did not exhibit this overlap. Interestingly,
  prostate cancers that do not overexpress ETS family members i.e., gene fusion-negative
  prostate cancers harbor differential aberrations in 1q23, 6q16, 6q21, 10q23, and
  10q24. Integrative analysis with matched mRNA profiles identified genetic alterations
  in several proposed candidate genes implicated in prostate cancer progression.
