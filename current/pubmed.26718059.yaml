abstract: Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations
  in PKD1 and PKD2 and is characterized by proliferation of renal tubular epithelium
  and progressive chronic kidney disease. Derangements in similar cellular signaling
  pathways occur in ADPKD and renal malignancies, although an association of these
  disorders has not been established. Herein, we present a case of papillary RCC (pRCC)
  incidentally discovered in a patient with ADPKD following bilateral native nephrectomy
  during renal transplantation. Whole exome sequencing of the pRCC found a somatic
  missense mutation in MET proto-oncogene, p.Val1110Ile, not present in kidney cyst
  epithelium or non-cystic tissue. RNA sequencing demonstrated increased mRNA expression
  of MET and pathway-related genes, but no significant copy number variation of MET
  was detected. Genetic analysis of PKD genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes and
  renal cyst epithelium identified a constitutional PKD1 germline mutation, p.Trp1582Ser,
  predicted to be pathogenic. Unique somatic mutations in PKD1 were also detected
  in 80% of the renal cysts analyzed, but not in the pRCC. These results suggest that,
  in this patient, the pRCC utilized a signaling pathway involving MET that was distinct
  from the pathogenesis of ADPKD. This is the first report of PKD1 mutations and a
  somatic mutation of the MET oncogene in a pRCC in ADPKD.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier
