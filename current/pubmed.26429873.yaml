abstract: Although recurrent gene fusions such as JAZF1-JJAZ1 are considered driver
  events for endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) development, other genomic alterations
  remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome
  sequencing and copy number profiling for five ESSs (three low-grade ESS (LG-ESS)
  and two undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (UUSs)). All three LG-ESSs exhibited either
  one of JAZF1-SUZ12, JAZF1-PHF1 and MEAF6-PHF1 fusions, whereas the two UUSs did
  not. All ESSs except one LG-ESS exhibited copy number alterations (CNAs), many of
  which encompassed cancer-related genes. In UUSs, five CNAs encompassing cancer-related
  genes (EZR, CDH1, RB1, TP53 and PRKAR1A) accompanied their expressional changes,
  suggesting that they might stimulate UUS development. We found 81 non-silent mutations
  (35 from LG-ESSs and 46 from UUSs) that included 15 putative cancer genes catalogued
  in cancer-related databases, including PPARG and IRF4 mutations. However, they were
  non-recurrent and did not include any well-known mutations, indicating that point
  mutations may not be a major driver for ESS development. Our data show that gene
  fusions and CNAs are the principal drivers for LG-ESS and USS, respectively, but
  both may require additional genomic alterations including point mutations. These
  differences may explain the different biologic behaviors between LG-ESS and UUS.
  Our findings suggest that ESS development requires point mutations and CNAs as well
  as the gene fusions.
