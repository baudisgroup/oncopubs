abstract: Single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP array analysis was performed using the
  10K GeneChip array on a series of 26 paired follicular lymphoma FL and transformed-FL
  t-FL biopsies and the lymphoma cell lines SCI-1, DoHH2 and RL2261. Regions of acquired
  homozygosity were detected in 43 52 83 primary specimens with a mean of 1.7 and
  3.0 aberrations in the FL and t-FL, respectively. A notable feature was the occurrence
  of recurring sites of acquired uniparental disomy aUDP on 6p, 9p, 12q and 17p in
  cell lines and primary samples. Homozygosity of 9p and 17p arose predominantly in
  t-FL and in three cases rendered the cell homozygous for a pre-existing mutation
  of either CDKN2A or TP53. These data suggest that mutation precedes mitotic recombination,
  which leads to the removal of the remaining wild-type allele. In all, 18 cases exhibited
  abnormalities in both FL and t-FL samples. In 10 cases blocks of homozygosity were
  detected in FL that were absent in the subsequent t-FL sample. These differences
  support the notion that FL and t-FL may arise in a proportion of patients by divergence
  from a common malignant ancestor cell rather than by clonal evolution from an antecedent
  FL.
