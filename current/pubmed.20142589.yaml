abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma DIPG is one of the most devastating of
  pediatric malignancies and one for which no effective therapy exists. A major contributor
  to the failure of therapeutic trials is the assumption that biologic properties
  of brainstem tumors in children are identical to cerebral high-grade gliomas of
  adults. A better understanding of the biology of DIPG itself is needed in order
  to develop agents targeted more specifically to these childrens disease. Herein,
  we address this lack of knowledge by performing the first high-resolution single
  nucleotide polymorphism SNP -based DNA microarray analysis of a series of DIPGs.
