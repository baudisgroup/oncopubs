abstract: Primary cutaneous CD30 large T-cell lymphoma CD30 CTCL is a subset of non-epidermotropic
  primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although frequent spontaneous regression may
  be observed, skin relapses occur frequently. Cytogenetic abnormalities that could
  play a role in CD30 CTCL tumour pathogenesis and relapses remain unknown. The identification
  of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities is hampered by difficulty in culturing tumours
  and the lack of CD30 CTCL serial studies comparing genetic changes both at diagnosis
  and at relapse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cytogenetic abnormalities
  present in a series of 13 CD30 CTCL samples obtained from nine patients fulfilling
  both EORTC and WHO diagnostic criteria, by the use of comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . CGH analysis revealed a non-random distribution of genetic imbalances between
  relapsing and non-relapsing disease. In relapsing disease, chromosomal abnormalities
  were detected both in the primary tumour and in relapses. The mean number of changes
  in non-relapsing disease was 0.33 range 0-1 , compared with 6.29 range 1-16 in relapsing
  disease. The recurrent chromosomes involved in relapsing disease were chromosomes
  6 86 , 9 86 , and 18 43 . While chromosome 9 was mostly affected by gain, chromosomes
  6 and 18 mainly contained regions of loss, exclusively on 6q and 18p. The common
  regions of deletion were 6q21 and 18p11.3. In one patient, we successfully cultured
  tumour cells from a skin biopsy from a second relapse. The G-banded karyotype was
  concordant with both CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH results. Although
  further studies are required to strengthen these data, this CGH analysis demonstrates
  chromosomal imbalances that may be involved in the pathogenesis of relapsing CD30
  CTCL.
