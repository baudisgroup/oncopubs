abstract: To elucidate whether tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI resistance in chronic
  myeloid leukemia is associated with characteristic genomic alterations, we analyzed
  DNA samples from 45 TKI-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients with 250K single
  nucleotide polymorphism arrays. From 20 patients, matched serial samples of pretreatment
  and TKI resistance time points were available. Eleven of the 45 TKI-resistant patients
  had mutations of BCR-ABL1, including 2 T315I mutations. Besides known TKI resistance-associated
  genomic lesions, such as duplication of the BCR-ABL1 gene n 8 and trisomy 8 n 3
  , recurrent submicroscopic alterations, including acquired uniparental disomy, were
  detectable on chromosomes 1, 8, 9, 17, 19, and 22. On chromosome 22, newly acquired
  and recurrent deletions of the IGLC1 locus were detected in 3 patients, who had
  previously presented with lymphoid or myeloid blast crisis. This may support a hypothesis
  of TKI-induced selection of subclones differentiating into immature B-cell progenitors
  as a mechanism of disease progression and evasion of TKI sensitivity.
