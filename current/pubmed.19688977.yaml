abstract: The literature data show that the most frequently affected chromosomes in
  ovarian carcinogenesis are 1, 8 and 17. In the present study we aimed to define
  more precisely at a high resolution the genomic imbalances of these chromosomes
  in ovarian cancer and to determine genomic markers separating tumors of different
  histological types and stages.
