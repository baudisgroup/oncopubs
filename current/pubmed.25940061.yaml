abstract: We present three cases of genetically confirmed Gorlin syndrome with desmoplastic
  medulloblastoma (DMB) in whom tumor recurred despite standard therapy. One patient
  was found to have a novel germline missense PTCH1 mutation. Molecular analysis of
  recurrent tumor using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed PTEN and/
  or PTCH1 loss in 2 patients. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumor in one patient
  revealed loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 and a mutation of GNAS gene in its non-coding
  3' -untranslated region (UTR) with corresponding decreased protein expression. While
  one patient died despite high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) plus stem cell rescue (ASCR)
  and palliative radiotherapy, two patients are currently alive for 18+ and 120+ months
  respectively following retrieval therapy that did not include irradiation. Infants
  with DMB and GS should be treated aggressively with chemotherapy at diagnosis to
  prevent relapse but radiotherapy should be avoided. The use of molecular prognostic
  markers for DMB should be routinely used to identify the subset of tumors that might
  have an aggressive course. Pediatr Blood Cancer ï¿½ 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  ï¿½
