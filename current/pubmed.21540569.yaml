abstract: T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) primarily presenting
  on the skin is an extremely rare entity with only sporadic cases reported in the
  literature.  We here report an extraordinary case of primary cutaneous THRLBCL with
  self-healing and 24 months of follow-up.  The lesion was a dermohypodermal/subcutaneous
  circumscribed ulcerated nodosity. Histological examination with immunohistochemical,
  molecular analysis and comparative genomic hybridization were performed. A complete
  staging was negative for secondary involvement.  Our case is remarkable because
  it is the second well-documented primary cutaneous THRLBCL in which we observed
  a complete self-regression of skin lesions without recurrences or dissemination
  of the disease. According to the literature, we highlight that the tumoral microenvironment,
  in our case, could play a relevant role in stopping lymphoma growth. Furthermore,
  this case supports the observation that THRLBCL primarily presenting on the skin
  shows an overall good prognosis.  Copyright ï¿½ 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.
