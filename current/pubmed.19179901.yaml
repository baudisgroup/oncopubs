abstract: In the rare case of a male patient presenting with a combined small cell
  lung carcinoma SCLC , large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, we
  used whole genome analysis by tiling-path array comparative genomic hybridization
  to evaluate the clonal relationship between nodules. In two areas of SCLC distinguishable
  by divergent neuroendocrine marker expression CD56 and chromogranin-A , the presence
  of identical genomic breakpoints and rearrangements indicated a common origin, with
  the presence of additional distinct genomic alterations in these two components
  indicating diverging clonal evolution. The absence of shared genome alteration features
  for the adenocarcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma components suggested
  that these tumors evolved independently from the SCLC. Taken together, the array
  comparative genomic hybridization data demonstrate the development and evolution
  of three independent primary lung cancers in close proximity to each other to form
  a combined carcinoma. Application of whole genome analysis shows the potential utility
  of high resolution molecular tools in resolving the origin and delineating the clonal
  relationships of a tumor that contains heterogeneous histologic components leading
  to an ambiguous histogenesis.
