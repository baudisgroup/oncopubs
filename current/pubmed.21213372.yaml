abstract: Testicular germ cell tumors TGCT are the most frequent solid tumor to affect
  young adult males and are histologically divided into seminomas and nonseminomas
  NS . NS comprise undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma EC and differentiated tumors
  with embryonic teratoma or extra-embryonic choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor features.
  In contrast to other subtypes, EC have uniform cellular morphology and lack normal
  cell infiltrates, ideal for nucleic acid profiling. EC are under-represented in
  previous studies due to their relative rarity. To gain insights into NS tumorigenesis,
  metastatic dissemination and potential markers of relapse, a full tiling path BAC
  platform was used to obtain array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH profiles
  from 32 formalin fixed paraffin embedded stage I EC samples from patients with follow-up
  data. In addition to identifying regions previously described in TGCT, novel minimum
  overlapping regions of gain at 6p21.33, 10q11.21, and 22q13.32 and loss at 22q12.2
  were defined and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Specifically,
  the region at 6p21.33 included OCT3 4, the expression of which is involved in the
  maintenance of pluripotency and the 10q11.21 region contains the gene encoding the
  RAS activating factor RASGEF1A, the expression of which was demonstrably increased
  in RNA extracted from these samples. The region of loss at 22q12.2 was more frequently
  seen in tumors that relapsed and protein expression of genes from 22q12.2 included
  PIK3IP1, a negative regulator of PI3 kinase signaling was reduced. These data support
  the role for genes involved in pluripotency and RAS PI3K signaling in EC development
  and progression.
