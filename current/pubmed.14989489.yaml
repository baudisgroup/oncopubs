abstract: Staging of prostate cancer is a mainstay of treatment decisions and prognostication.
  In the present study, 50 pT2N0 and 28 pT3N0 prostatic adenocarcinomas were characterized
  by Gleason grading, comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and histological texture
  analysis based on principles of stereology and stochastic geometry. The cases were
  classified by learning vector quantization and support vector machines. The quality
  of classification was tested by cross-validation. Correct prediction of stage from
  primary tumor data was possible with an accuracy of 74-80 from different data sets.
  The accuracy of prediction was similar when the Gleason score was used as input
  variable, when stereological data were used, or when a combination of CGH data and
  stereological data was used. The results of classification by learning vector quantization
  were slightly better than those by support vector machines. A method is briefly
  sketched by which training of neural networks can be adapted to unequal sample sizes
  per class. Progression from pT2 to pT3 prostate cancer is correlated with complex
  changes of the epithelial cells in terms of volume fraction, of surface area, and
  of second-order stereological properties. Genetically, this progression is accompanied
  by a significant global increase in losses and gains of DNA, and specifically by
  increased numerical aberrations on chromosome arms 1q, 7p, and 8p.
