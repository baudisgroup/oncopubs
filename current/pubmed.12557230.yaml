abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the second
  leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. In this study, we
  performed comparative genomic hybridization CGH on 45 primary prostate adenocarcinomas
  to determine genetic markers that could be useful for distinguishing between organ-confined
  and locally advanced prostate cancer. Of these tumors, 24 were pT2 stage, 21 were
  pT3b 20 had low Gleason scores GS , 25 had high GS. The most common chromosomal
  alterations in all 45 tumors included losses on 8p 57.8 , 10q21-- amp gt qter 40.0
  , 16q 35.6 , 11q21-- amp gt qter 28.9 , 16p 22.2 , 6q22-- amp gt 24 22.2 , 10p 20.0
  , 5q31-- amp gt qter 17.8 , 6p 17.8 , 15q22-- amp gt qter 15.6 , and 17p 15.6 as
  well as gains on 7cen-- amp gt p14 20.0 , 7cen-- amp gt q22 20.0 , and Xcen-- amp
  gt q21 17.8 . Contingency table analysis showed that losses of 8p, 10q25-- amp gt
  qter, 6p21, 6q24-- amp gt qter, and 15q22-- amp gt qter were significantly increased
  in frequency P amp lt 0.05 with increasing stage and or GS. A model was created
  following multivariate logistic regression analysis that was predictive of tumor
  stage in approximately 90 of the tumors studied. This model suggests that loss of
  8p is the most valuable predictor of stage. These findings suggest that chromosomal
  regions identified in this study may be useful for distinguishing between organ-confined
  and locally advanced prostate tumors.
