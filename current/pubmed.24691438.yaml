abstract: In multiple forms of cancer, constitutive activation of type I IFN signaling
  is a critical consequence of immune surveillance against cancer; however, PBMCs
  isolated from cancer patients exhibit depressed STAT1 phosphorylation in response
  to IFN-Î±, suggesting IFN signaling dysfunction. Here, we demonstrated in a coculture
  system that melanoma cells differentially impairs the IFN-Î± response in PBMCs and
  that the inhibitory potential of a particular melanoma cell correlates with NOS1
  expression. Comparison of gene transcription and array comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) between melanoma cells from different patients indicated that suppression
  of IFN-Î± signaling correlates with an amplification of the NOS1 locus within segment
  12q22-24. Evaluation of NOS1 levels in melanomas and IFN responsiveness of purified
  PBMCs from patients indicated a negative correlation between NOS1 expression in
  melanomas and the responsiveness of PBMCs to IFN-Î±. Furthermore, in an explorative
  study, NOS1 expression in melanoma metastases was negatively associated with patient
  response to adoptive T cell therapy. This study provides a link between cancer cell
  phenotype and IFN signal dysfunction in circulating immune cells.
