abstract: To define the location of potential oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
  in ocular melanoma we carried out comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis
  on a population-based series of 25 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors
  comprising 17 choroidal, 2 ciliary body, 4 iris, and 2 conjunctival melanomas. Twelve
  48 of the 25 melanomas showed no chromosomal changes and 13 52 had at least one
  chromosomal gain or loss. The mean number of CGH changes in all tumors was 3.3,
  with similar mean numbers of chromosomal gains 1.5 and losses 1.8 . The highest
  number of chromosomal changes i.e., nine occurred in a conjunctival melanoma and
  included four changes not observed in tumors at any other ocular site gains in 22q
  and 11p and losses in 6p and 17p . The most frequent gains in all primary ocular
  melanomas were on chromosome arm 8q 69 , 6p 31 and 8p 23 and the most frequent losses
  were on 6q 38 , 10q 23 , and 16q 23 . The most common pairing was gain in 8p and
  gain in 8q, implying a whole chromosome copy number increase gains in 8p occurred
  only in conjunction with gains in 8q. The smallest regions of copy number alteration
  were mapped to gain of 8q21 and loss of 6q21, 10q21, and 16q22. Sublocalization
  of these chromosomal changes to single-band resolution should accelerate the identification
  of genes involved in the genesis of ocular melanoma.
