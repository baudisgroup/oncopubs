abstract: Despite the fact that numerous studies have been performed on diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma DLBCL , only few have concerned extranodal lymphomas occurring in
  the testis. We performed a cytogenetic and molecular study of 17 testicular non-Hodgkin
  lymphomas, of which 14 were proven primary DLBCL of the testis. Cytogenetic analysis
  revealed in 8 out of 11 evaluable cases a structural abnormality of the long arm
  of chromosome 6, with deletion or addition of material of unknown origin, and with
  breakpoints spanning the region 6q12-6q23. The cytogenetic findings were confirmed
  by fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH with a chromosome 6 painting probe. Using
  array based-comparative genomic hybridization on 16 evaluable cases, including 5
  cases not tested by cytogenetics or FISH, 14 88 showed chromosome 6q deletions.
  We identified two regions of minimal deletion RMD , at 104-113 Mb 6q16.3-q21 and
  137.5-138.8 Mb 6q23.3 , respectively. In one case, we observed a 2.7 Mb homozygous
  deletion ranging from 135.3 to 138.0 Mb that partly overlapped with the RMD at 6q23.3.
  Our study indicates that 6q deletions play a major pathogenetic role in DLBCL of
  the testis and that many of these deletions are part of unbalanced translocations.
