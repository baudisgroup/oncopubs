abstract: We analyzed the genome of a rhabdoid glioblastoma (R-GBM) tumor, a very
  rare variant of GBM. A surgical specimen of R-GBM from a 20-year-old woman was analyzed
  using whole exome sequencing (WES), whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), single
  nucleotide polymorphism array, and array comparative genomic hybridization. The
  status of gene expression in R-GBM tissue was compared with that of normal brain
  tissue and conventional GBM tumor tissue. We identified 23 somatic non-synonymous
  small nucleotide variants with WES. We identified the BRAF V600E mutation and possible
  functional changes in the mutated genes, ISL1 and NDRG2. Copy number alteration
  analysis revealed gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. We found loss of heterozygosity
  and focal homozygous deletion on 9q21, which includes CDKN2A and CDKN2B. In addition,
  WTS revealed that CDK6, MET, EZH2, EGFR, and NOTCH1, which are located on chromosomes
  7 and 9, were over-expressed, whereas CDKN2A/2B were minimally expressed. Fusion
  gene analysis showed 14 candidate genes that may be functionally involved in R-GBM,
  including TWIST2, and UPK3BL. The BRAF V600E mutation, CDKN2A/2B deletion, and EGFR/MET
  copy number gain were observed. These simultaneous alterations are very rarely found
  in GBM. Moreover, the NDRG2 mutation was first identified in this study as it has
  never been reported in GBM. We observed a unique genomic signature in R-GBM compared
  to conventional GBM, which may provide insight regarding R-GBM as a distinct disease
  entity among the larger group of GBMs.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015 The Authors. Published
