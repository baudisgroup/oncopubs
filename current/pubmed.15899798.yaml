abstract: High-resolution genome-wide mapping of exact boundaries of chromosomal alterations
  should facilitate the localization and identification of genes involved in gliomagenesis
  and may characterize genetic subgroups of glial brain tumors. We have done such
  mapping using cDNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization technology
  to profile copy number alterations across 42,000 mapped human cDNA clones, in a
  series of 54 gliomas of varying histogenesis and tumor grade. This gene-by-gene
  approach permitted the precise sizing of critical amplicons and deletions and the
  detection of multiple new genetic aberrations. It has also revealed recurrent patterns
  of occurrence of distinct chromosomal aberrations as well as their interrelationships
  and showed that gliomas can be clustered into distinct genetic subgroups. A subset
  of detected alterations was shown predominantly associated with either astrocytic
  or oligodendrocytic tumor phenotype. Finally, five novel minimally deleted regions
  were identified in a subset of tumors, containing putative candidate tumor suppressor
  genes TOPORS, FANCG, RAD51, TP53BP1, and BIK that could have a role in gliomagenesis.
