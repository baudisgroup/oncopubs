abstract: 'We analyzed quantitative chromosome 14 abnormalities in 124 meningiomas
  by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization iFISH and confirmed the nature
  of abnormalities by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We correlated the abnormalities
  with clinical, histopathologic, and prognostic factors. Of 124 cases, 50 40.3 showed
  loss 14.5 or gain 25.8 of the 14q32 chromosome region by iFISH. Most corresponded
  to numeric abnormalities: monosomy 12.9 , trisomy 1.6 , or tetrasomy 24.2 in only
  2 cases 1.6 , chromosome 14 loss did not involve the whole chromosome and was restricted
  to the 14q31-q32 region confirmed by CGH . Cases with gain or monosomy corresponded
  more frequently to histologically malignant tumors P .009 . Patients with monosomy
  14 14q-, but not those with gain, more often were male P .04 and had a greater incidence
  of recurrence P .003 and shorter relapse-free survival P .03 . The 2 patients with
  loss limited to 14q31-q32 had histologically benign tumors and no relapse after
  more than 5 years follow-up. Most meningiomas with chromosome 14 abnormalities have
  numeric changes, with interstitial deletions of 14q31-q32 present in few cases.
  Of the abnormalities detected, only monosomy 14 showed an adverse prognostic impact.'
