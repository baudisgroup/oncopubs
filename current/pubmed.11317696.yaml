abstract: Colorectal carcinomas are characterized by frequent recurrent gains and
  losses of chromosomal material, especially gains of chromosome arms 20q and 13q,
  and losses of chromosome arms 18q and 4q. These may be important in the development
  and progression of colorectal carcinomas. Chromosomal aberrations detected by comparative
  genomic hybridization in 67 sporadic colorectal carcinomas were examined for their
  possible associations with patient survival. Dukes stage, tumor DNA ploidy status,
  and TP53 genotype phenotype were also examined for the same. Patients with losses
  of chromosomal arms 1p, 4q, 8p, 14q, or 18q or gain of chromosomal arm 20q had significantly
  shorter survival times than those without these aberrations univariate relative
  risk 3.45, 2.71, 3.32, 3.26, 3.32, 3.91, respectively , as did patients with more
  than six chromosomal aberrations per tumor than those with fewer than six aberrations
  univariate relative risk 3.26, P 0.013 . DNA aneuploidy and Dukes stage C D resulted
  in poor patient survival univariate relative risk 3.58, 3.39, respectively . Dukes
  stage C D, 1p loss and 8p loss emerged as the only independent prognostic parameters
  relative risk 3.22, 2.53, 2.45, respectively when entered into multivariate survival
  analysis together with other significant parameters from univariate survival analysis.
  Loss of chromosome arm 1p, 4q, 8p, 14q, or 18q or gain of chromosome arm 20q thus
  results in shortened survival times in colorectal cancer patients. 1p loss and 8p
  loss were shown to be independent predictors of poor prognosis.
