abstract: The pituitary tumor transforming gene PTTG1 is a recently discovered oncogene
  implicated in malignant progression of both endocrine and nonendocrine malignancies.
  Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC is cytogenetically characterized by chromosome
  3p deletions that harbor the ccRCC-related von Hippel-Lindau, PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2
  tumor suppressor genes, along with chromosome 5q amplifications where the significance
  has been unclear. PTTG1 localizes to the chromosome 5q region where amplifications
  occur in ccRCC. In this study, we report a functional role for PTTG1 in ccRCC tumorigenesis.
  PTTG1 was amplified in ccRCC, overexpressed in tumor tissue, and associated with
  high-grade tumor cells and poor patient prognosis. In preclinical models, PTTG1
  ablation reduced tumorigenesis and invasion. An analysis of gene expression affected
  by PTTG1 indicated an association with invasive and metastatic disease. PTTG1-dependent
  expression of the RhoGEF proto-oncogene ECT2 was observed in a number of ccRCC cell
  lines. Moreover, ECT2 expression correlated with PTTG1 expression and poor clinical
  features. Together, our findings reveal features of PTTG1 that are consistent with
  its identification of an oncogene amplified on chromsome 5q in ccRCC, where it may
  offer a novel therapeutic target of pathologic significance in this disease.
