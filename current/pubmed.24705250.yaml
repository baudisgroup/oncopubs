abstract: Pediatric midline high-grade astrocytomas mHGAs are incurable with few treatment
  targets identified. Most tumors harbor mutations encoding p.Lys27Met in histone
  H3 variants. In 40 treatment-naive mHGAs, 39 analyzed by whole-exome sequencing,
  we find additional somatic mutations specific to tumor location. Gain-of-function
  mutations in ACVR1 occur in tumors of the pons in conjunction with histone H3.1
  p.Lys27Met substitution, whereas FGFR1 mutations or fusions occur in thalamic tumors
  associated with histone H3.3 p.Lys27Met substitution. Hyperactivation of the bone
  morphogenetic protein BMP -ACVR1 developmental pathway in mHGAs harboring ACVR1
  mutations led to increased levels of phosphorylated SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 and upregulation
  of BMP downstream early-response genes in tumor cells. Global DNA methylation profiles
  were significantly associated with the p.Lys27Met alteration, regardless of the
  mutant histone H3 variant and irrespective of tumor location, supporting the role
  of this substitution in driving the epigenetic phenotype. This work considerably
  expands the number of potential treatment targets and further justifies pretreatment
  biopsy in pediatric mHGA as a means to orient therapeutic efforts in this disease.
