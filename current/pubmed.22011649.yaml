abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC is characterized by a multitude
  of genetic aberrations with unknown clinical impact. In this study, we aimed to
  identify gene copy number changes that correlate with clinical outcome in NSCLC.
  To maximize the chance to identify clinically relevant events, we applied a strategy
  involving two prognostically extreme patient groups. METHODS: Short-term lt 20 month
  n 53 and long-term survivors 58 month n 47 were selected from a clinically well-characterized
  NSCLC patient cohort with available fresh frozen tumor specimens. The samples were
  analyzed using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism array technology to
  assess gene copy number variations and array-based gene expression profiling. The
  molecular data were combined with information on clinical parameters. RESULTS: Genetic
  aberrations were strongly associated with tumor histology. In adenocarcinoma n 50
  , gene copy number gains on chromosome 8q21-q24.3 177 genes were more frequent in
  long-term than in short-term survivors. In squamous cell carcinoma n 28 , gains
  on chromosome 14q23.1-24.3 133 genes were associated with shorter survival, whereas
  losses in a neighboring region, 14q31.1-32.33 110 genes , correlated with favorable
  outcome. In accordance with copy number gains and losses, messenger RNA expression
  levels of corresponding genes were increased or decreased, respectively. CONCLUSION:
  Comprehensive tumor profiling permits the integration of genomic, histologic, and
  clinical data. We identified gene copy number gains and losses, with corresponding
  changes in messenger RNA levels that were associated with prognosis in adenocarcinoma
  and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.'
