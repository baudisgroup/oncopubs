abstract: Lineage-survival oncogenes are activated by somatic DNA alterations in cancers
  arising from the cell lineages in which these genes play a role in normal development.
  Here we show that a peak of genomic amplification on chromosome 3q26.33 found in
  squamous cell carcinomas SCCs of the lung and esophagus contains the transcription
  factor gene SOX2, which is mutated in hereditary human esophageal malformations,
  is necessary for normal esophageal squamous development, promotes differentiation
  and proliferation of basal tracheal cells and cooperates in induction of pluripotent
  stem cells. SOX2 expression is required for proliferation and anchorage-independent
  growth of lung and esophageal cell lines, as shown by RNA interference experiments.
  Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOX2 here cooperated with FOXE1 or FGFR2 to transform
  immortalized tracheobronchial epithelial cells. SOX2-driven tumors show expression
  of markers of both squamous differentiation and pluripotency. These characteristics
  identify SOX2 as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung and esophageal SCC.
