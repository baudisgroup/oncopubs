abstract: Multiple biopsies of normal breast tissue from 10 BRCA1 mutation carriers
  have been analyzed using array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Normal breast
  tissue from five age-matched control subjects without a family history of breast
  cancer was included for reference purposes. We repeatedly found multiple low copy
  number aberrations at a significantly higher frequency in histopathologically normal
  tissue from BRCA1 mutation carriers than in normal control tissue. Some of these
  aberrations were similar across samples from different patients and linked to biological
  functions such as transcriptional regulation and DNA binding. We also observed a
  high degree of genomic heterogeneity between samples from the same patient, suggestive
  of tissue heterogeneity and etiological clonality in the breast epithelium. We show
  that neither loss of heterozygosity nor promoter methylation of the wild-type BRCA1
  allele is the predominant mechanistic origin of the observed genomic instability.
  Instead, we propose that haploinsufficiency of BRCA1 might be the underlying cause
  responsible for initiation of breast cancer in these predisposed women, making cells
  vulnerable to mitotic recombination. We also propose that loss of ERalpha expression
  is preceded by genetic instability in the initiation of BRCA1-dependent tumorigenesis,
  indicating that the breast epithelium of BRCA1 mutation carriers may initially be
  estrogen-responsive. Our results imply that genomic instability instigated by BRCA1
  haploinsufficiency may be required for breast cancer initiation in BRCA1 mutation
  carriers. Finding molecular markers of tumor initiation and progression, for the
  potential use in early disease detection, may be of great clinical importance for
  the improved management of at-risk women.
