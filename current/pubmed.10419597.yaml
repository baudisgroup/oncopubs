abstract: Four low-grade oligodendrogliomas, nine anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and
  two mixed oligoastrocytomas were investigated for chromosomal aberrations by comparative
  genomic hybridization on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. The most
  frequent losses observed involved 1p, 9p, 10pq, 14q, 16p, 19q, while the most frequent
  gains were seen on 7pq, 11pq, 17p, 19pq, and Xp. In one oligodendroglioma, a highly
  specific amplification of 1q32.1 was seen. The frequent losses of 14q have not been
  reported previously. In the two cases of mixed oligoastrocytomas multiple gains
  and losses were found that did not show a clear overlap with the alterations found
  in the pure oligodendrogliomas.
