abstract: Ollier disease is a rare, non-hereditary disorder which is characterized
  by the presence of multiple enchondromas ECs , benign cartilaginous neoplasms arising
  within the medulla of the bone, with an asymmetric distribution. The risk of malignant
  transformation towards central chondrosarcoma CS is increased up to 35 . The aetiology
  of Ollier disease is unknown.
