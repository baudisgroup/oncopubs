abstract: Gene-modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells HSC can provide ample
  clinical benefits to subjects suffering from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease
  X-CGD , a rare inherited immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent, often life-threatening
  bacterial and fungal infections. Here we report on the molecular and cellular events
  observed in two young adults with X-CGD treated by gene therapy in 2004. After the
  initial resolution of bacterial and fungal infections, both subjects showed silencing
  of transgene expression due to methylation of the viral promoter, and myelodysplasia
  with monosomy 7 as a result of insertional activation of ecotropic viral integration
  site 1 EVI1 . One subject died from overwhelming sepsis 27 months after gene therapy,
  whereas a second subject underwent an allogeneic HSC transplantation. Our data show
  that forced overexpression of EVI1 in human cells disrupts normal centrosome duplication,
  linking EVI1 activation to the development of genomic instability, monosomy 7 and
  clonal progression toward myelodysplasia.
