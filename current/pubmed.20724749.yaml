abstract: Application of array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH has allowed
  an unprecedented high-resolution analysis of cancer genomes. We developed a custom
  genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray interrogating 493 genes involved in hematological
  disorders. We analyzed 55 patients with hematological neoplasms by using this microarray.
  In 33 patients with apparent normal conventional cytogenetic analysis, aneuploidy
  or isochromosomes were detected in 12 4 of 33 of the patients by aCGH. The chromosomal
  changes included trisomy of chromosomes 10, 14, and 15, tetrasomy 11, and isochromosome
  17q. In 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were initially investigated
  by using a panel of standard fluorescence in situ hybridization probes, additional
  copy number changes that were not interrogated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH panel were detected in 47 8 of 17 of the patients by aCGH. Important copy number
  changes included gain on 2p16 involving REL and BCL11A genes, rearrangements of
  chromosomes 8 and 15, and trisomy of chromosomes 19 and 22. In five patients with
  known abnormal karyotypes, aCGH identified the origin of two marker chromosomes
  and detected microdeletions at five breakpoints involved in three apparent balanced
  translocations. Our results suggest that a subset of potentially significant genomic
  alterations is missed by the currently available cytogenetic techniques. This pilot
  study clearly demonstrates high sensitivity of oligonucleotide aCGH for potential
  use in diagnosis and follow-up in patients with hematological neoplasms.
