abstract: Focal atrophy is presumed to be an indirect forerunner of prostate cancer.
  The aim of this study was to examine genetic alterations in prostate epithelia deriving
  from atrophic areas and compare these findings with those of cells deriving from
  paired prostate cancer in the same patient.
