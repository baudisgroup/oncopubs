abstract: Overall, pediatric high-grade glioma pHGG has a poor prognosis, in part
  due to the lack of understanding of the underlying biology. High-resolution 244
  K oligo array comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to analyze DNA from
  38 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded predominantly pretreatment pHGG samples, including
  13 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas DIPGs . The patterns of gains and losses were
  distinct from those seen in HGG arising in adults. In particular, we found 1q gain
  in up to 27 of our cohort compared with 9 reported in adults. A total of 13 had
  a balanced genetic profile with no large-scale copy number alterations. Homozygous
  loss at 8p12 was seen in 6 of 38 16 cases of pHGG. This novel deletion, which includes
  the ADAM3A gene, was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR qPCR . Loss of CDKN2A
  CDKN2B in 4 of 38 10 samples by oligo array CGH was confirmed by fluorescent in
  situ hybridization on tissue microarrays and was restricted to supratentorial tumors.
  Only 50 of supratentorial tumors were positive for CDKN2B expression by immunohistochemistry
  IHC , while 75 of infratentorial tumors were positive for CDKN2B expression P 0.03
  . Amplification of the 4q11-13 region was detected in 8 of cases and included PDGFRA
  and KIT, and subsequent qPCR analysis was consistent with the amplification of PDGFRA.
  MYCN amplification was seen in 5 of samples being significantly associated with
  anaplastic astrocytomas P 0.03 . Overall, DIPG shared similar spectrum of changes
  to supratentorial HGG with some notable differences, including high-frequency loss
  of 17p and 14q and lack of CDKN2A CDKN2B deletion. Informative genetic data providing
  insight into the underlying biology and potential therapeutic possibilities can
  be generated from archival tissue and typically small biopsies from DIPG. Our findings
  highlight the importance of obtaining pretreatment samples.
