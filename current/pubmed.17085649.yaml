abstract: The genomic instability in colon cancer can be divided into at least two
  major types, microsatellite instability MSI or chromosomal instability CIN . Although
  initially felt to be mutually exclusive, recent evidence suggests that there may
  be overlap between the two. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal alterations
  at high resolution in sporadic colon cancers with high-level microsatellite instability
  MSI-H and to compare them to those present in a set of matched microsatellite stable
  MSS tumors.
