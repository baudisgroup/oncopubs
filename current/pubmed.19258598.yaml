abstract: Unique and shared cytogenetic abnormalities have been documented for marginal
  zone lymphomas MZLs arising at different sites. Recently, homozygous deletions of
  the chromosomal band 6q23, involving the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein
  3 TNFAIP3, A20 gene, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, were described in ocular
  adnexal MZL, suggesting a role for A20 as a tumor suppressor in this disease. Here,
  we investigated inactivation of A20 by DNA mutations or deletions in a panel of
  extranodal MZL EMZL , nodal MZL NMZL , and splenic MZL SMZL . Inactivating mutations
  encoding truncated A20 proteins were identified in 6 19 of 32 MZLs, including 2
  18 of 11 EMZLs, 3 33 of 9 NMZLs, and 1 8 of 12 SMZLs. Two additional unmutated nonsplenic
  MZLs also showed monoallelic or biallelic A20 deletions by fluorescent in situ hybridization
  FISH and or SNP-arrays. Thus, A20 inactivation by either somatic mutation and or
  deletion represents a common genetic aberration across all MZL subtypes, which may
  contribute to lymphomagenesis by inducing constitutive NF-kappaB activation.
