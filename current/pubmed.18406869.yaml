abstract: Wilms tumor is the fourth most common malignancy of childhood its pathogenesis,
  however, remains largely unknown. With advancements in cytogenetic techniques, such
  as array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH , there is new hope for uncovering
  small chromosomal microdeletions or microduplications that may contribute to our
  understanding of Wilms tumor. We performed aCGH on 10 samples of Wilms tumor with
  normal conventional cytogenetic and chromosomal CGH findings. Array CGH revealed
  abnormalities in 3 of the 10 samples, including microdeletions 2q37.1, 7q31 approximately
  q32, and 11q22.3 , microduplication 18q21.1 , and gains and losses of larger chromosomal
  areas 1q and 7q gain and loss of 7p, 11q, 14q, and 16q . Fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH analysis confirmed the abnormalities and revealed the majority of them existed
  only in a proportion cells amp gt or 30 of cells . We also performed aCGH on three
  samples of Wilms tumor with previously identified translocations between chromosomes
  1 and 16, to determine the breakpoints. The breakpoints were seen in the pericentromeric
  regions of both chromosomes. Array CGH is useful for identifying submicroscopic
  changes in Wilms tumor and is more sensitive for detecting clonal abnormalities
  than conventional methods.
