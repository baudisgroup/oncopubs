abstract: To investigate the genetic and epigenetic landscape of hypodiploid (<45
  chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  Single nucleotide polymorphism
  array, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and methylation array analyses were
  performed on eleven hypodiploid ALL cases.  In line with previous studies, mutations
  in IKZF3 and FLT3 were detected in near-haploid (25-30 chromosomes) cases. Low hypodiploidy
  (31-39 chromosomes) was associated with somatic TP53 mutations. Notably, mutations
  of this gene were also found in 3/3 high hypodiploid (40-44 chromosomes) cases,
  suggesting that the mutational patterns are similar in low hypodiploid and high
  hypodiploid ALL. The high hypodiploid ALLs frequently displayed substantial cell-to-cell
  variability in chromosomal content, indicative of chromosomal instability; a rare
  phenomenon in ALL. Gene expression analysis showed that genes on heterodisomic chromosomes
  were more highly expressed in hypodiploid cases. Cases clustered according to hypodiploid
  subtype in the unsupervised methylation analyses, but there was no association between
  chromosomal copy number and methylation levels. A comparison between samples obtained
  at diagnosis and relapse showed that the relapse did not arise from the major diagnostic
  clone in 3/4 cases.  Taken together, our data support the conclusion that near-haploid
  and low hypodiploid ALL are different with regard to mutational profiles and also
  suggest that ALL cases with high hypodiploidy may harbor chromosomal instability.
