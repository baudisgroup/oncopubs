abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH studies have demonstrated a high incidence
  of chromosomal imbalances in non-Hodgkins lymphoma. However, the information on
  the genomic imbalances in Burkitts Lymphoma BL is scanty. Conventional cytogenetics
  was performed in 34 cases, and long-distance PCR for t 8 14 was performed in 18
  cases. A total of 170 changes were present with a median of four changes per case
  range 1-22 . Gains of chromosomal material 143 were more frequent than amplifications
  5 or losses 22 . The most frequent aberrations were gains on chromosomes 12q 26
  , Xq 22 , 22q 20 , 20q 17 and 9q 15 . Losses predominantly involved chromosomes
  13q 17 and 4q 9 . High-level amplifications were present in the regions 1q23-31
  three cases , 6p12-p25 and 8p22-p23. Upon comparing BL vs Burkitts cell leukemia
  BCL , the latter had more changes mean 4.3 - 2.2 than BL mean 2.7 - 3.2 . In addition,
  BCL cases showed more frequently gains on 8q, 9q, 14q, 20q, and 20q, 9q, 8q and
  14q, as well as losses on 13q and 4q. Concerning outcome, the presence of abnormalities
  on 1q ascertained either by cytogenetics or by CGH , and imbalances on 7q P 0.01
  were associated with a short survival.
