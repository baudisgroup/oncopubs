abstract: To clarify the genetic pathway s involved in the development and progression
  of oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC , as well as the relationship between genetic
  aberrations and biological characteristics of OSCC tumours, comparative genomic
  hybridization was used to analyse genetic alterations in both primary OSCCs and
  adjacent dysplastic lesions of the same biopsy specimens from 35 patients. Gain
  of 8q22-23 was the most frequent alteration in both OSCC and mild dysplasia, and
  was considered the earliest event in the process of oral tumourigenesis. The average
  number of DNA sequence copy number aberrations DSCNAs increased with progression
  from mild dysplasia to invasive carcinoma r 0.737, n 70, p amp lt 0.001 . OSCC samples
  were classified as having a large or small number of DSCNAs OSCC-L, 21.4 - 4.7 DSCNAs
  or OSCC-S, 10.0 - 1.7 DSCNAs, respectively p amp lt 0.0001 . Gains of 3q26-qter,
  8q, 11q13, 14q, and 20q and losses of 4q, 5q12-22, 6q, 8p, 13q, and 18q22-qter were
  common to OSCC-L and OSCC-S. Gains of 5p15, 7p, 17q11-22, and 18p and losses of
  3p14-21, 4p, and 9p were detected exclusively in OSCC-L. The average number of DSCNAs
  depended on whether the samples showed OSCC- L or dysplasia plus OSCC-L, or showed
  OSCC-S or dysplasia plus OSCC-S p 0.001 . Gain of 5p15 and losses of 4p and 9p were
  detected even in dysplastic lesions adjacent to OSCC-L samples. Loss of 4p was associated
  with node metastasis by multivariate analysis p 0.013 . OSCC-L tumours were more
  often T3-T4 stage tumours than T1-T2 stage tumours p 0.03 . These findings suggest
  that two different types of OSCC, OSCC-L associated with high-stage cancer and OSCC-S
  associated with low-stage cancer, arise from different types of dysplasia via different
  genetic pathways.
