abstract: 'Identification of gene amplifications in human tumors is important for
  the understanding of tumorigenesis and may lead to discovery of diagnostic and prognostic
  markers. In this study, we used a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH technique, combined with conventional CGH, to identify gene amplifications in
  43 tumors including eight pulmonary artery intimal sarcomas and 35 adrenocortical
  tumors. Conventional CGH revealed gains or amplifications of 12q13-q15 in six sarcomas
  and in two adrenocortical carcinomas. Using microarrays, we demonstrated that, among
  genes located on 12q13-q15, SAS CDK4 were amplified in six sarcomas, and MDM2 and
  GLI in five and four sarcomas, respectively. The two adrenocortical tumors showed
  coamplifications of SAS CDK4 and MDM2. Furthermore, PDGFRA located on 4q12 amplification
  was identified in five sarcomas. Our data demonstrate: 1 amplifications of SAS CDK4,
  MDM2, GLI, and PDGFRA are strongly associated with the tumorigenesis of pulmonary
  artery intimal sarcomas, whereas SAS CDK4 and MDM2 coamplification may contribute
  to the progression of adrenocortical tumors 2 microarray-based CGH is a useful tool
  for simultaneous detection of multiple gene amplifications, with a high sensitivity
  and resolution compared to that of conventional CGH.'
