abstract: Patients with stage IV neuroblastoma over the age of 500 days without MYCN
  amplification have a survival rate of amp lt 30 and there are currently no reliable
  means of predicting which of these patients will survive or succumb to the disease.
  The goal of this study is to develop a DNA copy number-based prognostic profile
  for these patients.
