abstract: Data from experimental hepatocarcinogenesis and recent studies in humans
  have suggested that the emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is a stepwise
  process. However, despite abundant experimental data, the precise molecular mechanisms
  and genetic alterations involved in human liver carcinogenesis are still unclear.
  Comparative genomic hybridization was used to analyze 26 hepatocellular nodules
  obtained from patients undergoing liver transplantation or surgical resection for
  HCC. According to the criteria proposed by the International Working Party, 16 nodules
  were classified as multiacinar regenerative nodules MRN , 4 as low-grade dysplastic
  nodules LG-DN , and 6 as high-grade dysplastic nodules HG-DN . Our aim was to investigate
  the possible genetic differences between MRN, LG-DN, and HG-DN. The whole group
  of nodules showed only a few aberrations mean 1.1 case , without any significant
  pattern. This finding is comparable to what happens in non-neoplastic tissue. On
  the contrary, in three of six HG-DN, we found deletions of 8p and gains of 1q. LG-DN
  and MRN did not show these chromosomal imbalances. These results confirm the important
  role of allelic losses on 8p as well as of gains of 1q in HCC. We conclude that
  the genes that are important in early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis are probably
  located on these chromosomal arms.
