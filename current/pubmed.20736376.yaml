abstract: Multiple myeloma MM is a plasma cell malignancy of the bone marrow, which
  evolves from a premalignant stage called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
  MGUS . In some patients, an intermediate stage referred to as smoldering multiple
  myeloma SMM is clinically recognized, with the full-bore malignancy termed MM. We
  conducted a study to assess differential CpG methylation at 1,500 genic loci during
  MM progression and profiled CD138 plasma cells from MGUS, SMM, and MM specimens
  human myeloma cell lines and normal plasma cell NPC samples. We showed that the
  number of differentially methylated loci DML increased with tumor grade, and the
  vast majority were due to hypomethylation. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed
  samples that coclustered tightly with NPC. These cases, referred to as amp quot
  normal-like, amp quot contained significantly fewer DML when compared with their
  non-normal-like counterparts and displayed overall methylation levels resembling
  NPC. This study represents one of the first methylome interrogation studies in MM
  and points toward global hypomethylation at genic CpG loci as an important and early
  mechanism driving myelomagenesis. Determining the set of critical genes and pathways
  based on the myeloma methylome is expected to lead to an improved understanding
  of biological mechanisms involved in myelomagenesis.
