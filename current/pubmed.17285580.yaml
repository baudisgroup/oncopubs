abstract: 'Deletions on chromosomes 1p and 19q are associated with favorable prognosis
  in patients with oligodendroglial tumors. The aim of our study was to identify additional
  genomic aberrations linked to patient survival. We performed a genome-wide screen
  for genomic imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization on tumors from 70 patients,
  including 40 oligodendrogliomas, 30 oligoastrocytomas 21 WHO grade II tumors, 49
  WHO grade III tumors . Data were correlated with overall patient survival OS, median
  follow-up: 5.8 years . The most frequent aberrations were losses on chromosome 19q
  64 , 1p 59 , 9p 26 , 4q 21 , 10q 19 , 18q 17 gains on 7q 24 , 19p 19 , 7p 17 . In
  univariate analyses, combined 1p 19q and 19q loss were significantly associated
  with longer OS, and gains on 7, 8q, 19q, 20, losses on 9p, 10, 18q, Xp with shorter
  OS. Multivariate analyses showed the most significant prognostic factors for OS
  of patients with any oligodendroglial tumor to be WHO grade odds ratio OR 8 , 7p
  gain OR 6 , 9p loss OR 3 for OS of patients with anaplastic tumors to be 7p gain
  OR 10 , 8q gain OR 5 , 18q loss OR 3 . Patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial
  tumors containing one or more prognostically unfavorable genomic aberration had
  a poor outcome independent of the 1p 19q status. In summary, we identified several
  independent genomic markers of shorter survival in patients with oligodendroglial
  tumors. Thus, molecular diagnostic testing, which is usually restricted to 1p 19q
  deletion analysis, may need to be refined by additionally assessing the prognostically
  unfavorable genomic aberrations identified.'
