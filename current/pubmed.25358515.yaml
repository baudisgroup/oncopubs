abstract: Several hundred clinical trials currently explore the role of circulating
  tumor cell (CTC) analysis for therapy decisions, but assays are lacking for comprehensive
  molecular characterization of CTCs with diagnostic precision. We therefore combined
  a workflow for enrichment and isolation of pure CTCs with a non-random whole genome
  amplification method for single cells and applied it to 510 single CTCs and 189
  leukocytes of 66 CTC-positive breast cancer patients. We defined a genome integrity
  index (GII) to identify single cells suited for molecular characterization by different
  molecular assays, such as diagnostic profiling of point mutations, gene amplifications
  and whole genomes of single cells. The reliability of >ï¿½90% for successful molecular
  analysis of high-quality clinical samples selected by the GII enabled assessing
  the molecular heterogeneity of single CTCs of metastatic breast cancer patients.
  We readily identified genomic disparity of potentially high relevance between primary
  tumors and CTCs. Microheterogeneity analysis among individual CTCs uncovered pre-existing
  cells resistant to ERBB2-targeted therapies suggesting ongoing microevolution at
  late-stage disease whose exploration may provide essential information for personalized
  treatment decisions and shed light into mechanisms of acquired drug resistance.
