abstract: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women older than 35
  years in Mexico. In this study, we used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to
  analyze sporadic breast cancers at stages II and III from untreated patients. We
  obtained 4.1 chromosomal alterations per sample, less than in previous reports.
  We identified a small region in Xq27 with high-level amplification in 3 of 16 samples.
  This amplification has been reported only in pancreatic and gastric cancer cell
  lines and in testis tumors in addition, this amplification had been reported in
  one primary breast cancer, but in a more extended region that we identified. We
  also identified a loss in 2p13, not previously reported in this neoplasia. The most
  frequent alterations were amplifications in 4q, 5q, 8q, 12p, and 13q and losses
  in 1p, 8p, 16p, 19q, and Xp. CGH provides data for better understanding of molecular
  events in this neoplasia.
