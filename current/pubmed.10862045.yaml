abstract: We have studied a series of 20 primary retinoblastomas by karyotypic analysis
  and comparative genomic hybridization CGH , to perform an exhaustive evaluation
  of chromosome imbalances in this tumor. In addition, 4 tumors were studied by CGH
  only. On the whole, CGH results were largely in agreement with those of karyotypic
  analysis and with known cytogenetic data. The most frequent imbalances were 6p 13
  24 cases , 1q 12 24 , -16 -16q 11 24 , and 2p 9 24 . Recurrent high-level amplifications
  were observed in 2p23-25 and 1q21. Amplification of 2p23-25, present in 4 cases
  among which 3 showed double-minute chromosomes, was related to MYCN amplification,
  as demonstrated by FISH and PCR. No evident correlation was found in this small
  series between any of the imbalances identified and either the differentiation or
  the histoprognostic risk.
