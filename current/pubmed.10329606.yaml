abstract: The genetic changes leading to thyroid cancer are poorly characterized.
  We studied DNA copy number changes by comparative genomic hybridization CGH in 69
  primary thyroid carcinomas. In papillary carcinoma, DNA copy number changes were
  rare 3 of 26, 12 . The changes were all gains, and they were associated with old
  age P 0.01 and the presence of cervical lymph node metastases at presentation P
  0.08 . DNA copy number changes were much more frequent in follicular carcinoma 16
  of 20, 80 than in papillary carcinoma P amp lt 0.0001 , and follicular carcinomas
  had more often deletions 13 20 versus 0 26, P amp lt 0.0001 . Loss of chromosome
  22 was common in follicular carcinoma n 7, 35 , it was more often seen in widely
  invasive than in minimally invasive follicular carcinoma 54 versus 0 , P 0.04 ,
  and it was associated with old age at presentation P 0.01 . In three of the four
  patients with follicular carcinoma who died of cancer, the tumor had loss of chromosome
  22. DNA copy number changes were found in 5 50 of the 10 medullary carcinomas studied.
  Four of these five carcinomas had deletions, and in two of them there was deletion
  of chromosome 22. Eleven 85 of the thirteen anaplastic carcinomas investigated had
  DNA copy number changes, of which five had deletions, and one had deletion of chromosome
  22. The most common gains in anaplastic carcinoma were in chromosomes 7p p22-pter,
  31 , 8q q22-qter, 23 , and 9q q34-qter, 23 . We conclude that DNA copy number changes
  are frequent in follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma but rare
  in papillary carcinoma when studied by CGH. Loss of chromosome 22 is particularly
  common in follicular carcinoma, and it is associated with the widely invasive type.
