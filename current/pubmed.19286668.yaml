abstract: 'Altered gene expression in tumors can be caused by copy number alterations
  to DNA or mutation affecting coding or regulatory regions of genes. However, epigenetic
  events may also influence gene expression. Malignant cells can show major disruptions
  in DNA methylation profiles, which are manifested as aberrant hypermethylation or
  as hypomethylation of gene promoters, as well as global genomic hypomethylation.
  In this study we performed integrative whole-genome analysis of DNA copy number,
  promoter methylation and gene expression using 10 osteosarcomas. We identified significant
  changes including: hypomethylation, gain, and overexpression of histone cluster
  2 genes at chromosome 1q21.1-q21.3 loss of chromosome 8p21.2-p21.3 and underexpression
  of DOCK5 and TNFRSF10A D genes and amplification-related overexpression of RUNX2
  at chromosome 6p12.3-p21.1. Amplification and overexpression of RUNX2 could disrupt
  G2 M cell cycle checkpoints, and downstream osteosarcoma-specific changes, such
  as failure of bone differentiation and genomic polyploidization. Failure of DOCK5-signaling,
  together with p53 and TNFRSF10A D-related cell cycle and death pathways, may play
  a critical role in abrogating apoptosis. Our analyses show that the RUNX2 interactome
  may be constitutively activated in osteosarcoma, and that the downstream intracellular
  pathways are strongly associated with the regulation of osteoblast differentiation
  and control of cell cycle and apoptosis in osteosarcoma.'
