abstract: We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to measure genomic
  copy number alterations CNAs in 42 neuroblastoma cell lines with known 1p36.3, 2p24
  MYCN , 11q23, and 17q23 allelic status. All cell lines showed CNAs, with an average
  of 22.0 of the genome of each sample showing evidence of gain 11.6 or loss 10.4
  . MYCN amplification was detected in 81 of cell lines, but other regions with high-level
  genomic amplification were observed only rarely. Gain of 17q material was present
  in 75 of the samples, and four discrete genomic regions at 17q23.2-17q25.3 were
  defined. Novel regions of gain were identified, including a 2.6-Mb subtelomeric
  region at 5p that includes the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene TERT , which
  was found in 45 of the cell lines. Hemizygous deletions were noted at 1p36.23-1p36.32
  and 11q23.3-11q25 in 60 and 36 , respectively, of the samples, with other frequent
  amp gt 25 regions of deletion localized to 1p32.1, 3p21.31-3p22.1, 5q35.2-5q35.3,
  7q31.2, 7q34, 9q22.3-9q24.1, 10q26.11-10q26.12, 16q23.1-16q24.3, 18q21.32-18q23,
  and 20p11.21-20p11.23. A smallest region of overlap SRO for CNAs was mapped across
  all experiments and in each case was consistent with or refined the published data.
  A single cell line showed a homozygous deletion at 3p22.3, which was verified, and
  this location was refined by FISH and PCR. There was outstanding concordance of
  aCGH with PCR-based CNA detection methods. Several potential cooperating loci were
  identified, including deletion of 11q23-25, which was highly associated with both
  regional gain and loss at multiple chromosomal loci but was inversely correlated
  with the deletion of 1p36. Taking all of this together indicates that aCGH can accurately
  measure CNAs in the neuroblastoma genome and facilitate gene discovery efforts by
  high-throughput refinement of candidate loci.
