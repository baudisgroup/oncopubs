abstract: Flat adenomas are flat or slightly elevated dysplastic lesions of the colorectal
  mucosa, mostly with a tubular architecture. Compared with polypoid adenomas of similar
  size, flat adenomas show a higher frequency of high-grade dysplasia and rapid submucosal
  invasion. The aim of this study was to survey whether flat colorectal lesions differ
  in their pattern of chromosomal aberrations from their polypoid counterparts. Six
  flat adenomas and 12 flat carcinomas were analysed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH and the pattern of chromosomal aberrations was compared with a previously published
  series of 112 polypoid adenomas and 82 polypoid carcinomas. In addition, multiplex
  ligation-dependent probe amplification MLPA for identifying DNA copy number changes
  of 25 individual genes on chromosome 20 was performed on 14 flat and 15 polypoid
  tumours. With CGH, flat adenomas showed on average 1.8 gains range 1-4 and 3.2 losses
  range 0-4 , and the flat carcinomas 4.5 gains range 0-8 and 3.5 losses range 1-6
  . In both adenomas and carcinomas, high frequencies of 20q gain 83 and 92 , respectively
  and 18q loss 83 and 92 , respectively were found. This correlation between 20q gain
  and 18q loss had previously been observed in a subgroup of polypoid colorectal tumours.
  Both flat and polypoid colorectal tumours with 20q gains by CGH showed similar patterns
  of copy number ratios for the individual genes tested. TOP1, BCL2L1, and E2F1 had
  median copy number ratios of 2 or higher, while ZNF217 had a ratio around 3. In
  conclusion, flat adenomas and carcinomas of the large intestine show a similar pattern
  of chromosomal aberrations to that observed in a specific subgroup of polypoid lesions.
  The transcription factor ZNF217 is an important candidate for driving the 20q gain.
