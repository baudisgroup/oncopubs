abstract: 'Information on chromosomal aberrations in cutaneous T cell lymphomas CTCL
  , is scarce. In this study, comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to analyze
  chromosomal imbalances CI in 32 patients with CTCL. CI were detected in 21 patients
  66 . Euchromatic loss dim was localized most frequently amp gt 16 at the chromosomal
  regions 17p 28 , 13q 25 , 10q 16 , and 6q 19 , and gain of chromatin enh at 7 25
  , 8q 25 , and 17q 16 . The pattern dim6q-enh7-enh8-dim13 was the most frequent combination
  of CI. The number of aberrations per tumor sample varied between 0 and 19 and correlated
  with clinical tumor stages: from none in stage Ia to 8.75 -1.8 mean -SEM in stage
  IVa. CI occurred more frequently in aggressive subtypes 9.33 -2.16 than in indolent
  2.88 -0.8 subtypes. A high number of CI amp gt 5 was associated with shorter survival.
  Gain of chromatin in 8q and loss of 6q and 13q correlated with a significantly shorter
  survival, whereas the most frequently observed aberrations loss in 17p and gain
  in 7 did not influence the prognosis. In summary, CGH analysis revealed a characteristic
  pattern of recurring chromosomal gains and losses in CTCL. The association of the
  imbalances with the clinical course of the disease suggests that genes encoded at
  these loci may influence tumor development and progression.'
