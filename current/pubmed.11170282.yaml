abstract: To identify genetic alterations associated with the development and progression
  of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC , 57 tumors were analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . In 47 cases, chromosomal imbalances were found. Several recurrent
  chromosomal abnormalities were identified in the present study. The most frequently
  detected chromosomal gains involved chromosome arms 12q 24 cases, 51 , 4q 17 cases,
  36 , 3q 16 cases, 34 , 1q 15 cases, 32 , and 18q 15 cases, 32 . Common regions of
  gain involved 12q13--q15, 4q12--q21, and 3q21--q26. High-copy-number increases of
  chromosomal materials were detected in four chromosomal regions, 3q21--q26.2, 4p12--q21,
  8p, and 12q14--q15. The most frequently detected loss of chromosomal materials involved
  chromosome arms 16q 26 cases, 55 , 14q 21 cases, 45 , 1p 20 cases, 43 , 3p 20 cases,
  43 , 16p 19 cases, 40 , 11q 17 cases, 36 , and 19p 16 cases, 34 . The most common
  regions of loss involved 14q24--qter, 1pter--p36.1, 3p22--p21.3, 11q21--qter, and
  the distal region of 19p. Genomic alterations detected by CGH were compared and
  found to be largely consistent with those identified in banding analysis and loss
  of heterozygosity studies. However, several previously unrecognized recurrent alterations
  were also identified in the present study, including gain of 4q and 18q, and loss
  of 16q, 14q, and 19p. In addition, gain of 1q, 8q, 18q, and loss of 9q showed a
  statistically significant association with advanced clinical stages P amp lt 0.05
  . Identification of recurrent sites of chromosomal gain and loss identify regions
  of the genome that may contain oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, respectively,
  which may be involved in the tumorigenesis of NPC. Published 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
