abstract: Ewing tumors are characterized by reciprocal translocations involving the
  EWS gene on 22q12 fused to ETS transcription-factor family members. Little is known
  about further aberrations contributing to tumor development and progression. Sixty-two
  frozen tumors with known EWS rearrangements 52 primary tumors, 10 relapses of ET
  patients registered in the EICESS protocol were analyzed by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . The median number of changes in 52 primary and 10 relapsed cases
  was 2.5 and 5.0 per tumor P 0.153 . Frequent abnormalities included gains of chromosomes
  8, 12, 20, and 1q and losses of 16q and 19q. Neither number nor type of aberration
  was associated with histology, tumor size, disease stage, tumor localization, or
  histologic tumor response to chemotherapy. Among the 52 primary tumors, 26 with
  Type I fusion EWS exon 7 to FLI1 exon 6 and 26 with other fusion types had a median
  of 2.0 and 3.0 aberrations per tumor, respectively P 0.031 . Combinations of gains
  of chromosomes 8 and 12, gains of chromosome 20, and either gains of 8q or 18q and
  losses of 16q and 17p frequently occurred. The cumulative overall survival OAS was
  different between 35 patients with amp lt 5 aberrations and 13 patients with amp
  gt or 5 aberrations P 0.009 . Univariate analysis showed that patients with gains
  of 1q, 2q, 12, and 20 or losses of 16q and 17p had significantly lower OAS than
  those without aberrations. By multivariate analysis, loss of 16q relative risk RR
  5.3 P 0.0006 was an independent prognostic factor.
