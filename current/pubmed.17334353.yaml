abstract: 'Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors of the breast. The pathologic
  grading of phyllodes tumors based on the aspect of the stromal component, is divided
  into 2 or 3 grades according to the system used. To determine whether genetic markers
  could be of use for improving the classification of phyllodes tumors and to provide
  a better knowledge of the genetic alterations in these tumors, we analyzed chromosomal
  changes detected by comparative genomic hybridization CGH in comparison with histological
  data, in a series of 30 cases. Recurrent chromosome imbalances were observed in
  55, 91 and 100 of benign, borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors, respectively.
  The mean number of chromosome changes was one in benign, six in borderline, and
  six in malignant phyllodes tumors. Most frequent genetic imbalances were 1q 12 30
  , -13q 7 30 , -6q 9 30 , 5 9 30 and -10p 8 30 . Gains of 1q, present in only one
  of nine benign tumors, were found in 11 21 51 borderline or malignant tumors. Losses
  of 13q have 13q14.2 as smallest region of overlap, suggesting that the RB1 gene
  could be the target of deletions. Amplifications of 12q14, involving the MDM2 locus,
  and of 8p24, involving the MYC gene, were observed in one case each. Borderline
  and malignant phyllodes tumors could not be differentiated on the basis of their
  genomic imbalances presence and number of chromosomal changes, presence of 1q gain
  and or 13q loss . Conversely, benign tumors could be significantly differentiated
  from the group composed of borderline and malignant tumors P amp lt 0.01 . This
  study reveals two distinct patterns of genomic imbalance in phyllodes tumors: benign,
  with none or a few chromosome changes and malignant, with numerous recurrent chromosomal
  changes, in particular 1q gain and 13q loss. Helpful additional pathological criteria
  for differentiating the two genetic groups of phyllodes tumors are the nuclear size
  and the mitotic rate.'
