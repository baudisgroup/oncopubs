abstract: The myelodysplastic syndromes MDS are a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders
  characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and a risk of transformation
  to acute myeloid leukemia AML . However, only approximately 50 of primary MDS patients
  show clonal cytogenetic aberrations. To determine whether high-resolution microarray
  analysis would reveal new or additional aberrations, we analyzed 35 samples derived
  from patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of MDS and abnormal karyotypes. We used
  a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray with targeted coverage of approximately
  1900 genes associated with hematologic and other cancers. Clinically relevant copy
  number aberrations CNAs were identified by microarray-based comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH in all samples range 1-31, median 5 . In 28 of 35 samples 80
  , aCGH revealed new cytogenetic aberrations not seen by karyotype or fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH . Furthermore, 132 cryptic aberrations  5 Mb were identified
  in 25 cases 71.4 including deletions of NF1, RUNX1, RASSF1, CCND1, TET2, DNMT3A,
  HRAS, PDGFRA and FIP1L1. Additionally, aCGH clarified known complex aberrations
  in 17 of 35 samples 48.6 . Finally, our results using whole-genome arrays with higher
  density coverage targeted to cancer features demonstrate the usefulness of arrays
  to identify rare and cryptic recurring imbalances that may prove to be significant
  in disease progression or transformation to AML and may improve the suitability
  or efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy.
