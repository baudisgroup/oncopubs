abstract: Cancers emerge from an ongoing Darwinian evolutionary process, often leading
  to multiple competing subclones within a single primary tumour. This evolutionary
  process culminates in the formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90% of
  cancer-related deaths. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known
  about the principles governing the dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs.
  Although the hypothesis that each metastasis originates from a single tumour cell
  is generally supported, recent studies using mouse models of cancer demonstrated
  the existence of polyclonal seeding from and interclonal cooperation between multiple
  subclones. Here we sought definitive evidence for the existence of polyclonal seeding
  in human malignancy and to establish the clonal relationship among different metastases
  in the context of androgen-deprived metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole-genome
  sequencing, we characterized multiple metastases arising from prostate tumours in
  ten patients. Integrated analyses of subclonal architecture revealed the patterns
  of metastatic spread in unprecedented detail. Metastasis-to-metastasis spread was
  found to be common, either through de novo monoclonal seeding of daughter metastases
  or, in five cases, through the transfer of multiple tumour clones between metastatic
  sites. Lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur as single events,
  whereas mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor signalling commonly involve
  multiple, convergent events in different metastases. Our results elucidate in detail
  the complex patterns of metastatic spread and further our understanding of the development
  of resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.
