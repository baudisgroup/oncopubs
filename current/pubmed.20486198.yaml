abstract: Detection of cytogenetic alterations in esophageal cancer EC . A total of
  40 cases of primary EC and their paired nearby nontumor tissues were collected.
  The comparative genomic hybridization CGH is the technique that brings out the gains
  and losses of chromosome fragments and was applied to determine the aberrations
  from the tissue DNA. In noncancer tissues, the gains were at 19p 5 40, 13 , 20q
  5 40, 13 , and losses at 9p 13 40, 33 , 2q 10 40, 25 , 12q 10 40, 25 , 13q 10 40,
  25 , 5q 9 40, 23 , 6q 9 40, 23 , 7q 9 40, 23 , and 8p 9 40, 23 . Two cases in nontumor
  tissues showed no CGH change. In the 40 cases of primary EC, the gains were at 8q
  10 40, 25 , 3q 9 40, 23 , 2q 7 40, 18 , and 13q 7 40, 18 , and the losses were at
  1q 8 40, 20 , 4q 8 40, 20 , 3p 7 40, 18 , 5q 7 40, 18 , and 18q 7 40, 18 in comparison
  with paired nearby noncancerous tissues. We found that the loss aberrations were
  on 1q, 2p, 3p, 5q, 6q, 9p, 11p, 15q, 16q, 18q, 21q and gains on 20p in both tumor
  and nontumor tissues nevertheless, -4p, -7q, -8p, -10q, -12q, -13q, -14q and 17p,
  19q, 22q were only found in nontumor tissues and 1q, 2pq, 3q, -4q, 4q, 5q, 7p, 8q,
  10q, 12q, 13q, 14q -17p, -19pq, -22q in EC. From these results, we suggest that
  most of the tissues near the cancer parts of EC may be considered as a precancerous
  region. The alteration between cancer and noncancer tissues may play a role in the
  development of EC.
