abstract: A rare subset of human immunodeficiency virus HIV lymphomas, known as primary
  effusion lymphomas PELs , are high-grade tumors carrying human herpes virus 8. Mechanisms
  postulated to contribute to lymphomagenesis include impaired immune surveillance,
  alterations in hemopoietic regulatory pathways due to expressed viral genes, and
  acquisition of genomic alterations in regions of the genome that contain regulatory
  genes. In PEL, limited information exists about the nature of genome-wide aberrations
  in these rare lymphomas.
