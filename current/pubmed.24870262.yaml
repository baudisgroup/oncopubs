abstract: Intratumoural heterogeneity ITH leads to regional biases of the mutational
  landscape in a single tumour and may influence the single biopsy-based clinical
  diagnosis and treatment decision. To evaluate the extent of ITH in unifocal prostate
  cancers PCAs , we analysed multiple regional biopsies from three PCAs, using whole-exome
  sequencing, DNA copy number and gene expression profiling analyses. A substantial
  level of ITH was identified, in that 0-61 and 18-71 of somatic variants were common
  or private, respectively, within a given cancer. The enhanced mutation detection
  rate in the combined sequencing dataset across intratumoural biopsies was demonstrated
  with respect to the total number of mutations identified in a given tumour. Allele
  frequencies of the mutations were positively correlated with the levels of intratumoural
  recurrence private lt shared lt common , but some common mutations showed low allele
  frequency, suggesting that not all were clonally fixed. Regional biases in the presentation
  of a well-known TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was noted in one PCA and the somatic mutation-
  and copy number-based phylogenetic relationships between intratumoural biopsies
  were largely concordant. Genes showing intratumoural expression variability were
  commonly enriched in the molecular function of eicosanoid metabolism and PCA-relevant
  clinical markers. Taken together, our analyses identified a substantial level of
  genetic ITH in unifocal PCAs at the mutation, copy number and expression levels,
  which should be taken into account for the identification of biomarkers in the clinical
  setting. Copyright c 2014 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published
