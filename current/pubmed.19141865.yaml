abstract: Acquired homozygosity in the form of segmental acquired uniparental disomy
  aUPD has been described in follicular lymphoma FL and is usually due to mitotic
  recombination. SNP array analysis was performed with the use of the Affymetrix 10K
  2.0 Gene-chip array on DNA from 185 diagnostic FL patients to assess the prognostic
  relevance of aUPD. Genetic abnormalities were detected in 118 65 of 182 patients.
  Number of abnormalities was predictive of outcome more than 3 abnormalities was
  associated with inferior overall survival OS P amp lt .03 . Sites of recurrent aUPD
  were detected on 6p n 25 , 16p n 22 , 12q n 17 , 1p36 n 14 , 10q n 8 , and 6q n
  8 . On multivariate analysis aUPD on 1p36 correlated with shorter OS P .05 . aUPD
  on 16p was predictive of transformation P .03 and correlated with poorer progression-free
  survival P .02 . aUPD is frequent at diagnosis of FL and affects probability of
  disease transformation and clinical outcome.
