abstract: Esophageal cancer is the fourth most prevalent malignancy in China. So far,
  the genetic events involved in esophageal cancer remain largely unknown. To identify
  chromosomal alterations in this disease, comparative genomic hybridization was performed
  on 25 primary tumors of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Results exhibited nonrandom
  copy number changes in chromosome DNA, with higher incidence in gain than in loss.
  The average gains and losses per patient were 7.76 and 4, respectively. The most
  common gains were 3q 20 25 , 1q 15 25 , 8q 15 25 , 20p 12 25 , 20q 11 25 , 5p 10
  25 , 15q 8 25 , and 9q 8 25 with two minimal amplification loci mapped to chromosomal
  regions of 8q24 2 cases and 11q13 7 cases . High-level amplification was observed
  at 3q 8 cases , 5p 4 cases , and 8q 4 cases . Losses at 3p 10 25 , 13q 8 25 , 18q
  7 25 , Xp 7 25 , 4 6 25 , 9p 6 25 , 14q 6 25 , 18p 6 25 , and 21q 6 25 were identified.
  Remarkably, ten cases showed both loss of the entire 3p and overrepresentation of
  almost the whole 3q. No significant differences in stage or grade of tumor were
  found for DNA copy number changes. The results provided candidate regions for potential
  oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes related to Chinese esophageal cancer, to which
  further molecular studies should be addressed.
