abstract: We demonstrate that comparative genomic hybridization CGH onto cDNA microarrays
  may be used to carry out genome-wide screens for regions of genetic loss, including
  homozygous complete deletions that may represent the possible location of tumour
  suppressor genes in human cancer. Screening of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP,
  PC3 and DU145 allowed the mapping of specific regions where genome copy number appeared
  altered and led to the identification of two novel regions of complete loss at 17q21.31
  500 kb spanning STAT3 and at 10q23.1 50-350 kb spanning SFTPA2 in the PC3 cell line.
