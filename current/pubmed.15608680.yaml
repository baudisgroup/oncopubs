abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is characterized by 11q13 chromosomal translocation
  and CCND1 overexpression, but additional genomic changes are also important for
  lymphomagenesis. To identify the genomic aberrations of MCL at higher resolutions,
  we analysed 29 patient samples and seven cell lines using array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH consisting of 2348 artificial chromosome clones,
  which cover the whole genome at a 1.3 mega base resolution. The incidence of identified
  genomic aberrations was generally higher than that determined with chromosomal CGH.
  The most frequent imbalances detected by array CGH were gains of chromosomes 3q26
  48 , 7p21 34 , 6p25 24 , 8q24 24 , 10p12 21 and 17q23 17 , and losses of chromosomes
  2p11 83 , 11q22 59 , 13q21 55 , 1p21-p22 52 , 13q34 52 , 9q22 45 , 17p13 45 , 9p21
  41 , 9p24 41 , 6q23-q24 38 , 1p36 31 , 8p23 34 , 10p14 31 , 19p13 28 , 5q21 21 ,
  22q12 21 , 1q42 17 and 2q13 17 . Our analyses also detected several novel recurrent
  regions of loss located at 1p36, 1q42.2-q43, 2p11.2, 2q13, 17p13.3 and 19p13.2-p13.3,
  as well as recurrent regions of homozygous loss such as 2p11 Ig kappa , 2q13 and
  9p21.3-p24.1 INK4a ARF . Of the latter, we investigated the 2q13 loss, which led
  to identification of homozygous deletions of the proapoptotic gene BIM. The high-resolution
  array CGH technology allowed for the precise identification of genomic aberrations
  and identification of BIM as a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene in MCL.
