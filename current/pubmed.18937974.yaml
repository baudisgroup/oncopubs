abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH , using oligo arrays with either
  44,000 or 105,000 oligonucleotides, was performed on granulocyte-derived DNA from
  71 patients with BCR-ABL-negative classic myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs : 32
  primary myelofibrosis PMF , 26 polycythemia vera PV and 13 essential thrombocythemia
  ET . Copy number changes CNCs were detected in 44 , 35 , and 15 of the cases with
  PMF, PV and ET, respectively. In ET and PMF, CNCs were more frequently detected
  in the presence of JAK2V617F 50 vs. 19 p 0.05 . Conventional chromosome analysis
  was obtained in 57 patients either at diagnosis or within 1 year of the array CGH
  study all 21 patients with PV and 11 with ET displayed normal cytogenetic findings
  despite the presence of CNCs in 29 and 18 , respectively. In PMF, the respective
  rates of CNCs and abnormal karyotype were 48 and 36 karyotypic abnormalities, including
  unbalanced translocations, were often detected by array CGH as chromosomal gains
  or losses. This preliminary report suggests a potential value for array CGH in terms
  of both clinical diagnostics and genomic research in MPNs.'
