abstract: Neuroblastoma is characterized by several distinct genetic alterations including
  MYCN amplification, chromosome 1p deletion and gain of chromosome 17. Although these
  alterations are thought to play a crucial role in oncogenesis, to date little is
  known about their underlying mechanisms. In order to more precisely document these
  genetic alterations, we have performed a combined study of 27 neuroblastoma cell
  lines using 24-color karyotyping 24-CK and comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  . 24-CK detected balanced translocations in 13 cases with recurrent involvement
  of chromosome 8. More importantly, 144 nonreciprocal translocations were observed
  in the 27 cell lines, with chromosome 1 as the most frequent recipient and chromosome
  17 the most frequent donor. Each cell line exhibited at least one unbalanced translocation
  involving 17q, with 14 cell lines demonstrating more than one such translocation.
  Other recurrent alterations were amplification of the 2p24 chromosome region, which
  encodes the MYCN oncogene, losses of 1p, 3p and 11q, and gains of 1q and 7. In most
  cases, CGH profiles were directly linked to the presence of unbalanced translocations
  with gain of the donor fragment and loss of the replaced region on the recipient
  chromosome. Strikingly, over 60 of the chromosome breakpoints mapped to early replicating
  chromosome bands, which represent around 13 of the genome. Altogether these data
  suggest that neuroblastoma is characterized by rearrangements that predominantly
  involve chromosome fragments replicating early in the S-phase.
