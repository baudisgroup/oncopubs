abstract: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor AT RT is a highly malignant central nervous
  system tumor often misdiagnosed as some other type of pediatric embryonal tumor,
  such as medulloblastoma MB . Distinguishing AT RT from primitive neuroectodermal
  tumor MB is of clinical significance, as the reported survival rate of patients
  with AT RT is much lower than that of patients with average-risk primitive neuroectodermal
  tumor MB. The diagnosis of AT RT currently relies primarily on the morphologic assessment
  and immunostaining of a few known markers, such as the lack of INI1 protein expression.
  Immunohistochemical staining of INI1 is considered very sensitive and is highly
  specific for the detection of INI1 genetic defects. Genetic studies have shown that
  deletion or mutation of the INI1 gene, which is located on 22q11.2, occurs in AT
  RT lesions. During our gene expression microarray analysis, we unexpectedly found
  a subgroup of AT RT patients still expressing INI1 mRNA, even though INI1 proteins
  were negative by immunohistochemistry in those cases. Direct DNA sequencing showed
  no INI1 sequence alternation in 3 of 4 AT RTs. Point mutation was found in only
  1 allele of the fourth case, which would result in a frameshift mutation and generate
  a new INI1 protein with an extra 100-aa tail. Global array comparative genomic hybridization
  analysis confirmed no aberration around the INI1 gene at 22q11.2. It also extended
  our knowledge on the chromosomal aberration situations in our series. This study
  reveals that a novel yet unidentified posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism s
  for INI1 protein synthesis exists in AT RT tumor cells.
