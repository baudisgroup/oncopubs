abstract: Male breast cancer MBC is a rare disease and little is known about its etiopathogenesis.
  Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH provides a method to quantitatively
  measure the changes of DNA copy number and to map them directly onto the complete
  linear genome sequences. The aim of this study was to investigate DNA imbalances
  by aCGH and compare them with a female breast cancer dataset.
