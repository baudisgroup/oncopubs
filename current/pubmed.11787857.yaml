abstract: Distinction of spitzoid malignant melanomas SMM from Spitz nevi may be difficult
  or even impossible on the basis of conventional histology. In this report, a patient
  suffering from a primary lesion diagnosed as a Spitz nevus and a metastatic malignant
  melanoma approximately 4 years thereafter is described. A diagnosis of SMM was made
  subsequently upon review of the primary lesion. In the present analysis, we used
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH to define markers characteristic of SMM. The
  primary lesion revealed deletions on chromosomes 6q and 9p. In the metastasis, additional
  deletions on chromosomes 10p and 10q and gains of chromosome 7 were found. To our
  knowledge, no chromosomal aberration on chromosome 6 was hitherto demonstrated in
  benign melanocytic nevi. Findings reported in the literature suggest that human
  melanoma metastasis suppressor gene maps to 6q. In contrast, losses on chromosome
  9p seem to be an early event in the development of melanoma. However, they are not
  only found in melanomas but are occasionally present in Spitz nevi as well as in
  atypical nevi. The CGH result with deletion of 6q in this difficult to diagnose
  primary melanocytic lesion strongly supports the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.
  To demonstrate the reliability of loss on chromosome 6q as a marker of SMM, a larger
  number of lesions must be investigated.
