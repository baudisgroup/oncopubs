abstract: The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes BCR-ABL1,
  is the defining lesion of chronic myelogenous leukaemia CML and a subset of acute
  lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL . To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1
  to induce ALL, we performed a genome-wide analysis of diagnostic leukaemia samples
  from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43 BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML
  cases. IKZF1 encoding the transcription factor Ikaros was deleted in 83.7 of BCR-ABL1
  ALL, but not in chronic-phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired
  lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL lymphoid blast crisis . The IKZF1
  deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros
  isoform, or the complete loss of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion
  breakpoints suggested that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination is responsible for
  the deletions. These findings suggest that genetic lesions resulting in the loss
  of Ikaros function are an important event in the development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.
