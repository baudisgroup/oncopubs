abstract: 'The limited information available to date regarding the genetic alterations
  in germ cell tumors of the central nervous system has raised concerns about their
  biologic relationship to other germ cell tumor entities. We investigated fresh-frozen
  or archival tumor samples from 19 patients with central nervous system germ cell
  tumors CNS-GCTs , including seven germinomas, eight malignant nongerminomatous germ
  cell tumors and four teratomas, using chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization
  to determine recurrent chromosomal imbalances. All 15 malignant CNS-GCTs and two
  of four teratomas showed multiple chromosomal imbalances. Chromosomal gains median:
  4 gains tumor, range: 0-9 gains tumor were observed more frequently than losses
  median: 1.6 losses tumor, range: 0-6 losses tumor . Gain of 12p, which is considered
  characteristic for germ cell tumors of the adult testis, was detected in 11 of 19
  tumors and 10 of 15 malignant CNS-GCTs. In one tumor, gain of 12p was confined to
  an amplicon at 12p12, corresponding to the commonly amplified region on 12p. Other
  common gains were found on chromosome arms 1q and 8q n 9, each . Among the chromosomal
  losses, parts of chromosome 11 n 5 , 18 n 4 , and 13 n 3 were deleted most frequently.
  Notably, we observed no difference in the genetic profiles of germinomatous and
  nongerminomatous CNS-GCTs however, the average number of imbalances was higher in
  the latter group. A meta-analysis comparing 116 malignant gonadal and extragonadal
  germ cell tumors revealed that the genomic alterations in CNS-GCTs are virtually
  indistinguishable from those found in their gonadal or other extragonadal counterparts
  of the corresponding age group. These data strongly argue in favor of common pathogenetic
  mechanisms in gonadal and extragonadal germ cell tumors.'
