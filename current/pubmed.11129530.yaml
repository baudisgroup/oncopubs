abstract: Schwannomas occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis
  2 NF2 , an autosomal dominant disorder, which predisposes to multiple schwannomas,
  meningiomas and spinal ependymomas, with bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the
  classic hallmark. As NF2 and sporadic schwannomas differ in some respect in their
  clinical and biological behavior we evaluated whether there are any differences
  in the distribution of genetic aberrations between NF2 and sporadic schwannomas.
  Our interest was also to verify whether secondary genetic alterations besides the
  loss of 22q could be detected in schwannomas.
