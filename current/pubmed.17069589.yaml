abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma SCC remains the leading cause of cancer
  related deaths in Linzhou formerly Linxian , the highest incidence area for esophageal
  cancer EC in Henan, northern China. In China, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma GCA
  shares very similar geographic distribution with SCC, suggesting the possibility
  of similar risk factors involved in SCC and GCA carcinogenesis in these areas. However,
  the underlying genetic alterations for esophageal and gastric cardia carcinogenesis,
  especially for the molecular difference between SCC and GCA, are largely unknown.
  The present study was thus undertaken to determine the difference in chromosomal
  aberrations in SCC n 37 and GCA n 31 using the comparative genomic hybridization
  method CGH . All the patients were from Linzhou, Henan, a high-risk geographic region
  for both SCC and GCA. CGH results showed that chromosomal aberrations with different
  degrees were identified both in SCC and GCA. In SCC, chromosomal profile of DNA
  copy number was characterized by most frequently detected gains at 8q 29 37, 78
  , 3q 24 37, 65 and 5p 19 37, 51 and frequently detected losses at 3p 21 37, 57 ,
  8p and 9q 14 37, 38 . In GCA, the frequently detected gains were identified at 20q
  13 31, 42 , 6q 12 31, 39 and 8q 11 31, 35 the DNA copy number losses in GCA occurred
  frequently at 17p 17 31, 55 , 19p 15 31, 48 and 1p 14 31, 45 . Statistically, there
  were evident differences between SCC and GCA in DNA copy number gains at 8q, 3q,
  5p and 20q P amp lt 0.05 and in losses at 3p, 8p, 5q, 17p and 18q P amp lt 0.05
  . Gains at 8q were frequently observed in both SCC and GCA. Gains at 3q and 8p were
  frequently observed in TNM stage III of both SCC and GCA. The present CGH results
  provide candidate regions that may contain specific related genes involved in SCC
  and GCA in the Linzhou population. Gains at 8q, 3q and 5p and losses at 3p, 8p and
  9q were specifically implicated in SCC gains at 20q, 6q and 8q and losses at 17p,
  19p and 1p were specifically implicated in GCA gains at 8q were implicated in both
  SCC and GCA.
