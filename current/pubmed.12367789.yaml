abstract: 'The aim of this study was to provide cytogenetic data about squamous cell
  carcinomas of the lung and to evaluate their characteristic alterations and histogenetic
  relations. We analyzed 41 squamous cell lung carcinomas by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH technique. CGH was performed using directly fluorochrome-conjugated DNA. Chromosomal
  regions where the mean ratio fell below 0.75 were therefore considered to reflect
  DNA copy number loss underrepresentation , whereas regions where the mean ratio
  exceeded 1.25 were considered gains overrepresentations in the tumor genome. Overrepresentations
  were considered to be high-level amplification when the fluorescence ratio exceeded
  1.5. Chromosomal imbalances were observed in every case. Copy number gains frequently
  were detected at 3q, 5p, 8q, 12p, and Xq. Losses were found at 16p, 4q, 5q, 3p,
  17p, and 16q. DNA amplifications were observed at 12 regions: 3q26.1-27, 8q13-23.1,
  12p12.3-pter, 12q15, 2p14-16, 4q28-31.2, 5p13.1-pter, 6q21-22.3, 7p11.2-13, 13q21.2-32,
  18p11.2-pter, and 20p11.2-pter. Gains on 3q were frequently detected not only in
  the more than 3 cm group 79 but also in the 3 cm or less group 77 . The mean frequency
  of gained or lost chromosomal regions was 7.2 -4.7 in the 3 cm or less group n 13
  and 10.2 -6.3 in the more than 3 cm group n 28 P 0.4503 . The mean frequency of
  gained or lost chromosomal regions was significantly higher in the carcinoma with
  lymph node metastasis group 12.5 -7.6 regions n 12 than in the carcinoma without
  lymph node metastasis group 7.9 -4.6 n 29 P 0.0251 . In conclusion, an increased
  copy number at 3q may contribute to the development of squamous cell carcinoma of
  the lung.'
