abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH allows the identification
  of DNA sequence copy number changes at high resolution by co-hybridizing differentially
  labelled test and control DNAs to a micro-array of genomic clones. The present study
  has analysed a series of 23 formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples
  of Barretts adenocarcinoma BCA, n 18 and non-neoplastic squamous oesophageal n 2
  and gastric cardia mucosa n 3 by aCGH. The micro-arrays used contained 287 genomic
  targets covering oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, and DNA sequences localized
  within chromosomal regions previously reported to be altered in BCA. DNA sequence
  copy number changes for a panel of approximately 50 genes were identified, most
  of which have not been previously described in BCA. DNA sequence copy number gains
  mean 41 - 25 BCA were more frequent than DNA sequence copy number losses mean 20
  - 15 BCA . The highest frequencies for DNA sequence copy number gains were detected
  for SNRPN 61 GNLY 44 NME1 44 DDX15, ABCB1 MDR , ATM, LAMA3, MYBL2, ZNF217, and TNFRSF6B
  39 each and MSH2, TERC, SERPINE1, AFM137XA11, IGF1R, and PTPN1 33 each . DNA sequence
  copy number losses were identified for PDGFB 44 D17S125 39 AKT3 28 and RASSFI, FHIT,
  CDKN2A p16 , and SAS CDK4 28 each . In all non-neoplastic tissue samples of squamous
  oesophageal and gastric cardia mucosa, the measured mean ratios were 1.00 squamous
  oesophageal mucosa or 1.01 gastric mucosa , indicating that no DNA sequence copy
  number chances were present. For validation, the DNA sequence copy number changes
  of selected clones SNRPN, CMYC, HER2, ZNF217 detected by aCGH were confirmed by
  fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . These data show the sensitivity of aCGH
  for the identification of DNA sequence copy number changes at high resolution in
  BCA. The newly identified genes may include so far unknown biomarkers in BCA and
  are therefore a starting point for further studies elucidating their possible role
  in Barretts carcinogenesis.
