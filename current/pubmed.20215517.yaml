abstract: Because topoisomerase 1 TOP1 is critical for the relaxation of DNA supercoils
  and because it is the target for the anticancer activity of camptothecins, we assessed
  TOP1 transcript levels in the 60 cell line panel the NCI-60 of the National Cancer
  Institutes anticancer drug screen. TOP1 expression levels varied over a 5.7-fold
  range across the NCI-60. HCT116 colon and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were the highest
  expressers SK-MEL-28 melanoma and HS578T breast carcinoma cells were the lowest.
  TOP1 mRNA expression was highly correlated with Top1 protein levels, indicating
  that TOP1 transcripts could be conveniently used to monitor Top1 protein levels
  and activity in tissues. Assessment of the TOP1 locus by array comparative genomic
  hybridization across the NCI-60 showed copy numbers ranging from 1.71 to 4.13 and
  a statistically significant correlation with TOP1 transcript levels P amp lt 0.01
  . Further analyses of TOP1 expression on an exon-specific basis revealed that exon
  1 expression was generally higher and less variable than expression of the other
  exons, suggesting some form of transcriptional pausing regulation between exons
  1 and 2. Accordingly, we found the presence of multiple evolutionarily conserved
  potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the first TOP1 intron. Physicochemical
  tests for actual quadruplex formation by several of those sequences yielded quadruplex
  formation for two of them and duplex formation for one. The observations reported
  here suggest the hypothesis that there is a conserved negative transcription regulator
  within intron 1 of the TOP1 gene associated with a quadruplex-prone region.
