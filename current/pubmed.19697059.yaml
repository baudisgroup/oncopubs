abstract: DNA copy-number gains of chromosomes 8q, 13q, and 20q are frequently observed
  in gastric cancers. Moreover gain of chromosome 20q has been associated with lymph
  node metastasis. The aim of this study was to correlate DNA copy-number changes
  of individual genes on chromosomes 8q, 13q, and 20q in gastric adenocarcinomas to
  clinicopathological data. DNA isolated from 63 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
  gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples was analyzed by whole-genome microarray comparative
  genomic hybridization and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification MLPA
  , targeting 58 individual genes on chromosomes 8, 13, and 20. Using array comparative
  genomic hybridization, gains on 8q, 13q, and 20q were observed in 49 77.8 , 25 39.7
  , and 49 77.8 gastric adenocarcinomas, respectively. Gain of chromosome 20q was
  significantly correlated with lymph node metastases p 0.05 and histological type
  p 0.02 . MLPA revealed several genes to be frequently gained in DNA copy number.
  The oncogene c-myc on 8q was gained in 73 of the cancers, while FOXO1A and ATP7B
  on 13q were both gained in 28.6 of the cases. Multiple genes on chromosome 20q showed
  gains in more than 60 of the cancers. DNA copy-number gains of TNFRSF6B 20q13.3
  and ZNF217 20q13.2 were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis p 0.02
  and histological type p 0.02 , respectively. In summary, gains of chromosomes 8q,
  13q, and 20q in gastric adenocarcinomas harbor DNA copy-number gains of known and
  putative oncogenes. ZNF217 and TNFRSF6B are associated with important clinicopathological
  variables, including lymph node status.
