abstract: Genome-wide profiling of rare tumors is crucial for improvement of diagnosis,
  treatment, and, consequently, achieving better outcomes. Desmoplastic small round
  cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare type of sarcoma arising from mesenchymal cells of abdominal
  peritoneum that usually develops in male adolescents and young adults. A specific
  translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12), resulting in EWS and WT1 gene fusion is the only
  recurrent molecular hallmark and no other genetic factor has been associated to
  this aggressive tumor. Here, we present a comprehensive genomic profiling of one
  DSRCT affecting a 26-year-old male, who achieved an excellent outcome.We investigated
  somatic and germline variants through whole-exome sequencing using a family based
  approach and, by array CGH, we explored the occurrence of genomic imbalances. Additionally,
  we performed mate-paired whole-genome sequencing for defining the specific breakpoint
  of the EWS-WT1 translocation, allowing us to develop a personalized tumor marker
  for monitoring the patient by liquid biopsy.We identified genetic variants leading
  to protein alterations including 12 somatic and 14 germline events (11 germline
  compound heterozygous mutations and 3 rare homozygous polymorphisms) affecting genes
  predominantly involved in mesenchymal cell differentiation pathways. Regarding copy
  number alterations (CNA) few events were detected, mainly restricted to gains in
  chromosomes 5 and 18 and losses at 11p, 13q, and 22q. The deletions at 11p and 22q
  indicated the presence of the classic translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12). In addition,
  the mapping of the specific genomic breakpoint of the EWS-WT1 gene fusion allowed
  the design of a personalized biomarker for assessing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
  in plasma during patient follow-up. This biomarker has been used in four post-treatment
  blood samples, 3ï¿½years after surgery, and no trace of EWS-WT1 gene fusion was
  detected, in accordance with imaging tests showing no evidence of disease and with
  the good general health status of the patient.Overall, our findings revealed genes
  with potential to be associated with risk assessment and tumorigenesis of this rare
  type of sarcoma. Additionally, we established a liquid biopsy approach for monitoring
  patient follow-up based on genomic information that can be similarly adopted for
  patients diagnosed with a rare tumor.
