abstract: Distinct genetic abnormalities, such as TP53 deletion at 17p13.1, have been
  identified as having adverse prognostic relevance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia B-CLL , and conventional cytogenetic studies have shown that TP53 deletion
  in B-CLL is mainly associated with the loss of 17p due to complex chromosomal rearrangements.
  We used an integrative genomic approach to investigate the significance of 17p loss
  in 18 B-CLLs in Binet stage A, carrying a TP53 monoallelic deletion detected by
  means of fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . Genome-wide DNA analysis using
  single nucleotide polymorphism SNP arrays of 12 of 18 samples showed 17p loss in
  11 cases, with breakpoints scattered along the 17p11.2 region. FISH analysis confirmed
  these findings and revealed 17p loss in a small fraction of leukemic cells in the
  remaining TP53-deleted case, and it also indicated 17p loss in the six cases not
  investigated by means of SNP arrays. Mutations in exons 2-11 of the remaining TP53
  allele were found in 9 of 12 deleted samples. Gene-expression profiling of 60 B-CLLs,
  including seven patients with 17p loss, identified 40 differentially expressed genes
  in 17p- versus 17p normal samples, 35 of which were downregulated in 17p-tumors.
  The majority 30 of 35 of these transcripts, including putative tumor suppressor
  genes, mapped to 17p, thus indicating a remarkable gene-dosage effect. Our data
  provide evidence that 17p loss may play an additional pathogenetic role in B-CLL
  and suggest that the concomitant loss of multiple tumor suppressor genes could be
  responsible for the highly adverse prognostic relevance associated with TP53 loss.
