abstract: The frequent occurrence of persistent or relapsed disease after induction
  chemotherapy in AML necessitates a better understanding of the clonal relationship
  of AML in various disease phases. In this study, we used SNP 6.0 array-based genomic
  profiling of acquired copy number aberrations aCNA and copy neutral LOH cnLOH together
  with sequence analysis of recurrently mutated genes to characterize paired AML genomes.
  We analyzed 28 AML sample pairs from patients who achieved complete remission with
  chemotherapy and subsequently relapsed and 11 sample pairs from patients with persistent
  disease after induction chemotherapy. Through review of aCNA cnLOH and gene mutation
  profiles in informative cases, we demonstrate that relapsed AML invariably represents
  re-emergence or evolution of a founder clone. Furthermore, all individual aCNA or
  cnLOH detected at presentation persisted at relapse indicating that this lesion
  type is proximally involved in AML evolution. Analysis of informative paired persistent
  AML disease samples uncovered cases with 2 coexisting dominant clones of which at
  least one was chemotherapy sensitive and one resistant, respectively. These data
  support the conclusion that incomplete eradication of AML founder clones rather
  than stochastic emergence of fully unrelated novel clones underlies AML relapse
  and persistence with direct implications for clinical AML research.
