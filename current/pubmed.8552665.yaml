abstract: We have chosen tumors of the uterine cervix as a model system to identify
  chromosomal aberrations that occur during carcinogenesis. A phenotype genotype correlation
  was established in defined regions of archived, formalin-fixed, and hematoxylin
  eosin-stained tissue sections that were dissected from normal cervical epithelium
  n 3 , from mild n 4 , moderate n 6 , and severe dysplasias carcinomas in situ CIS
  n 13 , and from invasive carcinomas n 10 and investigated by comparative genomic
  hybridization. The same tissues were analyzed for DNA ploidy, proliferative activity,
  and the presence of human papillomavirus HPV sequences. The results show that an
  increase in proliferative activity and tetraploidization had occurred already in
  mildly dysplastic lesions. No recurrent chromosomal aberrations were observed in
  DNA extracted from normal epithelium or from mild and moderate dysplasias, indicating
  that the tetraploidization precedes the loss or gain of specific chromosomes. A
  gain of chromosome 3q became visible in one of the severe dysplasias CIS. Notably,
  chromosome 3q was overrepresented in 90 of the carcinomas and was also found to
  have undergone a high-level copy-number increase amplification . We therefore conclude
  that the gain of chromosome 3q that occurs in HPV16-infected, aneuploid cells represents
  a pivotal genetic aberration at the transition from severe dysplasia CIS to invasive
  cervical carcinoma.
