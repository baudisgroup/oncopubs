abstract: Borderline tumors of the ovary comprise 10-20 of all epithelial ovarian
  tumors, and are placed between clearly benign and obviously malignant ovarian tumors.
  The issue of whether borderline tumors are precursors of invasive carcinoma or distinct
  clinical entities, however, is still the subject of discussion. To increase our
  understanding in relation to this issue, the aim of our study was to analyze both
  serous borderline and invasive ovarian tumors, and to investigate early carcinogenesis
  in serous ovarian tumors. Using comparative genomic hybridization, we compared cytogenetic
  changes in borderline ovarian tumors and stage I invasive tumors. The average number
  of genetic alterations differed significantly between the borderline and the invasive
  tumors 1.9 and 9.2, respectively . The most common genetic alterations among the
  borderline tumors were loss of chromosome 17, 20q, and 18p, and gain of 12p13 approximately
  q23. These changes were also found among the invasive tumors in a similar percentage.
  In conclusion, we found four distinct cytogenetic alterations that might be early
  events in serous ovarian tumors, and that might also characterize a subgroup of
  borderline ovarian tumors that may have the potential to progress and develop malignancy.
