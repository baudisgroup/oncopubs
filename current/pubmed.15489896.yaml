abstract: Identifying changes in DNA copy number can pinpoint genes that may be involved
  in tumor development. Here we have defined the smallest overlapping regions of imbalance
  SORI in testicular germ cell tumors other than the 12p region, which has been previously
  investigated. Definition of the regions was achieved through comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH analysis of a 4559 cDNA clone microarray. A total of 14 SORI were
  identified, which involved at least five of the 11 samples analysed. Many of these
  refined regions were previously reported using chromosomal or allelic imbalance
  studies. The SORI included gain of material from the regions 4q12, 17q21.3, 22q11.23
  and Xq22, and loss from 5q33, 11q12.1, 16q22.3 and 22q11. Comparison with parallel
  chromosomal CGH data supported involvement of most regions. The various SORI span
  between one and 20 genes and highlight potential oncogenes tumor suppressor genes
  to be investigated further.
