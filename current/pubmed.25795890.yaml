abstract: "Enrolling patients with ad hoc molecular alterations is one of the current
  challenges in early drug development. The MOSCATO 01 trial (NCT01566019) is one
  of the prospective trials ongoing worldwide using high throughput analysis for characterisation
  of the genomic alterations in cancer patients.  An \"on-purpose\" tumor biopsy was
  collected from consenting patients with metastatic cancer referred for a phase I
  trial. DNA extracted from the tumor biopsy was analysed by comparative genomic hybridization
  (CGH) (if â\x89¥ 30% tumor cells) and by hot spot mutations by Next Generation Sequencing
  (NGS) (if â\x89¥ 10% tumor cells). Recently, WES and RNAseq were implemented in
  the MOSCATO trial.  Between December 2011 and November 2014, 708 patients were enrolled
  in the MOSCATO 01 trial, and 639 patients (90%) had undergone a tumor biopsy. Patient
  characteristics were as follows: median age at biopsy: 57 years (range, 18-78);
  main tumor types: lung (14%), Head and neck (13%), prostate and bladder (11%), breast
  (10%), median of 3 previous lines of treatment. Molecular profiling with CGH and
  NGS was performed in 510 (80%) and 565 patients (88%) respectively, with median
  analysis turnaround of 21 days. Clinical significant molecular alterations were
  found in 288 patients (45%), most frequently in PTEN/PI3K/AKT (n = 84), FGFR/FGF
  (n = 46), KRAS/NRAS/HRAS (n = 24), HER2/EGFR (n = 22/18) pathways. Patients with
  rare genomic alterations were also identified (eg MDM2, MET, AR, ALK, KIT, and ROS1
  alterations among others). Therapy could be personalised in 141 patients (49%) with
  matched targeted therapy or dedicated phase I clinical trials. Preliminary results
  of WES and RNAseq as well as the response rate of patients with specific molecular
  alterations treated with matched targeted therapies will be updated and presented
  at the TAT meeting.  Our updated results confirm in a larger cohort of patients
  the feasibility of molecular characterisation of cancer patients in routine clinical
  practice. Such approach allows the enrichment of early-phase clinical trials with
  specific and rare genomic alterations.  Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford
