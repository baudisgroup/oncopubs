abstract: 'Neuroblastoma NB is a pediatric neoplasia that shows complex combinations
  of acquired genetic aberrations. The specific genes and the molecular mechanisms
  responsible for development and progression of NB remain poorly understood. Our
  main objective is to compare the results obtained with different techniques for
  the detection of genomic data in 20 patients with NB using the information obtained
  to select the appropriate technique in routine analysis for the therapeutic stratification.
  The genetic methods used in this study are multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH assay, metaphasic comparative genomic hybridization mCGH , array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH , and the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
  MLPA . Genomic copy number abnormalities were used to group the cases in four categories:
  MYCN amplification cases 11q deletion tumors cases with partial chromosome gains
  or losses and samples with entire chromosome alterations. The data obtained from
  the multigenomic techniques showed a high degree of concordance and our findings
  support the hypothesis that NB consists of biologically distinct subgroups that
  differ by genetic characteristics of prognostic relevance. FISH will be essential
  for the mandatory study of MYCN status. The use of MLPA as routine technique is
  an advantage procedure for detecting the implication of the common genetic alterations
  in NB.'
