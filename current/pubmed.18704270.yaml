abstract: Gliomatosis cerebri GC are extensively infiltrative glial tumors classified
  as astrocytic tumors in the current World Health Organization WHO classification
  scheme. In investigating the tumorigenesis of GC, we reviewed 28 cases of GC immunohistochemically
  and carried out array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH in ten of those
  cases. In histological and immunohistochemical review, 18 cases 64 were of astrocytic
  lineage, three 11 were of oligodendroglial lineage, and seven 25 were of uncommitted
  lineage. In the array-based CGH, 52 clones were frequently lost on 6p, 9p, and 9q
  in more than six cases, and six clones were frequently gained on 1p, 6q, 10q, and
  21q in more than three cases. Some gained or lost genetic loci differed significantly
  between the histologically high-grade and low-grade GC P amp lt 0.05 , but unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering failed to produce evidence of any clinical significance.
  These altered genetic foci are not known to be involved in the development of conventional
  glial tumors, including astrocytic tumors. In conclusion, despite the dominant astrocytic
  differentiation of GC histologically, novel genomic aberrations found in our GC
  cases were different from those of astrocytic tumors.
