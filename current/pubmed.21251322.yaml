abstract: To evaluate the clinical validity of genome-wide oligonucleotide array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH for detecting somatic abnormalities, we have applied
  this genomic analysis to 30 cases 13 MDS and 17 AML with clonal chromosomal abnormalities
  detected in more than 50 of analyzed metaphase cells.
