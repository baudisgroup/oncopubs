abstract: We have established a method for using a cDNA array platform in combination
  with degenerate oligonucleotide primer polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR and taramide
  signal amplification TSA to identify DNA copy number abnormalities CNA in cancer
  cell lines and cancer cells procured with laser-based microdissection. To determine
  the sensitivity and specificity for detecting single-copy gain and loss, receiver-operator
  curve analysis was performed on hybridization signal ratios generated from non-DOP
  and DOP amplified female and male DNA using a 10,816-element cDNA microarray. A
  cutoff value of 1.12 and 1.07 average signal ratio for X-chromosomal genes versus
  autosomal genes provided a sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 79 , respectively,
  for non-DOP amplified DNA and a sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 72 , respectively,
  for DOP amplified DNA. We used this approach to identify DNA copy number abnormalities
  in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCA633, which has previously been shown to have
  12p amplification. Transcription profiling of OVCA633 was also performed. Two amplified
  and overexpressed genes located on 12p11, KRAS2 and LRMP, were identified these
  were validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequently, the same approach
  was used to identify CNAs and gene expression alterations in 11 microdissected serous
  ovarian adenocarcinoma cases. Validated data revealed amplification and overexpression
  of ERBB3 and FOS and deletion and underexpression of KRT6 and APXL in more than
  50 of the tissue samples. These results show the feasibility of using the cDNA array
  platform to identify changes in DNA and mRNA copy number simultaneously in microdissected
  tumor tissues.
