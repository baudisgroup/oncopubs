abstract: Biological characteristics of malignant tumors including head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma HNSCC are greatly affected by genetic alterations. However, the relationship
  between chromosomal aberrations and pathologic tumor stage in HNSCC has not been
  elucidated. In 32 patients, DNA sequence copy number aberrations DSCNA were surveyed
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH combined with a microdissection method.
  The average number of DSCNA was 15.3 per tumor and increased with tumor stage P
  amp lt .05 . DNA copy number gain was detected at 3q26 approximately qter in 29
  tumors 91 , and 13 of these tumors displayed marked DNA amplification. Tumor stage
  was linked with this amplification P amp lt .05 . The increase in DSCNA and amplification
  of 3q26 approximately qter are likely to be useful markers for estimating tumor
  progression in HNSCC.
