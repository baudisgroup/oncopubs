abstract: Accurate cancer risk assessment of low-dose radiation poses many challenges
  that are partly due to the inability to distinguish radiation-induced tumors from
  spontaneous ones. To elucidate characteristic features of radiation-induced tumors,
  we analyzed 163 medulloblastomas that developed either spontaneously or after X-ray
  irradiation at doses of 0.05-3 Gy in Ptch1 heterozygous mice. All spontaneous tumors
  showed loss of heterozygosity in broad regions on chromosome 13, with losses at
  all consecutive markers distal to Ptch1 locus S-type . In contrast, all tumors that
  developed after 3 Gy irradiation exhibited interstitial losses around Ptch1 with
  distal markers retained R-type . There was a clear dose-dependent increase in the
  proportion of R-type tumors within the intermediate dose range, indicating that
  the R-type change is a reliable radiation signature. Importantly, the incidence
  of R-type tumors increased significantly P 0.007 at a dose as low as 50 mGy. Integrated
  array-comparative genomic hybridization and expression microarray analyses demonstrated
  that expression levels of many genes around the Ptch1 locus faithfully reflected
  the signature-associated reduction in genomic copy number. Furthermore, 573 genes
  on other chromosomes were also expressed differently between S-type and R-type tumors.
  They include genes whose expression changes during early cerebellar development
  such as Plagl1 and Tgfb2, suggesting a recapitulation of gene subsets functioning
  at distinct developmental stages. These findings provide, for the first time, solid
  experimental evidence for a significant increase in cancer risk by low-dose radiation
  at diagnostic levels and imply that radiation-induced carcinogenesis accompanies
  both genomic and gene expression signatures.
