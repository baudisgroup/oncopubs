abstract: Histologic response to chemotherapy is currently the best prognostic parameter
  in high-grade osteosarcoma but it can be evaluated only after several weeks of chemotherapy.
  Thus a prognostic parameter known at the time of diagnosis would be of great clinical
  benefit. In the present study, we present the results of 31 primary high-grade osteosarcomas
  analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . CGH allows for genome-wide screening
  of a tumor by detecting alterations in DNA sequence copy number. The most frequent
  aberrations were copy number increases at 1q21 in 58 of the tumors and at 8q 8q21.3-q22
  in 52 and 8cen-q13 in 45 , followed by copy number increases at 14q24-qter 35 and
  Xp11.2-p21 35 . The most common losses were detected at 6q16 32 and 6q21-q22 32
  . Patients with a copy number increase at 8q21.3-q22 and or at 8cen-q13 had a statistically
  significant poor distant disease-free survival p 0.003 and showed a trend toward
  short overall survival p 0.04 . Patients with a copy number increase at 1q21 showed
  a trend toward short overall survival p 0.04 . Thus, specific genetic aberrations
  detected at the time of the diagnosis could be used in prognostic evaluation of
  high-grade osteosarcoma.
