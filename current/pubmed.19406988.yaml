abstract: Precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL in children represents
  a clinical challenge, because relapses are usually fatal. It is thus necessary to
  identify high-risk patients as early as possible to effectively individualize treatment.
  We aimed to define novel molecular risk markers in T-ALL and performed array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH and expression analyses in 73 patients.
  We show that DNA copy-number changes are common in T-ALL and affect 70 of 73 96
  patients. Notably, genomic imbalances predicted to down-regulate the TGF-beta or
  up-regulate the PI3K-AKT pathways are identified in 25 of 73 34 and 21 of 73 29
  patients, suggesting that these pathways play key roles in T-ALL leukemogenesis.
  Furthermore, we identified a deletion at 6q15-16.1 in 9 of 73 12 of the patients,
  which predicts poor early treatment response. This deletion includes the CASP8AP2
  gene, whose expression is shown to be down-regulated. The interaction of CASP8AP2
  with CASP8 plays a crucial role in apoptotic regulation, suggesting a functional
  link between the clinical effect of the deletion and the molecular mode of action.
  The data presented here implicate the TGF-beta and PI3K-AKT pathways in T-ALL leukemogenesis
  and identify a subgroup of patients with CASP8AP2 deletions and poor early treatment
  response.
