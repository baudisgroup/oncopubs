abstract: Genome-wide microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH
  was used to identify common chromosomal alterations involved in cervical carcinogenesis
  as a first step towards the discovery of novel biomarkers. The genomic profiles
  of nine squamous cell carcinomas SCCs and seven adenocarcinomas AdCAs , as well
  as four human papillomavirus HPV -immortalized keratinocyte cell lines, were assessed.
  On a genome-wide scale, SCCs showed significantly more gains than AdCAs. More specifically,
  there was a striking and highly significant difference between the two histological
  types for gain at 3q12.1-28, which was predominantly observed in SCC. Other frequent
  alterations included gains of 1q21.1-31.1 and 20q11.21-13.33, and losses of 11q22.3-25
  and 13q14.3-21.33. Subsequent FISH analysis for hTR, located at 3q26, confirmed
  the presence of 3q gain in SCCs and HPV-immortalized cell lines. Fine mapping of
  chromosome 20q using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification MLPA showed
  copy number increases for a number of genes located at 20q11-q12, including DNMT3B
  and TOP1. For DNMT3B, this correlated with elevated mRNA expression in 79 of cases.
  In conclusion, the assessment of frequent genomic alterations resulted in the identification
  of potential novel biomarkers, which may ultimately enable a better risk stratification
  of high-risk hr -HPV-positive women.
