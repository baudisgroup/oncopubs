abstract: Early detection of lung cancer provides the highest potential for saving
  lives. To date, no routine screening method enabling early detection is available,
  which is a key factor in the diseases high mortality rate. Copy number changes and
  DNA methylation alterations are good indicators of carcinogenesis and cancer prognosis.
  In this study, we attempted to combine profiles of DNA copy number and methylation
  patterns in 20 paired cancerous and noncancerous tissue samples from non-small cell
  lung cancer NSCLC patients, and we detected several clinically important genes with
  genetic and epigenetic relationships. Using array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH , statistically significant differences were observed across the histological
  subtypes for gains at 1p31.1, 3q26.1, and 3q26.31-3q29 as well as for losses at
  1p21.1, 2q33.3, 2q37.3, 3p12.3, 4q35.2, and 13q34 in squamous cell carcinoma SQ
  patients, and losses at 12q24.33 were measured in adenocarcinoma AD patients p amp
  lt 0.05 . In an analysis of DNA methylation at 1505 autosomal CpG loci that are
  associated with 807 cancer-related genes, we identified six and nine loci with higher
  and lower DNA methylation levels, respectively, in tumor tissue compared to non-tumor
  lung tissues from AD patients. In addition, three loci with higher and seven loci
  with lower DNA methylation levels were identified in tumor tissue from SQ patients
  compared to non-tumor lung tissue. Subsequently, we searched for regions exhibiting
  concomitant hypermethylation and genomic loss in both ADs and SQs. One clone representing
  7p15.2 which includes candidate genes such as HOXA9 and HOXA11 and one target ID
  representing HOXA9_E252_R were detected. Quantitative real-time PCR identified the
  potential candidate gene HOXA9 as being down-regulated in the majority of NSCLC
  patients. Moreover, following HOXA9 over-expression, the invasion of representative
  cell lines, A549 and HCC95, were significantly inhibited. Taken together, our results
  show that the combined profiling analysis technique is a useful tool for identifying
  biomarkers in lung cancer and that HOXA9 might be a potential candidate gene for
  the pathogenesis and diagnosis of NSCLC patients.
