abstract: The etiology of Hodgkin lymphoma HL is poorly understood, and studies of
  the genetics of this disease have been hampered by the scarcity of the Hodgkin and
  Reed-Sternberg HRS cells within tumors. To determine whether recurrent genomic imbalances
  are a feature of HL, CD30-positive HRS cells were laser-microdissected from 20 classical
  Hodgkin lymphomas cHLs and four HL-derived cells lines and subjected to analyses
  by comparative genomic hybridization. In primary tumors, the most frequently involved
  chromosomal gains were 17q 70 , 2p 40 , 12q 40 , 17p 40 , 22q 35 , 9p 30 , 14q 30
  , and 16p 30 , with minimal overlapping regions at 17q21, 2p23-13, 12q24, 17p13,
  22q13, 9p24-23, 14q32, 16p13.3, and 16p11.2. The most frequent losses involved 13q
  35 , 6q 30 , 11q 25 , and 4q 25 , with corresponding minimal overlapping regions
  at 13q21, 6q22, 11q22, and 4q32. Statistical analysis revealed significantly more
  gains of 2p and 14q in the older adult cases loss of 13q was associated with a poor
  outcome. The results suggest that there is a set of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities
  associated with cHL and provide further evidence that cHL is genetically distinct
  from nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin lymphoma NLPHL . Abnormalities of 17q
  are infrequent in other lymphomas or NLPHL this finding, coupled with current knowledge
  of gene expression in cHL, suggests that genes present on 17q may play an important
  role in the pathogenesis of cHL.
