abstract: 'We used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze 17 tumor samples from
  11 patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma RCC , including three patients with
  hereditary papillary RCC. Whereas the most frequent aberrations confirmed data obtained
  by banding analyses, copy number increases on 5q, which previously were considered
  characteristic of nonpapillary RCC, were identified in two cases. In two complex
  cases belonging to the same family, a characteristic pattern of chromosomal aberrations
  was found: five of the six imbalances present in the less complex case were included
  in the karyotype of the other case, suggesting a genetically determined mechanism
  resulting in genomic instability of specific chromosomes or chromosomal subregions
  and or selection of specific mutations.'
