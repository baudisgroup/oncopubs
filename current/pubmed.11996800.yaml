abstract: Ganglioglioma is a mixed neuronal and glial tumor first described by Perkin
  in 1926. Because of its rare occurrence in the central nervous system, the pathogenesis
  of this neoplasm is still largely unknown. Previous studies of ganglioglioma mainly
  focused on histologic features, immunohistochemical analysis, clinical treatment,
  and patient outcome. Very few cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies have been
  reported on this neoplasm. To better understand the mechanism underlying the development
  of ganglioglioma, we performed comparative genomic hybridization analysis to investigate
  chromosomal imbalances across the entire genome in five cases of gangliogliomas.
  Loss of genetic material on the short arm of chromosome 9 was a common genetic alteration
  found in three of five cases. Overrepresentation of partial or the whole chromosome
  7 was another recurrent chromosomal imbalance, confirmed by fluorescence in situ
  hybridization. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed all five cases revealed
  no reaction or low expression for epidermal growth factor receptor antibody. Our
  study highlights chromosomal regions for further fine mapping and investigation
  of candidate tumor suppressor genes involved in the pathogenesis of ganglioglioma.
