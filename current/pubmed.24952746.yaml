abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC has extremely skewed ethnic and geographic
  distributions, is poorly understood at the genetic level and is in need of effective
  therapeutic approaches. Here we determined the mutational landscape of 128 cases
  with NPC using whole-exome and targeted deep sequencing, as well as SNP array analysis.
  These approaches revealed a distinct mutational signature and nine significantly
  mutated genes, many of which have not been implicated previously in NPC. Notably,
  integrated analysis showed enrichment of genetic lesions affecting several important
  cellular processes and pathways, including chromatin modification, ERBB-PI3K signaling
  and autophagy machinery. Further functional studies suggested the biological relevance
  of these lesions to the NPC malignant phenotype. In addition, we uncovered a number
  of new druggable candidates because of their genomic alterations. Together our study
  provides a molecular basis for a comprehensive understanding of, and exploring new
  therapies for, NPC.
