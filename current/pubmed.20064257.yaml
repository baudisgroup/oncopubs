abstract: Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with involvement of multiple genes.  In
  this study, genome-wide screening for DNA copy-number variations (CNVs) was conducted
  for ten pairs, a total of 20 cases, of affected siblings using oligonucleotide array-based
  CGH.  We found negative symptoms were significantly more severe (p < 0.05) in the
  subgroup that harbored more genetic imbalance (n >== 13, n = number of CNV-disrupted
  genes) as compared with the subgroup with fewer CNVs (n <== 6), indicating that
  the degree of genetic imbalance may influence the severity of the negative symptoms
  of schizophrenia. Four central nervous system (CNS) related genes including CCAAT/enhancer
  binding protein, delta (CEBPD, 8q11.21), retinoid x receptor, alpha (RXRA, 9q34.2),
  LIM homeobox protein 5 (LHX5, 12q24.13) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11, 19p13.3)
  are recurrently (incidence >== 16.7%) disrupted by CNVs. Two genes, PVR (poliovirus
  receptor) and BU678720, are concordantly deleted in one and two, respectively, pairs
  of co-affected siblings. However, we did not find a significant association of this
  BU678720 deletion and schizophrenia in a large case-control sample.  We conclude
  that the high genetic loading of CNVs may be the underlying cause of negative symptoms
  of schizophrenia, and the CNS-related genes revealed by this study warrant further
  investigation.
