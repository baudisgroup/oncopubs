abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Globally, gastric cancer is the second most common cause of
  cancer-related death, with the majority of the health burden borne by economically
  less-developed countries. METHODS: Here, we report a genetic characterization of
  50 gastric adenocarcinoma samples, using affymetrix SNP arrays and Illumina mRNA
  expression arrays as well as Illumina sequencing of the coding regions of 384 genes
  belonging to various pathways known to be altered in other cancers. RESULTS: Genetic
  alterations were observed in the WNT, Hedgehog, cell cycle, DNA damage and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition
  pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggests targeted therapies approved or in clinical
  development for gastric carcinoma would be of benefit to 22 of the patients studied.
  In addition, the novel mutations detected here, are likely to influence clinical
  response and suggest new targets for drug discovery.'
