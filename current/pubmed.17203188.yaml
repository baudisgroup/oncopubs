abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a molecular cytogenetic technique
  that allows the genome-wide analysis of DNA sequence copy number differences. We
  applied conventional CGH and the recently developed high-resolution CGH HR-CGH to
  tumour samples from 18 patients with glioblastoma multiforme GBM in order to compare
  the sensitivity of CGH and HR-CGH in the screening of chromosomal abnormalities.
  The abnormalities were studied in topologically different central and peripheral
  tumour parts. A total of 78 different changes were observed using CGH 0-16 per tumour,
  median 3.5 and 154 using HR-CGH 0-21 per tumour, median 6 . Using HR-CGH, losses
  were more frequent than gains. The representation of the most prominent changes
  revealed by both methods was similar and was comprised of the amplification of 7q12
  and 12q13-q15, the gain of 7, 3q and 19, and the loss of 10, 9p, and 13q. However,
  HR-CGH detected certain other abnormalities the loss of 6, 14q, 15q and 18q, and
  the gain of 19 , which were rarely revealed by CGH. Using HR-CGH, the numbers and
  types of chromosomal changes detected in the central and peripheral parts of GBM
  were almost the same. The loss of chromosomes 10 and 9p and the gain of chromosomes
  7 and 19 were the most frequent chromosomal alterations in both tumour parts. Our
  results from the GBM analysis show that HR-CGH technology can reveal new, recurrent
  genetic alterations involving the genes known to participate in tumorigenesis and
  in the progression of several human malignancies, thus allowing for a more accurate
  genetic characterization of these tumours.
