abstract: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain
  and loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.
  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20 known
  tumor suppressor genes TSG , most not previously implicated in medulloblastoma.
  Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and homozygous deletions,
  including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting
  histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 H3K9 . Post-translational
  modification of histone proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression,
  can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.
  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling
  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy
  number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and
  blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest
  that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.
