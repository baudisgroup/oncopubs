abstract: Meningiomas are common tumors of the central nervous system. Although most
  are benign tumors, approximately 10 show a histologic progression to a higher malignancy
  grade similar to atypical GII and anaplastic GIII meningiomas. Monosomy 22q12 is
  the most frequent genetic alteration detected in these tumors, but failure of detection
  of 22q mutations in about 40 of tumors which are indistinguishable from meningiomas
  with 22q deletions with respect to clinical and histopathologic features, makes
  it apparent that an alternative mechanism is responsible for the initiation of meningioma.
  Moreover, little is known about genetic alterations during malignant progression
  of meningioma.
