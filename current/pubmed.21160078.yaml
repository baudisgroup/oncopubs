abstract: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in
  developed countries. Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK
  fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and anaplastic
  lymphoma kinase ALK inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently
  lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic
  search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically
  amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified
  frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 FGFR1 amplification in squamous
  cell lung cancer n 155 , but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence
  in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent
  cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples 22 of cases . Using cell-based screening
  with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large n 83 panel of lung cancer cell lines,
  we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically
  in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence
  of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an
  FGFR1-resistant allele FGFR1 V561M , which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated
  cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule
  led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common
  in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting
  that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.
