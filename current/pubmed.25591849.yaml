abstract: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is clinically characterized by reduced
  number of peripheral B cells and diminished levels of serum immunoglobulins, and
  caused by a mutation in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, which play a pivotal
  role in signal transduction of pre-B-cell receptor (BCR) and BCR. B-cell precursor
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children,
  and it may be associated with gene alterations that regulate B-cell development.
  Here we described a first case of XLA associated BCP-ALL. The whole-exome sequencing
  revealed a somatic mutation in MLL2 in the sample from the onset of BCP-ALL. This
  study suggests that the alterations of BTK and MLL2 synergistically function as
  leukemogenesis.
