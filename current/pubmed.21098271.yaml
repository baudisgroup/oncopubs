abstract: High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is one of the most common
  malignancies in children. It is characterized by gain of chromosomes, typically
  X, 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18, and 21, 21 little is known about additional genetic aberrations.
  Approximately 20 of the patients relapse therefore it is clinically important to
  identify risk-stratifying markers. We used SNP array analysis to investigate a consecutive
  series of 74 cases of high hyperdiploid ALL. We show that the characteristic chromosomal
  gains are even more frequent than previously believed, indicating that karyotyping
  mistakes are common, and that almost 80 of the cases display additional abnormalities
  detectable by SNP array analysis. Subclonality analysis strongly implied that the
  numerical aberrations were primary and arose before structural events, suggesting
  that step-wise evolution of the leukemic clone is common. An association between
  duplication of 1q and 5 was seen P 0.003 . Other frequent abnormalities included
  whole-chromosome uniparental isodisomies wUPIDs 9 and 11, gain of 17q not associated
  with isochromosome formation, extra gain of part of 21q, deletions of ETS variant
  6 ETV6 , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A CKDN2A and paired box 5 PAX5 , and
  PAN3 poly A specific ribonuclease subunit homolog PAN3 microdeletions. Comparison
  of whole-chromosome and partial UPID9 suggested different pathogenetic outcomes,
  with the former not involving CDKN2A. Finally, two cases had partial deletions of
  AT rich interactive domain 5B ARID5B , indicating that acquired as well as constitutional
  variants in this locus may be associated with pediatric ALL. Here we provide a comprehensive
  characterization of the genetic landscape of high hyperdiploid childhood ALL, including
  the heterogeneous pattern of secondary genetic events.
