abstract: Unknown primary adenocarcinoma UPA comprises a group of heterogeneous cancers
  of great clinical and biological interest. UPA presents as metastatic disease without
  a detectable primary site after medical workup. Here we investigated whether or
  not a clonal relationship exists between multiple tumors within individual UPA patients.
  A molecular resemblance would argue for an early clonal outgrowth of tumor cells
  from the primary lesion, a mutual feature observed within this group of neoplasms.
  In 14 patients with UPA multiple tumors, obtained at autopsy, were analyzed by molecular
  allelotyping and immunohistochemistry. In addition, tumors of 4 patients could be
  analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Similar genetic and phenotypic
  profiles were used as indicator for a clonal relationship, whereas different profiles
  implicate independent tumors. The molecular data indicated that the multiple lesions
  in the 14 UPA patients, including the primary tumors, are clonally related. In agreement
  with the theory of tumor progression, some metastatic lesions showed additional
  genetic alterations besides the characteristics that were shared with the primary
  tumor. Furthermore, 8 UPA patients had tumors with a high frequency of allelic loss
  and or imbalance FALI 43-71 , while 6 patients demonstrated a lower FALI 14-29 ,
  suggesting the occurrence of chromosomal instability in the former group. Our data
  provide molecular evidence for a clonal relationship between multiple metastases
  and the primary tumor within individual UPA patients, independent of the anatomical
  origin of the cancer. This finding is in agreement with the suggestion that tumor
  progression is rapid in UPA patients, limiting the chance of clonal divergence.
  The identification of 2 groups of UPAs with either a high or low FALI indicates
  that chromosomal instability is not the only driving force behind early tumor cell
  dissemination. Thus, other molecular mechanisms must underlie the common biology
  of these tumors.
