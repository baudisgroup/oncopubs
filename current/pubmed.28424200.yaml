abstract: 'Although most human cancers display a single histology, there are unusual
  cases where two or more distinct tissue types present within a primary tumor. One
  such example is metaplastic breast carcinoma, a rare but aggressive cancer with
  a heterogenous histology, including squamous, chondroid, and spindle cells. Metaplastic
  carcinomas often contain an admixed conventional ductal invasive or in situ mammary
  carcinoma component, and are typically triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone
  receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification/overexpression.
  An unanswered question is the origin of metaplastic breast cancers. While they may
  arise independently from their ductal components, their close juxtaposition favors
  a model that postulates a shared origin, either as two derivatives from the same
  primary cancer, or one histology as an outgrowth of the other. Understanding the
  mechanism of development of these tumors may inform clinical decisions.<br /><br
  />Experimental Design: We performed exome sequencing for paired metaplastic and
  adjacent conventional invasive ductal carcinomas in eight patients and created a
  pipeline to identify somatic variants and predict their functional impact, without
  having normal tissue. We then determined the genetic relationships between the histologically
  distinct compartments.<br /><br />Results: In each case, the tumor components have
  nearly identical landscapes of somatic mutation, implying that the differing histologies
  do not derive from genetic clonal divergence.<br /><br />Conclusions: A shared origin
  for tumors with differing histologies suggests that epigenetic or noncoding changes
  may mediate the metaplastic phenotype, and that alternative therapeutic approaches,
  including epigenetic therapies, may be required for metaplastic breast cancers.'
