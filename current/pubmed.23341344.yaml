abstract: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL is an aggressive and heterogeneous
  disease. The diagnosis is predominantly based on immunophenotyping. In addition
  to known cytogenetic abnormalities molecular mutations were recently identified.
  Here, 90 adult T-ALL cases were investigated for mutations in NOTCH1, FBXW7, PHF6,
  CDKN2A, DNMT3A, FLT3, PTEN, and RUNX1 using 454 next-generation amplicon sequencing
  and melting curve analyses. These data were further complemented by FISH, chromosome
  banding, array CGH, and CDKN2B promoter methylation analyses. NOTCH1 was the most
  frequently mutated gene with a 71.1 frequency followed by FBXW7 18.9 , PHF6 39.5
  , DNMT3A 17.8 , RUNX1 15.5 , PTEN 10.0 , CDKN2A 4.4 , FLT3-ITD 2.2 , and FLT3-TKD
  1.1 . In total, 84 90 93.3 cases harbored at least one mutation. Combining these
  data with CDKN2A B deletions and CDKN2B methylation status, we detected minimum
  one aberration in 89 90 98.9 patients. Survival analyses revealed the subtype as
  defined by the immunophenotype as the strongest independent prognostic factor. When
  restricting the survival analysis to the early T-ALL subtype, a strong association
  of RUNX1 P 0.027 and DNMT3A P 0.005 mutations with shorter overall survival was
  observed. In conclusion, RUNX1 and DNMT3A are frequently mutated in T-ALL and are
  associated with poor prognosis in early T-ALL.
