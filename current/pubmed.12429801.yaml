abstract: Frequent chromosome 1 abnormalities detected in human hepatocellular carcinoma
  have been implicated in early genetic events of liver carcinogenesis. Recurrent
  loss of 1p with a common deleted region 1p36-p34 has been reported from microsatellite
  analysis, whereas common gain of the whole chromosome q-arm was described from several
  comparative genomic hybridization studies. The relationships between copy number
  changes and allelic status however remains unclear. In this study, we have conducted
  a simultaneous comparative genomic hybridization and microsatellite analysis study
  on chromosome 1 in 31 hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Microsatellite analysis revealed
  frequent loss of heterozygosity on 1p at loci D1S468 74 , D1S450 67 , D1S2667 65
  , D1S2697 75 , D1S199 52 , and D1S234 67 corresponded to the distal 1p36 region
  and coincided with 12 cases 86 that presented losses on 1p by comparative genomic
  hybridization analysis. Although comparative genomic hybridization indicated a common
  deleted region of 1p36-p35 in the current series, microsatellite analysis has refined
  the smallest overlapping region SOR to 1p36.13-p36.22. Gain of 1q as revealed by
  comparative genomic hybridization suggested low and high-level gains, and cases
  that displayed an amplicon below the heterochromatic region 1q21-q25. Common allelic
  imbalances of polymorphic markers D1S2635 64 , D1S484 67 , D1S2878 65 , D1S196 70
  , D1S249 64 D1S2785 75 , D1S2842 73 and D1S2836 74 that corresponded to the regions
  1q23.1-q24.2, 1q32.1 and 1q43-q44 were detected. Three distinct regions of allelic
  imbalances were thus suggested on recurring 1q gain found in hepatocellular carcinoma.
  Furthermore, microsatellite analysis has enabled a mapping of common overrepresented
  regions and suggested SOR on 1q23.1-q23.3 D1S2635-D1S2878 , 1q25.1-q31.1 D1S452-D1S238
  , and 1q43 D1S2785-D1S2842 . Our current study has refined chromosome 1 aberrations
  in hepatocellular carcinoma to four regions of allelic imbalances. The SORs delineated
  should provide basis for further molecular investigation in hepatocarcinogenesis
  on genes residing on these chromosomal regions.
