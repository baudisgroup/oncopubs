abstract: Rhabdomyosarcoma RMS in children occurs predominantly as two major histologically
  defined subtypes called embryonal RMS RMS-E and the prognostically less favorable
  alveolar RMS RMS-A . Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was performed on 21 RMS
  and identified consistent gains affecting chromosomes 2 8 10 , 5 5 10 , 6 3 10 ,
  7 7 10 , 8 9 10 , 11 6 10 , and 12 5 10 in RMS-E. Losses deletions involved chromosomes
  19 2 10 and chromosomes 4, 9, 10, 17, 21 1 10 each . High copy number amplification,
  involving the 2p24 region 5 11 and less frequently, the 12q13-21 2 11 , 9p22 1 11
  , and 17q22-25 1 11 regions, was detected in RMS-A. Gene amplification at band 2p24
  was present in 6 12 alveolar tumors, and in each case, MYCN was amplified, together
  with the distally placed DDX1 gene. For these patients there was a shorter disease
  free interval and a higher mortality than patients with tumors without amplification.
  Detailed spectral karyotype analysis SKY was performed on two RMS cell lines one
  of each subtype and identified a surprisingly high level of structural change. Gene
  expression studies with the Atlas Human Cancer Array 588 genes showed that 153 genes
  generated a signal of similar intensity in both cell lines, and 45 genes appeared
  to have subtype-specific expression. The chromosomal location of differentially
  expressed genes was compared to the pattern of genomic alteration in RMS as determined
  by CGH in this study and the literature.
