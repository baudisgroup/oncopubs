abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH reveals DNA sequence copy number changes
  that are shared among the different cell subpopulations present in a tumor and may
  help to delineate the average progression pathways of breast cancer. Previous CGH
  studies of breast cancer have concentrated on selected subgroups of breast cancer.
  Here, 55 unselected primary breast carcinomas were analyzed using optimized quality-controlled
  CGH procedures. Gains of 1q 67 and 8q 49 were the most frequent aberrations. Other
  recurrent gains were found at 33 chromosomal regions, with 16p, 5p12-14, 19q, 11q13-14,
  17q12, 17q22-24, 19p, and 20q13 being most often amp gt 18 involved. Losses found
  in amp gt 18 of the tumors involved 8p, 16q, 13q, 17p, 9p, Xq, 6q, 11q, and 18q.
  The total number of aberrations per tumor was highest in poorly differentiated P
  0.01 and in DNA aneuploid P 0.05 tumors. The high frequency of 1q gains and presence
  of 1q as the sole abnormality suggest that it is an early genetic event. In contrast,
  gains of 8q were most common in genetically and phenotypically advanced breast cancers.
  The vast majority of breast cancers 80 have gains of 1q, 8q, or both, and 3 changes
  1q, 8q, or -13q account for 91 of the tumors. In conclusion, CGH results indicate
  that certain chromosomal imbalances are very often selected for, sometimes in a
  preferential order, during the progression of breast cancer. Further studies of
  such common changes may form the basis for a molecular cytogenetic classification
  of breast cancer.
