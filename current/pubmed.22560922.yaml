abstract: 'Since multiple lung cancer treatment strategies differ, it is essential
  for clinicians to be able to distinguish between separate primary lesions and metastasis.
  In the present study, we used array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and somatic
  mutation epidermal growth factor receptor: EGFR to analyze genomic alteration profiles
  in lung cancer patients. To validate the consistency among the pathological assessments
  and clarify the clinical differences between double primary lesions and metastasis,
  we also examined synchronous double lung cancer clinical data.'
