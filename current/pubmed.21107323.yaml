abstract: Activating B-RAF V600E also known as BRAF kinase mutations occur in 7 of
  human malignancies and 60 of melanomas. Early clinical experience with a novel class
  I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80 anti-tumour
  response rate among patients with B-RAF V600E -positive melanomas, but acquired
  drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms
  of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF
  V600E , MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here
  we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFR
  also known as PDGFRB upregulation or N-RAS also known as NRAS mutations but not
  through secondary mutations in B-RAF V600E . We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines
  artificially derived from B-RAF V600E -positive melanoma cell lines and validated
  key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures
  from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFR RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation
  emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma
  sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFR -upregulated
  tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not
  reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated
  N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon
  PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFR or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective
  PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFR or N-RAS Q61K conferred PLX4032
  resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation
  predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF V600E targeting
  not through secondary B-RAF V600E mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase RTK
  -mediated activation of alternative survival pathway s or activated RAS-mediated
  reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.
