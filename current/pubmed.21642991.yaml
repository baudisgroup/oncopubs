abstract: Malignant pleural mesotheliomas MPMs often show CDKN2A and NF2 inactivation,
  but other highly recurrent mutations have not been described. To identify additional
  driver genes, we used an integrated genomic analysis of 53 MPM tumor samples to
  guide a focused sequencing effort that uncovered somatic inactivating mutations
  in BAP1 in 23 of MPMs. The BAP1 nuclear deubiquitinase is known to target histones
  together with ASXL1 as a Polycomb repressor subunit and the HCF1 transcriptional
  co-factor, and we show that BAP1 knockdown in MPM cell lines affects E2F and Polycomb
  target genes. These findings implicate transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis
  of MPM.
