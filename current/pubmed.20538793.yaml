abstract: We performed single-molecule telomere length and telomere fusion analysis
  in patients at different stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . Our work identified
  the shortest telomeres ever recorded in primary human tissue, reinforcing the concept
  that there is significant cell division in CLL. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence
  that critical telomere shortening, dysfunction, and fusion contribute to disease
  progression. The frequency of short telomeres and fusion events increased with advanced
  disease, but importantly these were also found in a subset of early-stage patient
  samples, indicating that these events can precede disease progression. Sequence
  analysis of fusion events isolated from persons with the shortest telomeres revealed
  limited numbers of repeats at the breakpoint, subtelomeric deletion, and microhomology.
  Array-comparative genome hybridization analysis of persons displaying evidence of
  telomere dysfunction revealed large-scale genomic rearrangements that were concentrated
  in the telomeric regions this was not observed in samples with longer telomeres.
  The telomere dynamics observed in CLL B cells were indistinguishable from that observed
  in cells undergoing crisis in culture after abrogation of the p53 pathway. Taken
  together, our data support the concept that telomere erosion and subsequent telomere
  fusion are critical in the progression of CLL and that this paradigm may extend
  to other malignancies.
