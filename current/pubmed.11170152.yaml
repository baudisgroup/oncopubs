abstract: Germline mutations in recessive cancer predisposition genes are uncovered
  by somatic genetic deletions during tumor development. Analysis of genetic changes
  in tumor tissues from patients with an inherited predisposition may therefore highlight
  regions of the genome containing susceptibility or modifier genes. Our aim was to
  characterize genetic changes in familial prostate cancer
