abstract: 'No objective parameters have been found so far that can predict the biological
  behavior of early stages of prostatic cancer, which are encountered frequently nowadays
  due to surveillance and screening programs. We have applied comparative genomic
  hybridization to routinely processed, paraffin-embedded radical prostatectomy specimens
  derived from patients who participated in the European Randomized Study of Screening
  for Prostate Cancer. We defined a panel consisting of 36 early cancer specimens:
  13 small total tumor volume Tv amp lt 0.5 ml carcinomas and 23 intermediate Tv between
  0.5-1.0 ml tumors. These samples were compared with a set of 16 locally advanced,
  large Tv amp gt 2.0 ml tumor samples, not derived from the European Randomized Study
  of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Chromosome arms that frequently ie, amp gt or
  15 showed loss in the small tumors included 13q 31 , 6q 23 , and Y 15 , whereas
  frequent ie, amp gt or 15 gain was seen of 20q 15 . In the intermediate cancers,
  loss was detected of 8p 35 , 16q 30 , 5q 26 , Y 22 , 6q, and 18q both 17 . No consistent
  gains were found in this group. In the large tumors, loss was seen of 13q 69 , 8p
  50 , 5q, 6q both 31 , and Y 15 . Gains were observed of 8q 37 , 3q 25 , 7p, 7q,
  9q, and Xq all 19 . Comparison of these early, localized tumors with large adenocarcinomas
  showed a significant increase in the number of aberrant chromosomes per case Rs
  0.36, P 0.009 . The same was true for the number of lost or gained chromosomes per
  case Rs 0.27, P: 0.05 Rs 0.48, respectively P amp lt 0.001 . Interestingly, chromosomal
  alterations that were found in previous studies to be potential biomarkers for tumor
  aggressiveness, ie, gain of 7pq and or 8q, were already distinguished in the small
  and intermediate cancers. In conclusion, our data show that chromosomal losses,
  more specifically of 6q and 13q, are early events in prostatic tumorigenesis, whereas
  chromosomal gains, especially of 8q, appear to be late events in prostatic tumor
  development. Finally, early localized tumors, as detected by screening programs,
  harbor cancers with aggressive genetic characteristics.'
