abstract: If properly translated to clinical use, our knowledge about biomarkers may
  lead to a more effective way of combating colorectal cancer CRC . Biomarkers are
  biomolecular, genetic, or cytogenetic attributes indicative of the diseases progression,
  predisposition, prognosis, or therapeutic options. For CRC, these include chromosomal
  instability, mutations in KRAS and TP53, loss of 18q, and elevated level of carcinoembryonic
  antigen CEA , which are all associated with poor prognosis. The prognostic significance
  of 18q loss can be attributed to reduced expression of SMAD4, or DCC, although the
  chromosomal arm is actually heavily populated by genes whose downregulation correlate
  to worse survival. Potentially, identification of prognostic biomarkers can help
  the oncologist decide whether adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary after surgery.
  Testing for therapeutic biomarkers can be necessary if targeted therapeutics are
  being considered. The identification of highly penetrant predisposition markers
  such as mutations in APC and MLH1 can be a lifesaver for carrier individuals, who
  would then have to undergo colonoscopy at an earlier age. Even sporadic CRCs may
  have some hereditary components, according to recent studies. Genome-wide association
  studies using SNP arrays showed that polymorphisms of certain genes can have subtle
  influence on CRC predisposition. Our own SNP array-based analysis suggested that
  long stretches of germline homozygosity autozygosity , indicative of consanguinity,
  may also factor in CRC predisposition.
