abstract: T cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas with
  poor prognosis, and whose genetic alterations are not well understood. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH is a technique that allows the identification of DNA imbalances
  without cytogenetic studies. We have studied 37 samples from 29 T cell non-Hodgkins
  lymphomas 25 peripheral and four lymphoblastic lymphomas by CGH in order to detect
  DNA sequence copy number changes of putative importance in the biology and prognosis
  of these neoplasms. We detected abnormal CGH profiles in 16 27 59 of samples at
  diagnosis, a ratio that increased to 66 23 37 when we included the relapsed samples.
  The most common recurrent changes were gains related to the X chromosome, either
  the whole chromosome or partially the Xq26-27 bands 19 . Other recurrent changes
  included gains of bands 9q34, gains of chromosomes 17, 19, and 20, and complete
  or partial deletions of chromosome 13 10 . Cancer-related genes located at Xq26-28
  region were analyzed by Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH
  . Low level amplification of some of these genes was detected by this technique
  confirming the results obtained by CGH in this region. The detection of abnormal
  CGH profiles in these T cell lymphomas could have clinical implications. Patients
  with abnormal CGH profiles showed significant associations with advanced stage of
  disease, overexpression of P53, and higher proliferative index.
