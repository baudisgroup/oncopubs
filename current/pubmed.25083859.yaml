abstract: Lymph-node metastasis (LNM) predict high recurrence rates in breast cancer
  patients. Systemic treatment aims to eliminate (micro)metastatic cells. However
  decisions regarding systemic treatment depend largely on clinical and molecular
  characteristics of primary tumours. It remains, however, unclear to what extent
  metastases resemble the cognate primary breast tumours, especially on a genomic
  level, and as such will be eradicated by the systemic therapy chosen. In this study
  we used high-resolution aCGH to investigate DNA copy number differences between
  primary breast cancers and their paired LNMs. To date, no recurrent LNM-specific
  genomic aberrations have been identified using array comparative genomic hybridization
  (aCGH) analysis. In our study we employ a high-resolution platform and we stratify
  on different breast cancer subtypes, both aspects that might have underpowered previously
  performed studies.To test the possibility that genomic instability in triple-negative
  breast cancers (TNBCs) might cause increased random and potentially also recurrent
  copy number aberrations (CNAs) in their LNMs, we studied 10 primary TNBC-LNM pairs
  and 10 ER-positive (ER+) pairs and verified our findings adding additionally 5 TNBC-LNM
  and 22 ER+-LNM pairs. We found that all LNMs clustered nearest to their matched
  tumour except for two cases, of which one was due to the presence of two distinct
  histological components in one tumour. We found no significantly altered CNAs between
  tumour and their LNMs in the entire group or in the subgroups. Within the TNBC subgroup,
  no absolute increase in CNAs was found in the LNMs compared to their primary tumours,
  suggesting that increased genomic instability does not lead to more CNAs in LNMs.
  Our findings suggest a high clonal relationship between primary breast tumours and
  its LNMs, at least prior to treatment, and support the use of primary tumour characteristics
  to guide adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
