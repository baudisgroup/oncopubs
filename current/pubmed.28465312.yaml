abstract: The scientific community has avoided using tissue samples from patients
  that have been exposed to systemic chemotherapy to infer the genomic landscape of
  a given cancer. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a heterogeneous, chemoresistant tumor
  for which the availability and size of pretreatment endoscopic samples are limiting.
  This study compares whole-genome sequencing data obtained from chemo-naive and chemo-treated
  samples. The quality of whole-genomic sequencing data is comparable across all samples
  regardless of chemotherapy status. Inclusion of samples collected post-chemotherapy
  increased the proportion of late-stage tumors. When comparing matched pre- and post-chemotherapy
  samples from 10 cases, the mutational signatures, copy number, and SNV mutational
  profiles reflect the expected heterogeneity in this disease. Analysis of SNVs in
  relation to allele-specific copy-number changes pinpoints the common ancestor to
  a point prior to chemotherapy. For cases in which pre- and post-chemotherapy samples
  do show substantial differences, the timing of the divergence is near-synchronous
  with endoreduplication. Comparison across a large prospective cohort (62 treatment-naive,
  58 chemotherapy-treated samples) reveals no significant differences in the overall
  mutation rate, mutation signatures, specific recurrent point mutations, or copy-number
  events in respect to chemotherapy status. In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing
  of samples obtained following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is representative of the
  genomic landscape of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Excluding these samples reduces
  the material available for cataloging and introduces a bias toward the earlier stages
  of cancer.
