abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is a frequent and aggressive cancer
  type. Gene amplifications, a known activating mechanism of oncogenes, target the
  3q26-qter region as one of the most frequently gained/amplified genomic sites in
  SCC of various types. Here, we used array comparative genomic hybridization to delineate
  the consensus region of 3q26.3 amplifications in lung SCC. Recurrent amplifications
  occur in 20% of lung SCC (136 tumors in total) and map to a core region of 2 Mb
  (Megabases) that encompasses SOX2, a transcription factor gene. Intense SOX2 immunostaining
  is frequent in nuclei of lung SCC, indicating potential active transcriptional regulation
  by SOX2. Analyses of the transcriptome of lung SCC, SOX2-overexpressing lung epithelial
  cells and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) reveal that SOX2 contributes to activate ESC-like
  phenotypes and provide clues pertaining to the deregulated genes involved in the
  malignant phenotype. In cell culture experiments, overexpression of SOX2 stimulates
  cellular migration and anchorage-independent growth while SOX2 knockdown impairs
  cell growth. Finally, SOX2 over-expression in non-tumorigenic human lung bronchial
  epithelial cells is tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. These results indicate
  that the SOX2 transcription factor, a major regulator of stem cell function, is
  also an oncogene and a driver gene for the recurrent 3q26.33 amplifications in lung
  SCC.
