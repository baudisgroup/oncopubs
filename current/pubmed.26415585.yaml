abstract: "SÃ©zary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukaemia of mature T cells with
  poor prognosis and limited options for targeted therapies. The comprehensive genetic
  alterations underlying the pathogenesis of SS are unknown. Here we integrate whole-genome
  sequencing (n=6), whole-exome sequencing (n=66) and array comparative genomic hybridization-based
  copy-number analysis (n=80) of primary SS samples. We identify previously unknown
  recurrent loss-of-function aberrations targeting members of the chromatin remodelling/histone
  modification and trithorax families, including ARID1A in which functional loss from
  nonsense and frameshift mutations and/or targeted deletions is observed in 40.3%
  of SS genomes. We also identify recurrent gain-of-function mutations targeting PLCG1
  (9%) and JAK1, JAK3, STAT3 and STAT5B (JAK/STAT total â\x88¼11%). Functional studies
  reveal sensitivity of JAK1-mutated primary SS cells to JAK inhibitor treatment.
  These results highlight the complex genomic landscape of SS and a role for inhibition
  of JAK/STAT pathways for the treatment of SS."
