abstract: Barrett's esophagus is thought to progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma
  (EAC) through a stepwise progression with loss of CDKN2A followed by TP53 inactivation
  and aneuploidy. Here we present whole-exome sequencing from 25 pairs of EAC and
  Barrett's esophagus and from 5 patients whose Barrett's esophagus and tumor were
  extensively sampled. Our analysis showed that oncogene amplification typically occurred
  as a late event and that TP53 mutations often occurred early in Barrett's esophagus
  progression, including in non-dysplastic epithelium. Reanalysis of additional EAC
  exome data showed that the majority (62.5%) of EACs emerged following genome doubling
  and that tumors with genomic doubling had different patterns of genomic alterations,
  with more frequent oncogenic amplification and less frequent inactivation of tumor
  suppressors, including CDKN2A. These data suggest that many EACs emerge not through
  the gradual accumulation of tumor-suppressor alterations but rather through a more
  direct path whereby a TP53-mutant cell undergoes genome doubling, followed by the
  acquisition of oncogenic amplifications.
