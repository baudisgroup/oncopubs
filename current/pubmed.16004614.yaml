abstract: Chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization CGH has been applied to all
  stages of cervical carcinoma progression, defining a specific pattern of chromosomal
  imbalances in this tumor. However, given its limited spatial resolution, chromosomal
  CGH has offered only general information regarding the possible genetic targets
  of DNA copy number changes.
