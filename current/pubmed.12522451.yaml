abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH and multiplex-fluorescence in situ
  hybridization M-FISH were used to evaluate the presentation karyotype in 15 and
  18 patients respectively, aged amp gt 60 years, with acute myeloid leukemia AML
  . Conventional G-banded analysis was performed in all patients prior to evaluation.
  Comparative genomic hybridization confirmed the G-banded karyotype fully in 12 patients
  and partially in two patients. Normal CGH profiles were observed in patients with
  a normal karyotype and in one patient with a balanced chromosomal translocation
  as the sole cytogenetic aberration. Multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization
  provided additional information in two patients with a complex karyotype, but failed
  to detect a telomeric translocation in one patient. Eight patients with normal G-banded
  karyotypes appeared normal by M-FISH. These results demonstrate that both CGH and
  M-FISH analysis correlate well with the G-banded karyotype in AML. Furthermore,
  although additive cytogenetic data was not provided by either technique in cases
  with normal karyotype, DNA copy number change and cryptic translocations below the
  resolution of CGH and M-FISH may still be the initiating event for leukemogenesis
  for these patients.
