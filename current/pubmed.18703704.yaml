abstract: The secondary genetic events associated with follicular lymphoma FL progression
  are not well defined. We applied genome-wide BAC array comparative genomic hybridization
  to 106 diagnostic biopsies of FL to characterize regional genomic imbalances. Using
  an analytical approach that defined regions of copy number change as intersections
  between visual annotations and a Hidden Markov model-based algorithm, we identified
  71 regional alterations that were recurrent in at least 10 of cases. These ranged
  in size from approximately 200 kb to 44 Mb, affecting chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8,
  10, 12, 17, 18, 19, and 22. We also demonstrated by cluster analysis that 46.2 of
  the 106 cases could be sub-grouped based on the presence of 1q, 6p 6q-, 7, or 18.
  Survival analysis showed that 21 of the 71 regions correlated significantly with
  inferior overall survival OS . Of these 21 regions, 16 were independent predictors
  of OS using a multivariate Cox model that included the international prognostic
  index IPI score. Two of these 16 regions 1p36.22-p36.33 and 6q21-q24.3 were also
  predictors of transformation risk and independent of IPI. These prognostic features
  may be useful to identify high-risk patients as candidates for risk-adapted therapies.
