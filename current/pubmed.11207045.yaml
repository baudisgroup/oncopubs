abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify novel areas of genomic copy number
  change associated with transformation from follicular lymphoma FL to diffuse large
  B cell lymphoma DLBL . DNA was extracted from tumour cells micro-dissected from
  paraffin- embedded tissue sections in 24 patients with FL and subsequent transformation
  to DLBL and 18 patients with de novo DLBL. Tumour DNA was compared to reference
  DNA using comparative genomic hybridization. Abnormalities common to all 3 groups
  were gains on chromosomes 4q, 5q, 7q, 11q and X and losses on 3p, 8p and 10q. Copy
  number changes seen in both transformed and de novo DLBL and not seen in FL were
  gains on 2p and losses on 1q, 15q and Xq. Gains on 2q, 6p, 7p and 17q and losses
  on 5p and 8q were specific to transformed DLBL cases. Gain on 12q12-14 was found
  in 52 of the transformed DLBL cases and was never seen in its follicular counterpart.
  Patterns of genomic copy number change associated with specific clinical events
  in NHL have been demonstrated and suggest that gains on 2q, 6p, 7p, 12q and 17q
  and losses on 5p and 8q may be important in the transformation from low to high-grade
  disease.
