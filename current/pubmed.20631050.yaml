abstract: Double minutes dmin and homogeneously staining regions hsr are the cytogenetic
  hallmarks of genomic amplification in cancer. Different mechanisms have been proposed
  to explain their genesis. Recently, our group showed that the MYC-containing dmin
  in leukemia cases arise by excision and amplification episome model . In the present
  paper we investigated 10 cell lines from solid tumors showing MYCN amplification
  as dmin or hsr. Particularly revealing results were provided by the two subclones
  of the neuroblastoma cell line STA-NB-10, one showing dmin-only and the second hsr-only
  amplification. Both subclones showed a deletion, at 2p24.3, whose extension matched
  the amplicon extension. Additionally, the amplicon structure of the dmin and hsr
  forms was identical. This strongly argues that the episome model, already demonstrated
  in leukemias, applies to solid tumors as well, and that dmin and hsr are two faces
  of the same coin. The organization of the duplicated segments varied from very simple
  no apparent changes from the normal sequence to very complex. MYCN was always overexpressed
  significantly overexpressed in three cases . The fusion junctions, always mediated
  by nonhomologous end joining, occasionally juxtaposed truncated genes in the same
  transcriptional orientation. Fusion transcripts involving NBAS also known as NAG
  , FAM49A, BC035112 also known as NCRNA00276 , and SMC6 genes were indeed detected,
  although their role in the context of the tumor is not clear.
