abstract: Small-cell lung cancer SCLC represents a group of highly malignant tumors
  giving rise to early and widespread metastases. We used comparative genomic hybridization
  in autoptic tumor specimens from 10 patients to discover genetic alterations that
  are associated with tumor progression and potentially with the metastatic phenotype.
  Ten primary SCLC and 16 corresponding metastases were investigated with a maximum
  of 4 tumors per case. Prevalent changes observed in more than 60 of the primary
  tumors and their metastases included deletions on chromosomes 3p, 4q, 5q, 10q, 13q
  and 17p, and DNA over-representations on chromosomes 3q and 5p. The number of common
  alterations in the primary tumors and the related metastases outnumbered the differences,
  indicating a clonal relationship. Within the lesions of the same patient, differences
  were found between the primary tumor and the metastases as well as between metastases
  of distinct organ sites. However, no specific alteration was significantly associated
  with the metastatic phenotype. We suggest that the high malignancy of SCLC is defined
  by the above-mentioned pattern of aberrations.
