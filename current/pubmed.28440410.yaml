abstract: Oral cancer is a serious disease caused by environmental factors and/or
  susceptible genes. In the present study, in order to identify useful genetic biomarkers
  for cancer prediction and prevention, and for personalized treatment, we detected
  somatic mutations in 5ï¿½pairs of oral cancer tissues and blood samples using whole
  exome sequencingï¿½(WES). Finally, we confirmed a novel nonsense single-nucleotide
  polymorphismï¿½(SNP; chr19:15288426A>C) in the NOTCH3 gene with sanger sequencing,
  which resulted in a N1438T mutation in the protein sequence. Using multiple inï¿½silico
  analyses, this variant was found to mildly damaging effects on the NOTCH3 gene,
  which was supported by the results from analyses using PANTHER, SNAP and SNPs&GO.
  However, further analysis using Mutation Taster revealed that this SNP had a probability
  ofï¿½0.9997 to be 'disease causing'. In addition, we performed 3Dï¿½structure simulation
  analysis and the results suggested that this variant had little effect on the solubility
  and hydrophobicity of the protein and thus on its function; however, it decreased
  the stability of the protein by increasing the total energy following minimizationï¿½(-1,051.39ï¿½kcal/mol
  for the mutant and -1,229.84ï¿½kcal/mol for the native) and decreasing one stabilizing
  residue of the protein. Less stability of the N1438T mutant was also supported by
  analysis using I-Mutant with a DDG value ofï¿½-1.67. Overall, the present study
  identified and confirmed a novel mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, which may decrease
  the stability of NOTCH3, and may thus prove to be helpful in cancer prognosis.
