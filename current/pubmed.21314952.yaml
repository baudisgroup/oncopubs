abstract: Paclitaxel is a microtubule-stabilizing drug that has been commonly used
  in treating cancer. Due to genetic heterogeneity within patient populations, therapeutic
  response rates often vary. Here we used the NCI60 panel to identify SNPs associated
  with paclitaxel sensitivity. Using the panels GI50 response data available from
  Developmental Therapeutics Program, cell lines were categorized as either sensitive
  or resistant. PLINK software was used to perform a genome-wide association analysis
  of the cellular response to paclitaxel with the panels SNP-genotype data on the
  Affymetrix 125 k SNP array. FastSNP software helped predict each SNPs potential
  impact on their gene product. mRNA expression differences between sensitive and
  resistant cell lines was examined using data from BioGPS. Using Haploview software,
  we investigated for haplotypes that were more strongly associated with the cellular
  response to paclitaxel. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software helped us understand
  how our identified genes may alter the cellular response to paclitaxel.
