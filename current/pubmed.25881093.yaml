abstract: The extent to which metastatic tumors further evolve by accumulating additional
  mutations is unclear and has yet to be addressed extensively using next-generation
  sequencing of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.  Eleven spatially separated tumor
  samples from the primary tumor and associated metastatic sites and two normal samples
  were obtained from a Stage IIIC ovarian cancer patient during cytoreductive surgery
  prior to chemotherapy. Whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis were performed.
  Omental exomes were sequenced with a high depth of coverage to thoroughly explore
  the variants in metastatic lesions. Somatic mutations were further validated by
  ultra-deep targeted sequencing to sort out false positives and false negatives.
  Based on the somatic mutations and copy number variation profiles, a phylogenetic
  tree was generated to explore the evolutionary relationship among tumor samples.  Only
  6% of the somatic mutations were present in every sample of a given case with TP53
  as the only known mutant gene consistently present in all samples. Two non-spatial
  clusters of primary tumors (cluster P1 and P2), and a cluster of metastatic regions
  (cluster M) were identified. The patterns of mutations indicate that cluster P1
  and P2 diverged in the early phase of tumorigenesis, and that metastatic cluster
  M originated from the common ancestral clone of cluster P1 with few somatic mutations
  and copy number variations.  Although a high level of intratumor heterogeneity was
  evident in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, our results suggest that transcoelomic
  metastasis arises with little accumulation of somatic mutations and copy number
  alterations in this patient.
