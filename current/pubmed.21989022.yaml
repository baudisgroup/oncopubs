abstract: Germline mutations in either of the two tumor-suppressor genes, BRCA1 and
  BRCA2, account for a significant proportion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
  cases. Most of these mutations consist of deletions, insertions, nonsense mutations,
  and splice variants, however an increasing number of large genomic rearrangements
  have been identified in these genes.
