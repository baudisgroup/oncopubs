abstract: To better understand the implications of genomic instability and outcome
  in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL , we sought to address genomic complexity
  as a predictor of chemosensitivity and ultimately clinical outcome in this disease.
  We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH with a one-million probe
  array and identified gains and losses of genetic material in 48 patients treated
  on a chemoimmunotherapy clinical trial. We identified chromosomal gain or loss in
  6 of the patients on chromosomes 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 17. Higher genomic
  complexity, as a mechanism favoring clonal selection, was associated with shorter
  progression-free survival, and predicted a poor response to treatment. Of interest,
  CLL cases with loss of p53 surveillance showed more complex genomic features and
  were found both in patients with a 17p13.1 deletion and in the more favorable genetic
  subtype characterized by the presence of 13q14.1 deletion. This aCGH study adds
  information on the association between poor trial response and increasing genetic
  complexity as CLL progresses.
