abstract: There is a growing appreciation of the role that epigenetic alterations
  can play in oncogenesis. However, given the large number of genetic anomalies present
  in most cancers, it has been difficult to evaluate the extent to which epigenetic
  changes contribute to cancer. SNF5 INI1 SMARCB1 BAF47 is a tumor suppressor that
  regulates the epigenome as a core member of the SWI SNF chromatin remodeling complex.
  While the SWI SNF complex displays potent tumor suppressor activity, it is unknown
  whether this activity is exerted genetically via maintenance of genome integrity
  or epigenetically via transcriptional regulation. Here we show that Snf5-deficient
  primary cells do not show altered sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, defects in
  gamma-H2AX induction, or an abrogated DNA damage checkpoint. Further, the aggressive
  malignancies that arise following SNF5 loss are diploid and genomically stable.
  Remarkably, we demonstrate that most human SNF5-deficient cancers lack genomic amplifications
  deletions and, aside from SNF5 loss, are indistinguishable from normal cells on
  single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Finally, we show that epigenetically based
  changes in transcription that occur following SNF5 loss correlate with the tumor
  phenotype. Collectively, our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms of
  oncogenesis by demonstrating that disruption of a chromatin remodeling complex can
  largely, if not completely, substitute for genomic instability in the genesis of
  aggressive cancer.
