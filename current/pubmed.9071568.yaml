abstract: Neuroblastoma tumors show a complex interaction of genetic abnormalities,
  among which some are of significant prognostic importance however, analysis of chromosome
  changes in this tumor is often unsuccessful. Twenty primary tumors were studied
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , and abnormalities were found in 19. While
  these changes included deletions of chromosome arm Ip 45 and MYCN oncogene amplification
  30 , gains of chromosome 17 material were much more frequent 75 . We also found
  evidence in two cases of a new amplification site at band 2p23.
