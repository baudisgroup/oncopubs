abstract: To more comprehensively assess the pathogenic contribution of the PTEN-PI3K-AKT
  pathway to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL , we examined diagnostic DNA
  samples from children with T-ALL using array comparative genomic hybridization and
  sequence analysis. Alterations of PTEN, PI3K, or AKT were identified in 47.7 of
  44 cases. There was a striking clustering of PTEN mutations in exon 7 in 12 cases,
  all of which were predicted to truncate the C2 domain without disrupting the phosphatase
  domain of PTEN. Induction chemotherapy failed to induce remission in 3 of the 4
  patients whose lymphoblasts harbored PTEN deletions at the time of diagnosis, compared
  with none of the 12 patients with mutations of PTEN exon 7 P .007 , suggesting that
  PTEN deletion has more adverse therapeutic consequences than mutational disruptions
  that preserve the phosphatase domain. These findings add significant support to
  the rationale for the development of therapies targeting the PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway
  in T-ALL.
