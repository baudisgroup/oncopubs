abstract: Colorectal cancer CRC is a major health concern worldwide, and recently
  becomes the most common cancer in Asia. The case collection of this study is one
  of the largest sets of CRC in Asia, and serves as representative data for investigating
  genomic differences between ethnic populations. We took comprehensive and high-resolution
  approaches to compare the clinicopathologic and genomic profiles of microsatellite
  instability MSI vs. microsatellite stability MSS in Taiwanese sporadic CRCs.
