abstract: Uveal melanoma UM is the most common primary intraocular tumor in the Western
  world. Cytogenetically, this tumor is characterized by typical chromosomal aberrations
  such as loss of 1p, 3, and 6q, and gain of 6p and 8q. Routinely, karyotyping and
  fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH on fresh tumor-biopsies are used to identify
  chromosomal changes. In addition, archival UM samples can be examined using comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH . In the presented study, we used CGH on a series of 46
  archival uveal melanomas to identify chromosomal changes. In 44 tumors aberrations
  were present and classic prognostic markers as loss of 1p 12 tumors, 26.1 , monosomy
  3 26 tumors, 56.5 , loss of 6q 10 tumors, 21.7 , and gain of chromosome arm 8q 27
  tumors, 58.7 were observed. Gain of chromosome arms 18q or 21q was found in three
  UMs. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification MLPA , a novel technique in
  UM, was performed to verify this low number of chromosome 18 and 21 abnormalities,
  but we could not confirm the previously reported gain of 18q11.2 and 21q11.2 as
  poor prognostic factors in UM.
