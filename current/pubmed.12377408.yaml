abstract: Prostate cancer CaP is a multifocal heterogenous disease. A major challenge
  in CaP research is to identify genetic biomarkers that herald aggressive transformation.
  To investigate the effect of tumor heterogeneity on the analysis of genomic aberration,
  we compared the results of comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis of DNA
  extracted from tumor bulk against that of DNA amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide
  primed polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR from homogeneous cell population obtained
  by laser capture microdissection of discrete tumor foci. Sampling by microdissection,
  aberrations were observed in three of three foci of carcinoma involved with prostatic
  capsule, and in two of three prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia PIN foci examined.
  Carcinoma foci consistently exhibited more extensive aberrations than the PIN samples
  obtained from the same tumor. Within these samples, the different tumor foci exhibited
  gain of 8q, whereas PIN showed no consistent aberration. Using bulk extracted DNA,
  CGH detected aberrations in only 3 of 21 samples investigated, despite the known
  trisomy 8 status, as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results
  of this study demonstrate that CGH analysis using bulk dissected fresh tissue is
  insufficiently sensitive to fully detect the chromosomal numerical aberrations in
  CaP. Given the considerable intratumor genomic heterogeneity, CGH with microdissection
  and DOP-PCR amplification provides a more complete repertoire of aberrations as
  well as a better phenotype-genotype correlation in prostate tumors.
