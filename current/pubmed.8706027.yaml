abstract: To identify recurrent chromosomal imbalances in pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
  27 tumors were analyzed by using comparative genomic hybridization. In 23 cases
  chromosomal imbalances were found. Gains of chromosomal material were much more
  frequent than losses. The most common overrepresentations were observed on chromosomes
  16p eight cases , 20q seven cases , 22q six cases , and 17q five cases and under-representations
  on a subregion of chromosome 9p eight cases . Distinct high-level amplifications
  were found on 1p32-p34, 6q24, 7q22, 12p13, and 22q. These data provide evidence
  for a number of new cytogenetically defined recurrent aberrations which are characteristic
  of pancreatic carcinoma. The overrepresented or underrepresented chromosomal regions
  represent candidate regions for potential oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes,
  respectively, possibly involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis.
