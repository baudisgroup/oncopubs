abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is a common and highly malignant tumor that
  is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Although the etiological factors associated are
  now well recognized, the interactions between individual factors and the molecular
  mechanisms by which they lead to cancer remain unclear. Cytogenetic analysis on
  HCC has been limited because of poor hepatocyte growth in vitro. The recently developed
  technique of comparative genomic hybridization CGH , however, permits screening
  of the entire genome without the need of cell culture. CGH was applied to the study
  of genomic aberrations in 67 surgically resected samples of HCC, 3 of adenomatous
  hyperplasia AH , and 12 of nontumorous cirrhotic liver surrounding the tumors. All
  samples were from patients of a racially and etiologically homogeneous population
  in Southern China, where chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the main etiological
  factor. CGH analysis of the HCC samples revealed frequent copy number gain of 1q
  48 67 cases, 72 , 8q 32 67 cases, 48 , 17q 20 67 cases, 30 , and 20q 25 67 cases,
  37 and common losses on 4q 29 67 cases, 43 , 8p 25 67 cases, 37 , 13q 25 67 cases,
  37 , and 16q 20 67 cases, 30 . Our finding of a high incidence of 1q gain strongly
  suggested this aberration was associated with the development of HCC. Genomic abnormalities
  were detected in 1 of the 3 AH specimens but absent in all 12 cirrhotic tissues
  surrounding the tumor. Clinical staging classified 3 67 HCC cases as T1, 53 cases
  as T2, and 11 cases as T3. No significant difference in the pattern of genomic imbalances
  was detected between stages T2 and T3. A significant copy number loss of 4q11-q23
  was, however, identified in those tumors larger than 3 cm in diameter. Of particular
  interest was the identification of 8q copy number gain in all 12 cases of HCC that
  arose in a noncirrhotic liver, compared with only 20 55 cases in HCC arising in
  a cirrhotic liver. We suggest that 8q over-representation is likely associated with
  a growth advantage and proliferative stimulation that have encouraged malignant
  changes in the noncirrhotic human liver.
