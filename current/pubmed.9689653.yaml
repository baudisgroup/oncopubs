abstract: Retroperitoneal paraganglioma is a rare tumor, especially occurring in childhood
  and adolescence, with a marked tendency to become biologically malignant. It has
  not been possible to predict the clinical outcome of paraganglioma patients by conventional
  histology, hence malignancy can only be demonstrated by the occurrence of metastatic
  lesions. Currently, only limited information on the genetics of this tumor is available.
  We report on a 16-year-old girl with a large retroperitoneal paraganglioma and an
  osseous metastasis to the first lumbar vertebra. In addition to morphological and
  immunohistochemical examinations, a molecular cytogenetic analysis was performed.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH revealed imbalanced chromosomal aberrations
  with a loss of chromosome 1p and a gain of 1q, indicating isochromosome 1q. A loss
  of chromosome 3 as well as low-level gains of chromosomes 4, 5, 6q, 11q and 13q
  were detected. A PCR-based microsatellite analysis of 1p confirmed the loss of heterozygosity,
  including NB1 and NB2 putative tumor-suppressor gene regions. Telomerase activity,
  which is found in the majority of malignant tumors, could not be detected. The case
  presented here is the first more comprehensive molecular genetic analysis of a sporadic
  malignant paraganglioma.
