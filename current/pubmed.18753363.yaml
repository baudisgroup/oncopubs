abstract: Anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC is a rare but highly aggressive disease with
  largely unexplained etiology and molecular pathogenesis. In this study, we analyzed
  genome-wide copy number changes, BRAF V-raf sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 mutations,
  and p16 and cyclin D1 expressions in a panel of ATC primary tumors. Three ATCs harbored
  the common BRAF mutation V600E. Using array-comparative genomic hybridisation array-CGH
  , several distinct recurrent copy number alterations were revealed including gains
  in 16p11.2, 20q11.2, and 20q13.12. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization
  revealed recurrent locus gain of UBCH10 in 20q13.12 and Cyclin D1 CCND1 in 11q13.
  The detection of a homozygous loss encompassing the CDKN2A locus in 9p21.3 motivated
  the examination of p16 protein expression, which was undetectable in 24 27 ATCs
  89 . Based on the frequent gain in 11q13 41 n 11 , the role of CCND1 was further
  investigated. Expression of cyclin D1 protein was observed at varying levels in
  18 27 ATCs 67 . The effect of CCND1 on thyroid cell proliferation was assessed in
  vitro in ATC cells by means of siRNA and in thyroid cells after CCND1 transfection.
  In summary, the recurrent chromosomal copy number changes and molecular alterations
  identified in this study may provide an insight into the pathogenesis and development
  of ATC.
