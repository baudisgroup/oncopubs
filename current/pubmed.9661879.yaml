abstract: Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer a predisposition
  to breast as well as ovarian carcinoma. Except for loss of the respective wild-type
  allele, somatic genetic changes needed for the progression of inherited ovarian
  tumors are unknown. A genome-wide search for such alterations was performed by comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-positive n 20 ovarian
  carcinoma specimens. Comparison with sporadic ovarian carcinomas n 20 revealed extensive
  genetic similarity between the inherited and sporadic carcinomas with the sole exception
  of a frequent gain of 2q24-q32 in the inherited group, suggesting the presence of
  an oncogene at 2q24-q32 operating in the absence of BRCA1 function. The overall
  similarity of gains and losses by comparative genomic hybridization suggests a common
  main pathway in tumor progression of both inherited and sporadic ovarian carcinomas.
