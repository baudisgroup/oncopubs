abstract: We analyzed 25 ovarian borderline tumors 13 serous and 12 mucinous tumors
  by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Genomic imbalance was detected in 85
  of serous tumors and 75 of mucinous tumors. Different patterns of genomic alterations
  were identified in serous and mucinous tumors. Gain of the X chromosome was common
  in both serous 30 and mucinous 42 tumors. However, gain of chromosome 8 was detected
  exclusively in 38 of serous and mixed sero-mucinous tumors, but not in any pure
  mucinous tumors. According to the present and previous studies, gain of chromosome
  8 is the most common abnormality in borderline serous tumors. Gain of the same chromosome
  is also common in high grade and advanced stage serous carcinomas, but uncommon
  in early stage serous carcinomas. In addition gain of chromosome X is common in
  borderline serous and mucinous tumors, while loss of chromosome X is predominant
  in invasive carcinomas. These findings do not support the multi-step progression
  theory from borderline tumor to high-grade, advanced stage carcinoma, but indicate
  that the borderline ovarian tumor is a distinct entity. Genes in chromosome 8 may
  be critical for the development and the differentiation of borderline serous tumors.
