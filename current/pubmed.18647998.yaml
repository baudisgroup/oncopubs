abstract: Translocations involving an MYC gene c amp gt N amp gt L are very late tumor
  progression events and provide a paradigm for secondary translocations in multiple
  myeloma. Using a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization and comparative
  genomic hybridization arrays aCGH , we have identified rearrangements of an MYC
  gene in 40 of 43 independent myeloma cell lines. A majority of MYC translocations
  involve an Ig locus IgH amp gt Iglambda amp gt Igkappa , but the breakpoints only
  infrequently occur near or within switch regions or V D J sequences. Surprisingly,
  about 40 of MYC translocations do not involve an Ig locus. The MYC translocations
  mostly are nonreciprocal translocations or insertions, often with the involvement
  of three chromosomes and sometimes with associated duplication, amplification, inversion,
  and other associated chromosomal abnormalities. High-density aCGH analyses should
  facilitate the cloning of MYC breakpoints, enabling the determination of their structures
  and perhaps elucidating how rearrangements not involving an Ig gene cause dysregulation
  of an MYC gene.
