abstract: High grade serous ovarian cancer is characterised by high initial response
  to chemotherapy but poor outcome in the long term due to acquired resistance. One
  of the main genetic features of this disease is TP53 mutation. The majority of TP53
  mutated tumors harbor missense mutations in this gene, correlated with p53 accumulation.
  TP53 null tumors constitute a specific subgroup characterised by nonsense, frameshift
  or splice-site mutations associated to complete absence of p53 expression. Different
  studies show that this kind of tumors may have a worse prognosis than other TP53
  mutated HGSC.  In this study, we sought to characterise the intra-tumor heterogeneity
  of a TP53 null HGSC consisting of six primary tumor samples, two intra-pelvic and
  four extra-pelvic recurrences using exome sequencing and comparative genome hybridisation.  Significant
  heterogeneity was found among the different tumor samples, both at the mutational
  and copy number levels. Exome sequencing identified 102 variants, of which only
  42 were common to all three samples; whereas 7 of the 18 copy number changes found
  by CGH analysis were presented in all samples. Sanger validation of 20 variants
  found by exome sequencing in additional regions of the primary tumor and the recurrence
  allowed us to establish a sequence of the tumor clonal evolution, identifying those
  populations that most likely gave rise to recurrences and genes potentially involved
  in this process, like GPNMB and TFDP1. Using functional annotation and network analysis,
  we identified those biological functions most significantly altered in this tumor.
  Remarkably, unexpected functions such as microtubule-based movement and lipid metabolism
  emerged as important for tumor development and progression, suggesting its potential
  interest as therapeutic targets.  Altogether, our results shed light on the clonal
  evolution of the distinct tumor regions identifying the most aggressive subpopulations
  and at least some of the genes that may be implicated in its progression and recurrence,
  and highlights the importance of considering intra-tumor heterogeneity when carrying
  out genetic and genomic studies, especially when these are aimed to diagnostic procedures
  or to uncover possible therapeutic strategies.
