abstract: Although ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) precedes invasive ductal carcinoma
  (IDC), the related genomic alterations remain unknown. To identify the genomic landscape
  of DCIS and better understand the mechanisms behind progression to IDC, we performed
  whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling for six cases of pure DCIS and
  five pairs of synchronous DCIS and IDC. Pure DCIS harbored well-known mutations
  (e.g., TP53, PIK3CA and AKT1), copy number alterations (CNAs) and chromothripses,
  but had significantly fewer driver genes and co-occurrence of mutation/CNAs than
  synchronous DCIS-IDC. We found neither recurrent nor significantly mutated genes
  with synchronous DCIS-IDC compared to pure DCIS, indicating that there may not be
  a single determinant for pure DCIS progression to IDC. Of note, synchronous DCIS
  genomes were closer to IDC than pure DCIS. Among the clinicopathologic parameters,
  progesterone receptor (PR)-negative status was associated with increased mutations,
  CNAs, co-occurrence of mutations/CNAs and driver mutations. Our results indicate
  that although pure DCIS has already acquired some drivers, more changes are needed
  to progress to IDC. In addition, IDC-associated DCIS is more aggressive than pure
  DCIS at genomic level and should really be considered IDC. Finally, the data suggest
  that PR-negativity could be used to predict aggressive breast cancer genotypes.
