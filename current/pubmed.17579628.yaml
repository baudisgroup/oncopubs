abstract: Whereas neuroblastoma NB with MYCN amplification presents a poor prognosis,
  no single marker allows to reliably predict outcome in tumours without MYCN amplification.
  We report here an extensive analysis of 147 NB samples at diagnosis, without MYCN
  amplification, by chromosomal comparative genomic hybridisation CGH , providing
  a comprehensive overview of their genomic imbalances. Comparative genomic hybridisation
  profiles showed gains or losses of entire chromosomes type 1 in 71 cases, whereas
  partial chromosome gains or losses type 2 , including gain involving 17q were observed
  in 68 cases. Atypical profiles were present in eight cases. A type 1 profile was
  observed more frequently in localised disease P amp lt 0.0001 , and in patients
  of less than 12 months at diagnosis P amp lt 0.0001 . A type 2 genomic profile was
  associated with a higher risk of relapse in the overall population log-rank test
  P amp lt 0.0001 , but also in the subgroup of patients with localised disease log-rank
  test, P 0.007 . In multivariate analysis, the genomic profile was the strongest
  independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, the genomic profile is of prognostic
  impact in patients without MYCN amplification, making it a help in the management
  of low-stage NB. Further studies using higher-resolution CGH are needed to better
  characterise atypical genomic alterations.
