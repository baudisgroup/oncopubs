abstract: Multiple myeloma MM is a neoplasm of malignant plasma cells that often harbors
  many chromosomal aberrations. Currently, fresh frozen tissues FT are considered
  the most reliable for molecular genetic analysis however, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
  FFPE tissues are easily retrievable. Compared with conventional cytogenetics, bacterial
  artificial chromosome BAC array-comparative genomic hybridization CGH allows more
  sensitive detection of chromosomal abnormalities.
