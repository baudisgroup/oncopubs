abstract: The results of cytogenetic investigations on unbalanced chromosome anomalies,
  both constitutional and acquired, were largely improved by comparative genomic hybridization
  on microarray a-CGH , but in mosaicism the ability of a-CGH to reliably detect imbalances
  is not yet well established. This problem of sensitivity is even more relevant in
  acquired mosaicism in neoplastic diseases, where cells carrying acquired imbalances
  coexist with normal cells, in particular when the proportion of abnormal cells may
  be low.We constructed a synthetic mosaicism by mixing the DNA of three patients
  carrying altogether seven chromosome imbalances with normal sex-matched DNA. Dilutions
  were prepared mimicking 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 and 15 levels of mosaicism. Oligomer-based
  a-CGH 244 K whole-genome system was applied on the patients DNA and customized slides
  designed around the regions of imbalance were used for the synthetic mosaics.
