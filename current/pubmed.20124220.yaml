abstract: To further unravel the molecular pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia T-ALL , we performed high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
  on diagnostic specimens from 47 children with T-ALL and identified monoallelic or
  biallelic LEF1 microdeletions in 11 5 of 47 of these primary samples. An additional
  7 3 of 44 of the cases harbored nonsynonymous sequence alterations of LEF1, 2 of
  which produced premature stop codons. Gene expression microarrays showed increased
  expression of MYC and MYC targets in cases with LEF1 inactivation, as well as differentiation
  arrest at an early cortical stage of thymocyte development characterized by expression
  of CD1B, CD1E, and CD8, with absent CD34 expression. LEF1 inactivation was associated
  with a younger age at the time of T-ALL diagnosis, as well as activating NOTCH1
  mutations, biallelic INK4a ARF deletions, and PTEN loss-of-function mutations or
  activating mutations of PI3K or AKT genes. These cases generally lacked overexpression
  of the TAL1, HOX11, HOX11L2, or the HOXA cluster genes, which have been used to
  define separate molecular pathways leading to T-ALL. Our findings suggest that LEF1
  inactivation is an important step in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL in a subset
  of young children.
