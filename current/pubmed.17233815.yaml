abstract: We analyzed the subchromosomal numerical aberrations of 44 surgically resected
  pancreatic adenocarcinomas by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. The
  aberration profile ranged widely between cases, suggesting the presence of multiple
  or complementary mechanisms of evolution in pancreatic cancer, and was associated
  with lymph node metastasis and venous or serosal invasion. A large number of small
  loci, previously uncharacterized in pancreatic cancer, showed non-random loss or
  gain. Frequent losses at 1p36, 4p16, 7q36, 9q34, 11p15, 11q13, 14q32-33, 16p13,
  17p11-13, 17q11-25, 18q21-tel, 19p13, 21q22 and 22q11-12, and gains at 1q25, 2p16,
  2q21-37, 3q25, 5p14, 5q11-13, 7q21, 7p22, 8p22, 8q21-23, 10q21, 12p13, 13q22, 15q13-22
  and 18q11 were identified. Sixteen loci were amplified recurrently. We identified
  novel chromosomal alterations that were significantly associated with a range of
  malignant phenotypes. Gain of LUNX, HCK, E2F1 and DNMT3b at 20q11, loss of p73 at
  1p36 and gain of PPM1D at 17q23 independently predicted patient outcome. Expression
  profiling of amplified genes identified Smurf1 and TRRAP at 7q22.1, BCAS1 at 20q13.2-3,
  and VCL at 10q22.1 as potential novel oncogenes. Our results contribute to a complete
  description of genomic structural aberrations and the identification of potential
  therapeutic targets and genetic indicators that predict patient outcome in pancreatic
  adenocarcinoma.
