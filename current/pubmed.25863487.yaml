abstract: Somatic gene copy number variation contributes to tumor progression. Using
  comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, the presence of genomic imbalances
  was evaluated in a series of 27 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). To detect only
  somatic imbalances, for each sample, the reference DNA was from normal thyroid tissue
  of the same patient. The presence of the BRAF V600E mutation was also evaluated.
  Both amplifications and deletions showed an uneven distribution along the entire
  PTC cohort; amplifications were more frequent than deletions (mean values of 17.5
  and 7.2, respectively). Number of aberration events was not even among samples,
  the majority of them occurring only in a small fraction of PTCs. Most frequent amplifications
  were detected at regions 2q35, 4q26, and 4q34.1, containing FN1, PDE5A, and GALNTL6
  genes, respectively. Most frequent deletions occurred at regions 6q25.2, containing
  OPMR1 and IPCEF1 genes and 7q14.2, containing AOAH and ELMO1 genes. Amplification
  of FN1 and PDE5A genomic regions was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Frequency of
  amplifications and deletions was in relationship with clinical features and BRAF
  mutation status of tumor. In fact, according to the American Joint Committee on
  Cancer stage and American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification, amplifications
  are more frequent in higher risk samples, while deletions tend to prevail in the
  lower risk tumors. Analysis of single aberrations according to the ATA risk grouping
  shows that amplifications containing PDE5A, GALNTL6, DHRS3, and DOCK9 genes are
  significantly more frequent in the intermediate/high risk group than in the low
  risk group. Thus, our data would indicate that analysis of somatic genome aberrations
  by CGH array can be useful to identify additional prognostic variables.
