abstract: Recent studies suggest that thousands of genes may contribute to breast
  cancer pathophysiologies when deregulated by genomic or epigenomic events. Here,
  we describe a model amp quot system amp quot to appraise the functional contributions
  of these genes to breast cancer subsets. In general, the recurrent genomic and transcriptional
  characteristics of 51 breast cancer cell lines mirror those of 145 primary breast
  tumors, although some significant differences are documented. The cell lines that
  comprise the system also exhibit the substantial genomic, transcriptional, and biological
  heterogeneity found in primary tumors. We show, using Trastuzumab Herceptin monotherapy
  as an example, that the system can be used to identify molecular features that predict
  or indicate response to targeted therapies or other physiological perturbations.
