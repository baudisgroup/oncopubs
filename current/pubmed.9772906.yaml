abstract: Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated
  parathyroid hormone levels. It can be caused by overactivity of one adenoma or carcinoma
  or more hyperplasia or multiple adenoma parathyroid glands. Parathyroid adenoma
  and hyperplasia are usually mono- or oligoclonal neoplasms. To establish whether
  parathyroid cancer has a genetic composition distinct from parathyroid adenoma,
  we analyzed 10 adenoma and 10 carcinoma cases by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Results show clear differences between the constitution of adenoma and carcinoma
  genomic DNA. The most frequent genomic alterations in adenoma included deletions
  on chromosomes 11, 17 5 of 10 cases , and 22 7 of 10 cases . In parathyroid carcinoma,
  frequent chromosomal deletions were on chromosome arm 1p 4 of 10 cases and chromosome
  17 3 of 10 cases , and gains were on chromosome 5 3 of 10 cases . Our data indicate
  that different genetic changes could contribute to the development of parathyroid
  adenoma and carcinoma genomic losses predominate in adenoma, and gains along with
  some losses are found in carcinoma. Furthermore, the CGH results implicate several
  chromosomal regions that may harbor genes that could be potentially involved in
  the development of parathyroid adenoma and carcinoma.
