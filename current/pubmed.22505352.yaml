abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC of the head and neck is a malignant tumor with
  poor long-term prognosis. Besides the recently identified MYB-NFIB fusion oncogene
  generated by a t 6 9 translocation, little is known about other genetic alterations
  in ACC. Using high-resolution, array-based comparative genomic hybridization, and
  massively paired-end sequencing, we explored genomic alterations in 40 frozen ACCs.
  Eighty-six percent of the tumors expressed MYB-NFIB fusion transcripts and 97 overexpressed
  MYB mRNA, indicating that MYB activation is a hallmark of ACC. Thirty-five recurrent
  copy number alterations CNAs were detected, including losses involving 12q, 6q,
  9p, 11q, 14q, 1p, and 5q and gains involving 1q, 9p, and 22q. Grade III tumors had
  on average a significantly higher number of CNAs tumor compared to Grade I and II
  tumors P 0.007 . Losses of 1p, 6q, and 15q were associated with high-grade tumors,
  whereas losses of 14q were exclusively seen in Grade I tumors. The t 6 9 rearrangements
  were associated with a complex pattern of breakpoints, deletions, insertions, inversions,
  and for 9p also gains. Analyses of fusion-negative ACCs using high-resolution arrays
  and massively paired-end sequencing revealed that MYB may also be deregulated by
  other mechanisms in addition to gene fusion. Our studies also identified several
  down-regulated candidate tumor suppressor genes CTNNBIP1, CASP9, PRDM2, and SFN
  in 1p36.33-p35.3 that may be of clinical significance in high-grade tumors. Further,
  studies of these and other potential target genes may lead to the identification
  of novel driver genes in ACC.
