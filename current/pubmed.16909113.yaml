abstract: The molecular pathogenesis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma PXA , a rare
  astrocytic brain tumor with a relatively favorable prognosis, is still poorly understood.
  We characterized 50 PXAs by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and found the
  most common imbalance to be loss on chromosome 9 in 50 of tumors. Other recurrent
  losses affected chromosomes 17 10 , 8, 18, 22 4 each . Recurrent gains were identified
  on chromosomes X 16 , 7, 9q, 20 8 each , 4, 5, 19 4 each . Two tumors demonstrated
  amplifications mapping to 2p23-p25, 4p15, 12q13, 12q21, 21q21 and 21q22. Analysis
  of 10 PXAs with available high molecular weight DNA by high-resolution array-based
  CGH indicated homozygous 9p21.3 deletions involving the CDKN2A p14 ARF CDKN2B loci
  in six tumors 60 . Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization to tissue sections
  confirmed the presence of tumor cells with homozygous 9p21.3 deletions. Mutational
  analysis of candidate genes on 9q, PTCH and TSC1, revealed no mutations in PXAs
  with 9q loss and no evidence of TSC1 promoter methylation. However, PXAs consistently
  showed low TSC1 transcript levels. Taken together, our study identifies loss of
  chromosome 9 as the most common chromosomal imbalance in PXAs and suggests important
  roles for homozygous CDKN2A p14 ARF CDKN2B deletion as well as low TSC1 mRNA expression
  in these tumors.
