abstract: Genetic events mediating transformation from premalignant monoclonal gammopathies
  MG to multiple myeloma MM are unknown. To obtain a comprehensive genomic profile
  of MG from the early to late stages, we performed high-resolution analysis of purified
  plasma cells from 20 MGUS, 20 smoldering MM SMM and 34 MM by high-density 6.0 SNP
  array. A progressive increase in the incidence of copy number abnormalities CNA
  from MGUS to SMM and to MM median 5, 7.5 and 12 per case, respectively was observed
  P 0.006 . Gains on 1q, 3p, 6p, 9p, 11q, 19p, 19q and 21q along with 1p, 16q and
  22q deletions were significantly less frequent in MGUS than in MM. Although 11q
  and 21q gains together with 16q and 22q deletions were apparently exclusive of MM
  status, we observed that these abnormalities were also present in minor subclones
  in MGUS. Overall, a total of 65 copy number-neutral LOH CNN-LOH were detected. Their
  frequency was higher in active MM than in the asymptomatic entities P 0.047 . A
  strong association between genetic lesions and fragile sites was also detected.
  In summary, our study shows an increasing genomic complexity from MGUS to MM and
  identifies new chromosomal regions involved in CNA and CNN-LOH.
