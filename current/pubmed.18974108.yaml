abstract: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, and pilocytic
  astrocytomas PA are the most common central nervous system tumor in 5 to 19 year
  olds. Little is known about the genetic alterations underlying their development.
  Here, we describe a tandem duplication of approximately 2 Mb at 7q34 occurring in
  66 of PAs. This rearrangement, which was not observed in a series of 244 higher-grade
  astrocytomas, results in an in-frame fusion gene incorporating the kinase domain
  of the BRAF oncogene. We further show that the resulting fusion protein has constitutive
  BRAF kinase activity and is able to transform NIH3T3 cells. This is the first report
  of BRAF activation through rearrangement as a frequent feature in a sporadic tumor.
  The frequency and specificity of this change underline its potential both as a therapeutic
  target and as a diagnostic tool.
