abstract: Hyperdiploidy sometimes is found in mycosis fungoides-S zary syndrome, but
  its diagnostic significance remains undefined. We report an unusual case of S zary
  syndrome manifesting with leukemic large cell transformation. Conventional karyotypic
  analysis showed the presence of a near-tetraploid neoplastic clone. With dual-color
  cytometric analysis, we showed that the large S zary cells were near-tetraploid
  with a DNA index of 1.86, thereby demonstrating a direct relationship between cell
  size and ploidy. Comparative genomic hybridization further showed chromosomal imbalances
  that were not revealed on conventional karyotyping. Our findings suggest that hyperdiploidy
  may be a marker of large cell transformation, so that when this karyotypic abnormality
  is found in mycosis fungoides-S zary syndrome, a search for such a complication
  is indicated.
