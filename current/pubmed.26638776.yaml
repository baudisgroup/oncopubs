abstract: Patients with chromosome 13q deletion or normal cytogenetics represent the
  majority of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cases, yet have relatively few driver
  mutations. To better understand their genomic landscape, here we perform whole-genome
  sequencing on a cohort of patients enriched with these cytogenetic characteristics.
  Mutations in known CLL drivers are seen in only 33% of this cohort, and associated
  with normal cytogenetics and unmutated IGHV. The most commonly mutated gene in our
  cohort, IGLL5, shows a mutational pattern suggestive of activation-induced cytidine
  deaminase (AID) activity. Unsupervised analysis of mutational signatures demonstrates
  the activities of canonical AID (c-AID), leading to clustered mutations near active
  transcriptional start sites; non-canonical AID (nc-AID), leading to genome-wide
  non-clustered mutations, and an ageing signature responsible for most mutations.
  Using mutation clonality to infer time of onset, we find that while ageing and c-AID
  activities are ongoing, nc-AID-associated mutations likely occur earlier in tumour
  evolution.
