abstract: Synchronous primary breast cancer describes the occurrence of multiple tumors
  affecting one or both breasts at initial diagnosis. This provides a unique opportunity
  to identify tissue-specific genomic markers that characterize each tumor while controlling
  for the individual genetic background of a patient. The aim of this study was to
  examine the genomic alterations and degree of similarity between synchronous cancers.
  Using metaphase comparative genomic hybridization and array comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH , the genomic alterations of 23 synchronous breast cancers from
  10 patients were examined at both chromosomal and gene levels. Synchronous breast
  cancers, when compared to their matched counterparts, were found to have a common
  core set of genetic alterations, with additional unique changes present in each.
  They also frequently exhibited features distinct from the more usual solitary primary
  breast cancers. The most frequent genomic alterations included chromosomal gains
  of 1q, 3p, 4q, and 8q, and losses of 11q, 12q, 16q, and 17p. aCGH identified copy
  number amplification in regions that are present in all 23 tumor samples, including
  1p31.3-1p32.3 harboring JAK1. Our findings suggest that synchronous primary breast
  cancers represent a unique type of breast cancer and, at least in some instances,
  one tumor may give rise to the other.
