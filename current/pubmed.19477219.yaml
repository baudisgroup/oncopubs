abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma MCL is a lymphoma characterized by aberrant activation
  of CCND1 cyclin D1 followed by sequential genetic abnormalities. Genomic abnormalities
  in MCL have been extensively examined by classical cytogenetics and microarray-based
  comparative genomic hybridization techniques, pointing out a number of alterations
  in genomic regions that correlate with the neoplastic phenotype and survival. Recently,
  single nucleotide polymorphism genomic microarrays SNP-chip have been developed
  and used for analysis of cancer genomics. This technique allows detection of genomic
  changes with higher resolution, including loss of heterozygosity without changes
  of gene dosage, so-called acquired uniparental disomy aUPD .
