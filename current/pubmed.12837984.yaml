abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma SCC is the most frequent malignant tumor of the
  upper aerodigestive tract. Cell lines of these tumors facilitate the investigation
  of various tumor biological parameters. This study was conducted to compare molecular
  biologic characteristics between cell lines and fresh tumor tissue.
