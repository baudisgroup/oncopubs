abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify key genetic pathways involved
  in non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC and understand their role in tumor progression.
  We performed a genome wide scanning using paired tumors and corresponding 16 mucosal
  biopsies from four follow-up lung cancer patients on Affymetrix 250K-NSpI array
  platform. We found that a single gene SH3GL2 located on human chromosome 9p22 was
  most frequently deleted in all the tumors and corresponding mucosal biopsies. We
  further validated the alteration pattern of SH3GL2 in a substantial number of primary
  NSCLC tumors at DNA and protein level. We also overexpressed wild-type SH3GL2 in
  three NSCLC cell lines to understand its role in NSCLC progression. Validation in
  116 primary NSCLC tumors confirmed frequent loss of heterozygosity of SH3GL2 in
  overall 51 49 97 of the informative cases. We found significantly low p 0.0015 SH3GL2
  protein expression in 71 43 60 primary tumors. Forced overexpression of wild-type
  wt SH3GL2 in three NSCLC cell lines resulted in a marked reduction of active epidermal
  growth factor receptor EGFR expression and an increase in EGFR internalization and
  degradation. Significantly decreased in vitro p 0.0015-0.030 and in vivo p 0.016
  cellular growth, invasion p 0.029-0.049 , and colony formation p 0.023-0.039 were
  also evident in the wt-SH3GL2-transfected cells accompanied by markedly low expression
  of activated AKT Ser 473 , STAT3 Tyr 705 , and PI3K. Downregulation of SH3GL2 interactor
  USP9X and activated ss-catenin was also evident in the SH3GL2-transfected cells.
  Our results indicate that SH3GL2 is frequently deleted in NSCLC and regulates cellular
  growth and invasion by modulating EGFR function.
