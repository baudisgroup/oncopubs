abstract: Development and preclinical testing of new cancer therapies is limited by
  the scarcity of in vivo models that authentically reproduce tumor growth and metastatic
  progression. We report new models for breast tumor growth and metastasis in the
  form of transplantable tumors derived directly from individuals undergoing treatment
  for breast cancer. These tumor grafts illustrate the diversity of human breast cancer
  and maintain essential features of the original tumors, including metastasis to
  specific sites. Co-engraftment of primary human mesenchymal stem cells maintains
  phenotypic stability of the grafts and increases tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis.
  We also report that tumor engraftment is a prognostic indicator of disease outcome
  for women with newly diagnosed breast cancer orthotopic breast tumor grafting is
  a step toward individualized models for tumor growth, metastasis and prognosis.
  This bank of tumor grafts also serves as a publicly available resource for new models
  in which to study the biology of breast cancer.
