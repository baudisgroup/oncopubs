abstract: The impact of the genomic imbalances on the clinical outcome of 34 patients
  with lymph-node positive high-risk breast cancer HRBC was investigated using comparative
  genomic hybridization. All of the patients were uniformly treated with high-dose
  chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. The average number of chromosomal
  imbalances per tumor was 11 range, 2-24 , including DNA overrepresentation on chromosomes
  1q 59 , 17q 38 , 8q and 16p 35 each , 20q 32 , and 19p 26 , and genomic losses involving
  9p and 18q 41 , 8p, 11q, and 18p 38 , 17p 32 , 4p and Xq 29 , and 16q 26 . The most
  significant association among genomic changes and clinical-pathological features
  was the correlation of the loss of 8p with progesterone receptor positivity P amp
  lt 0.005 . With a median follow-up time of 74 months, 15 patients 44 have relapsed.
  In the univariate analysis, patients with gain amplification of 17q including the
  HER-2 neu gene locus had a longer disease-free survival P 0.02 , whereas those with
  genomic loss of 18p had a higher probability of relapse P 0.003 . In multivariate
  analysis, the loss of 18p was the only parameter correlated with shorter disease-free
  survival relative risk, 4.8 95 confidence interval, 1.57-14.8 P 0.006 . In summary,
  our data indicate that the tumoral genomic profile may represent a valuable marker
  for predicting the clinical outcome in HRBC. Furthermore, the genomic loss of 18p
  may identify a poor prognostic subgroup of patients with HRBC.
