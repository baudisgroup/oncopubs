abstract: BACKGROUND:Olfactory neuroblastoma ONB is a rare cancer of the sinonasal
  tract with little molecular characterization. We performed whole genome sequencing
  WGS on paired normal and tumor DNA from a patient with metastatic-ONB to identify
  the somatic alterations that might be drivers of tumorigenesis and or metastatic
  progression.METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh frozen
  tissue from a metastatic lesion and whole blood, followed by WGS at gt 30X depth,
  alignment and mapping, and mutation analyses. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm
  selected mutations. Sixty-two somatic short nucleotide variants SNVs and five deletions
  were identified inside coding regions, each causing a non-synonymous DNA sequence
  change. We selected seven SNVs and validated them by Sanger sequencing. In the metastatic
  ONB samples collected several months prior to WGS, all seven mutations were present.
  However, in the original surgical resection specimen prior to evidence of metastatic
  disease , mutations in KDR, MYC, SIN3B, and NLRC4 genes were not present, suggesting
  that these were acquired with disease progression and or as a result of post-treatment
  effects.CONCLUSIONS SIGNIFICANCE:This work provides insight into the evolution of
  ONB cancer cells and provides a window into the more complex factors, including
  tumor clonality and multiple driver mutations.
