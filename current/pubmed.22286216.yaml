abstract: To identify somatic mutations in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
  (DIPG), we performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from seven DIPGs and matched
  germline tissue and targeted sequencing of an additional 43 DIPGs and 36 non-brainstem
  pediatric glioblastomas (non-BS-PGs). We found that 78% of DIPGs and 22% of non-BS-PGs
  contained a mutation in H3F3A, encoding histone H3.3, or in the related HIST1H3B,
  encoding histone H3.1, that caused a p.Lys27Met amino acid substitution in each
  protein. An additional 14% of non-BS-PGs had somatic mutations in H3F3A causing
  a p.Gly34Arg alteration.
