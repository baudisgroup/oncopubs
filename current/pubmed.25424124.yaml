abstract: Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) account for 1-2% of all tumors in young
  and middle aged men. A 75-fold increase in TCGT development has been reported for
  monozygotic (MZ) twins. Therefore, the occurrence of simultaneous tumors in MZ twins
  emphasizes the importance of genetic factors that influence the risk of developing
  these tumors. Genomic screening was performed for one family containing MZ twins
  with testicular germ cell tumors, in order to define alterations associated with
  risk of tumor development.  Copy number alterations were evaluated using array-CGH
  (4x44K, Agilent Technologies) in one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma (EC) from
  MZ twins. In addition, genomic alterations from the tumors and peripheral blood
  cells of the twins were compared to the parental genomes via their peripheral blood
  cells.  Embryonal carcinoma (Twin-1ï¿½t) presented a lower frequency of genomic
  alterations compared to the seminoma (Twin-2ï¿½t). One minimal common region of
  loss was observed in 9p13.1-p12 in the comparison between DNA from blood samples
  for Twin-1 and Twin-2. In this region is mapped the CNTNAP3 gene which was confirmed
  as involved in losses by qPCR. Comparative analysis of novel CNVs between the Twin-1ï¿½t
  and Twin-2ï¿½t showed five minimal common regions involving gain at chromosomes
  12 (12p12.3-p11.1 and 12p13.33-p12.3), while losses were observed at 10p15.3-p15.2,
  13q21.1-q21.2 and 15q11.1-q11.2. In addition, one exclusive rare copy number alteration
  was detected in Twin-1ï¿½t and Twin-2ï¿½t, and 19 novel alterations were identified
  in the Twin-2ï¿½t.  Distinct genomic profiles for MZ twins with phenotypically different
  TGCT were described. Of particular interest, 12p gains were detected exclusively
  in tumor samples. In peripheral blood samples, loss of 9p13.1-p12 was the unique
  novel CNV shared by the twins, confirming the involvement of CNTNAP3 gene in TGCTs
  development. Although similar CNV profiles were shared by both the peripheral blood
  and tumor samples of the twins, tumor-specific CNV loci were identified for seminoma
  and non-seminomatous tumors. These findings suggest the presence of de novo germline
  structural alterations and TGCT predisposition.
