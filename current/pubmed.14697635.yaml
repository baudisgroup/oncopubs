abstract: Primary carcinomas of the vagina are rare tumors, accounting for 2 -3 of
  all gynecologic malignancies. Only a few karyotypes based on chromosome banding
  techniques have been reported. We have, therefore, used comparative genomic hybridization
  to establish a pattern of genomic imbalances in vaginal squamous cell carcinomas.
  Analysis of 16 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumors revealed that 70 of vaginal
  carcinomas carry relative copy number increases that map to chromosome arm 3q. Other
  recurring gains were observed on chromosome arms 5p and 19p. Chromosomal losses
  were infrequent. Most tumors were aneuploid, as measured by image cytometry on Feulgen-stained
  tissue sections. The cytogenetic data were related to the presence of human papillomavirus
  genomes, expression of laminin-5 as a marker for invasiveness, and expression levels
  of markers for proliferative activity and mutated TP53. All relevant clinical data
  were recorded. The results suggest that vaginal carcinomas are defined by a specific
  distribution of chromosomal aneuploidies and that the pattern of genomic imbalances
  is strikingly similar to that observed in squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine
  cervix. Age at diagnosis P 0.031 , tumor size P 0.025 , and increased laminin-5
  expression P 0.006 have a significant influence on the survival time.
