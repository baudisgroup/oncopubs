abstract: Conventional cytogenetic and comparative genomic hybridization CGH studies
  have shown that osteosarcomas OSs are characterized by complex structural and numerical
  chromosomal alterations and gene amplification. In this study, we used high-resolution
  CGH to investigate recurrent patterns of genomic imbalance by use of DNA derived
  from nine OS tumors hybridized to a 19,200-clone cDNA microarray. In six OSs, there
  was copy number gain or amplification of 6p, with a minimal region of gain centering
  on segment 6p12.1. In seven OSs, the pattern of amplification affecting chromosome
  arm 8q showed high-level gains of 8q12-21.3 and 8q22-q23, with amplification of
  the MYC oncogene at 8q24.2. Seven OSs showed copy number gain or amplification of
  17p between the loci bounded by GAS7 and PMI 17p11.2-17p12 , and three of these
  tumors also showed small losses at 17p13, including the region containing TP53.
  An in silico analysis of the distribution of segmental duplications duplicons in
  this region identified a large number of tracts consisting of paralogous sequences
  mapping to the 17p region, encompassing the region of deletions and amplifications
  in OS. Interestingly, within this same region there were clusters of duplicons and
  several genes that are expressed during bone morphogenesis and in OS. In summary,
  microarray CGH analysis of the chromosomal imbalances of OS confirm the overall
  pattern observed by use of metaphase CGH and provides a more precise refinement
  of the boundaries of genomic gains and losses that characterize this tumor.
