abstract: Our previous comparative genomic hybridization CGH study of Ewing sarcoma
  and related tumors showed that DNA sequence copy number increases of 1q21-q22 and
  of chromosomes 8 and 12 were associated with trends toward poor survival Armengol
  et al., Br J Cancer 1997, 75, 1403-1409 . These trends were not statistically significant.
  In the present study, we analyzed 28 primary Ewing sarcomas and related tumors by
  CGH to study whether these or other changes have prognostic value in these tumors.
  Twenty-one tumors 75 had changes with a mean of 1.9 changes per tumor. The most
  frequent aberration was gain of chromosome 8 in 10 tumors 36 . Five tumors 18 had
  copy number increases at 1q21-22 and 5 had gain of 7q. Copy number increase of 6p21.1-pter,
  gain of chromosome 12, and loss of 16q were seen in 11 . Copy number increases of
  1q21-q22 and of chromosomes 8 and 12 were associated with trends toward worse outcome,
  but the differences did not reach statistical significance. A novel finding is the
  association of copy number increase at 6p with worse distant disease-free P 0.04
  and overall survival P 0.004 . To confirm this finding and to see whether copy number
  increases of 1q21-q22 and of chromosomes 8 and 12 have definite prognostic value,
  a larger number of cases needs to be studied.
