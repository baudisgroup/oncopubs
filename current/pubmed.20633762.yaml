abstract: 'Unlike the case with some other solid tumors, whole genome array screening
  has not revealed prognostic genetic aberrations in primary gastric cancer. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH using bacterial artificial chromosome BAC arrays for 56
  primary gastric cancers resulted in identification of four prognostic loci in this
  study: 6q21 harboring FOXO3A previously FKHRL1 , 9q32 UGCG , 17q21.1 approximately
  q21.2 CASC3 , and 17q21.32 HOXB3 through HOXB9 . If any one of these four loci was
  deleted, the prognosis of the patient was significantly worse P 0.0019 . This was
  true even for advanced tumors stage IIIA, IIB, or IV, n 39 P 0.0113 , whereas only
  1 of the 17 patients with less advanced tumors stage IA, IB, or II n 17 died of
  disease after surgery. Multivariate analysis according to the status of four BACs
  or pathological stage based on the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma
  stages IA, IB, and II vs. stages IIIA, IIIB, and IV demonstrated that the BAC clone
  status was also an independent prognostic factor P 0.006 . These findings may help
  predict which patients with malignant potential need more intensive therapy, or
  may point to new therapeutic approaches especially for advanced tumors. The parameter
  here termed the integrated genomic prognostic biomarker may therefore be of clinical
  utility as a prognostic biomarker.'
