abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL in infants is characterized by a high frequency
  of MLL gene rearrangements. By contrast, the t 12 21 ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene is typically
  detected in children older than 2 years. In a series of Brazilian infant leukemia
  cases, however, four younger cases harbored ETV6-RUNX1, at ages 2, 3, 5, and 7 months.
  This finding could represent a unique model for delineating the additional genomic
  hits required to accelerate the emergence of a frank leukemia in these t 12 21 -positive
  cases. We applied a whole-genome copy number analysis with single-nucleotide polymorphism
  SNP arrays, comparing t 12 21 infants with older pediatric age groups. Recurrent
  deletions, including 9p21.3 CDKN2A, CKDN2B, and MTAP , 11p13 CD44 , 12p13.2 ETV6
  , and patient-specific abnormalities were identified. Although infant cases with
  t 12 21 did not display specific genetic abnormalities explaining the short latency
  to overt leukemia, the frequency of copy number abnormalities increased proportionally
  with age. This novel SNP array analysis in an extremely rare series of cases opens
  new ideas about the etiology of ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL.
