abstract: Ideopathic myelofibrosis IMF is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder resulting
  in bone marrow fibrosis as a consequence of growth factor release from clonal haematopoiesis.
  Conventional cytogenetic analysis identifies abnormalities in approximately a third
  of cases at diagnosis, although rarely uncovers unique, primary genetic events.
  We have used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to study 25 IMF cases and have
  compared the results with conventional cytogenetics. Metaphase cells were available
  for analysis in 13 cases, of which seven showed an abnormal karyotype. CGH chromosomal
  profiles showed imbalances in 21 of 25 cases. The most frequent aberrations were
  gains of 9p 12 cases , 2q seven cases , 3p seven cases , chromosome 4 seven cases
  , 12q seven cases , 13q eight cases . The main losses were at 17q and occurred in
  six cases. The results for CGH and cytogenetics were matched for one case only.
  Investigation of IMF by CGH suggests that genomic aberrations are much more common
  than has been previously indicated by conventional cytogenetic analysis and occur
  in the majority of cases. Gains of 9p were the most frequent finding, occurring
  in 50 of patients and suggests that genes on 9p may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis
  of IMF.
