abstract: We used genome-wide methylation microarrays to analyze differences in CpG
  methylation patterns in cells relevant to the pathogenesis of myeloma plasma cells
  B cells, normal plasma cells, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
  MGUS , presentation myeloma, and plasma cell leukemia . We show that methylation
  patterns in these cell types are capable of distinguishing nonmalignant from malignant
  cells and the main reason for this difference is hypomethylation of the genome at
  the transition from MGUS to presentation myeloma. In addition, gene-specific hypermethylation
  was evident at the myeloma stage. Differential methylation was also evident at the
  transition from myeloma to plasma cell leukemia with remethylation of the genome,
  particularly of genes involved in cell-cell signaling and cell adhesion, which may
  contribute to independence from the bone marrow microenvironment. There was a high
  degree of methylation variability within presentation myeloma samples, which was
  associated with cytogenetic differences between samples. More specifically, we found
  methylation subgroups were defined by translocations and hyperdiploidy, with t 4
  14 myeloma having the greatest impact on DNA methylation. Two groups of hyperdiploid
  samples were identified, on the basis of unsupervised clustering, which had an impact
  on overall survival. Overall, DNA methylation changes significantly during disease
  progression and between cytogenetic subgroups.
