abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme GM is the most common and most malignant astrocytoma
  in adults. After surgery, radiation therapy extends patient survival however, in
  vivo response to radiation therapy is variable. The purpose of this investigation
  was to determine whether the cytogenetic abnormalities of GM differ according to
  patient response to radiation therapy. Radiation response was defined by either
  progression radiation-resistant RR or resolution radiation-sensitive RS of tumor
  at the first postradiation radiographic imaging evaluation. Twenty RR and 10 RS
  frozen tissue specimens were subjected to cytogenetic analysis by comparative genomic
  hybridization. RS and RR specimens had different cytogenetic aberrations that mapped
  predominantly to chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 13, and 19. Relative gain of 7 occurred in
  70 of the RR and 30 of the RS cases and was the most significant difference involving
  a single change between the two groups P 0.06 . RR and RS specimens also differed
  in their patterns of simultaneous cytogenetic aberrations. A simultaneous gain of
  chromosomes 7 and 19 was found in 30 of the RR cases but was absent in the RS group.
  Concurrent loss of 9p23-24 and 13q14 regions was absent in the RS cohort but occurred
  in 30 of the RR series. This latter cytogenetic pattern was also associated with
  older age. Amplifications were more common in the RR series, but the difference
  did not reach statistical significance. The data suggest that GM with different
  in vivo responses to radiation therapy also differ cytogenetically.
