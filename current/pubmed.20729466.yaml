abstract: Genomic aberrations are of predominant importance to the biology and clinical
  outcome of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia AML , and conventional karyotype-based
  risk classifications are routinely used in clinical decision making in AML. One
  of the known limitations of cytogenetic analysis is the inability to detect genomic
  abnormalities less than 5 Mb in size, and it is currently unclear whether overcoming
  this limitation with high-resolution genomic single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP
  array analysis would be clinically relevant. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity
  of molecular mechanisms aberrations that underlie the conventional karyotype-based
  risk classifications, it is likely that further refinements in genomic risk prognostication
  can be achieved. In this study, we analyzed flow cytometer-sorted, AML blast-derived,
  and paired, buccal DNA from 114 previously untreated prospectively enrolled AML
  patients for acquired genomic copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity using
  Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays, and we correlated genomic lesion load and specific chromosomal
  abnormalities with patient survival. Using multivariate analyses, we found that
  having  2 genomic lesions detected through SNP 6.0 array profiling approximately
  doubles the risk of death when controlling for age- and karyotype-based risk. Finally,
  we identified an independent negative prognostic impact of p53 mutations, or p53
  mutations and 17p-loss of heterozygosity combined on survival in AML.
