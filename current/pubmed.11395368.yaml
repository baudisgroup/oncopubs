abstract: Parasympathetic paragangliomas PGLs represent neuroendocrine tumors arising
  from chief cells in branchiomeric and intravagal paraganglia, which share several
  histological features with their sympathetic counterpart sympathoadrenal paragangliomas.
  In recent years, genetic analyses of the familial form of PGL have attracted considerable
  interest. However, the majority of paragangliomas occurs sporadically and it remains
  to be determined whether the pathogenesis of sporadic paraganglioma resembles that
  of the familial form. Furthermore, data on comparative genetic aberrations are scarce.
  To provide fundamental cytogenetic data on sporadic and hereditary PGLs, we performed
  comparative genomic hybridization using directly fluorochrome-conjugated DNA extracted
  from 12 frozen and 4 paraffin-embedded tumors. The comparative genomic hybridization
  data were extended by loss of heterozygosity analysis of chromosome 11q. DNA copy
  number changes were found in 10 63 of 16 tumors. The most frequent chromosomal imbalance
  involved loss of chromosome 11. Six of seven familial tumors and two of nine sporadic
  tumors showed loss of 11q 86 versus 22 , P 0.012 . Deletions of 11p and 5p were
  found in two of nine sporadic tumors. We conclude that overall DNA copy number changes
  are infrequent in PGLs compared to sympathetic paragangliomas and that loss of chromosome
  11 may be an important event in their tumorigenesis, particularly in familial paragangliomas.
