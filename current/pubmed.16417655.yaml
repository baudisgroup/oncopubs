abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide and
  consequently has been extensively investigated in terms of histopathology, immunochemistry
  and familial history. Advances in genome-wide approaches have contributed to molecular
  classification with respect to genomic changes and their subsequent effects on gene
  expression. Cell lines have provided a renewable resource that is readily used as
  model systems for breast cancer cell biology. A thorough characterization of their
  genomes to identify regions of segmental DNA loss potential tumor-suppressor-containing
  loci and gain potential oncogenic loci would greatly facilitate the interpretation
  of biological data derived from such cells. In this study we characterized the genomes
  of seven of the most commonly used breast cancer model cell lines at unprecedented
  resolution using a newly developed whole-genome tiling path genomic DNA array.
