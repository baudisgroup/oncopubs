abstract: We have screened 22 bladder tumour-derived cell lines and one normal urothelium-derived
  cell line for genome-wide copy number changes using array comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Comparison of array CGH with existing multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization
  M-FISH results revealed excellent concordance. Regions of gain and loss were defined
  more accurately by array CGH, and several small regions of deletion were detected
  that were not identified by M-FISH. Numerous genetic changes were identified, many
  of which were compatible with previous results from conventional CGH and loss of
  heterozygosity analyses on bladder tumours. The most frequent changes involved complete
  or partial loss of 4q 83 and gain of 20q 78 . Other frequent losses were of 18q
  65 , 8p 65 , 2q 61 , 6q 61 , 3p 56 , 13q 56 , 4p 52 , 6p 52 , 10p 52 , 10q 52 and
  5p 43 . We have refined the localization of a region of deletion at 8p21.2-p21.3
  to an interval of approximately 1 Mb. Five homozygous deletions of tumour suppressor
  genes were confirmed, and several potentially novel homozygous deletions were identified.
  In all, 15 high-level amplifications were detected, with a previously reported amplification
  at 6p22.3 being the most frequent. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a novel candidate
  gene with consistent overexpression in all cell lines with the 6p22.3 amplicon.
