abstract: Liver metastases are the major cause of cancer-related death in colorectal
  cancer patients with a tendency to recur in over 50 of the cases even after curatively
  intended surgery. Prognosis after liver resection, however, can neither be based
  on macroscopic or light microscopic evaluation of the metastases nor on clinical
  data alone. This is a pilot study in order to determine a potential influence of
  chromosomal aberrations on overall survival and relapse rate after curative liver
  resection.
