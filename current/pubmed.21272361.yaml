abstract: Molecular alterations critical to development of cancer include mutations,
  copy number alterations amplifications and deletions as well as genomic rearrangements
  resulting in gene fusions. Massively parallel next generation sequencing, which
  enables the discovery of such changes, uses considerable quantities of genomic DNA
  amp gt 5 ug , a serious limitation in ever smaller clinical samples. However, a
  commonly available microarray platforms such as array comparative genomic hybridization
  array CGH allows the characterization of gene copy number at a single gene resolution
  using much smaller amounts of genomic DNA. In this study we evaluate the sensitivity
  of ultra-dense array CGH platforms developed by Agilent, especially that of the
  1 million probe array 1 M array , and their application when whole genome amplification
  is required because of limited sample quantities.
