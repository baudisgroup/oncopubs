abstract: Acute myeloid leukaemia is a highly malignant haematopoietic tumour that
  affects about 13,000 adults in the United States each year. The treatment of this
  disease has changed little in the past two decades, because most of the genetic
  events that initiate the disease remain undiscovered. Whole-genome sequencing is
  now possible at a reasonable cost and timeframe to use this approach for the unbiased
  discovery of tumour-specific somatic mutations that alter the protein-coding genes.
  Here we present the results obtained from sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukaemia
  genome, and its matched normal counterpart obtained from the same patient's skin.
  We discovered ten genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations
  that are thought to contribute to tumour progression, and eight were new mutations
  present in virtually all tumour cells at presentation and relapse, the function
  of which is not yet known. Our study establishes whole-genome sequencing as an unbiased
  method for discovering cancer-initiating mutations in previously unidentified genes
  that may respond to targeted therapies.
