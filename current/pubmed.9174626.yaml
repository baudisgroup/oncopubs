abstract: Hyperplasia without and with atypia is considered to be a precursor lesion
  for certain breast carcinomas. The cytogenetic events and the molecular pathology
  involved in the multistep process from normal to invasive carcinoma are unknown.
  To characterise the sequence of early genetic abnormalities of chromosome 17q and
  their biological consequences in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed
  immunohistochemistry on 451 breast tissues including 180 normal breast specimens,
  28 hyperplastic lesions without atypia and 44 with atypia, 100 cases of ductal carcinoma
  in situ DCIS and 99 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. We correlated the overexpression
  of the c-ErbB-2 protein, the histological and the recently proposed differentiation
  classification of DCIS with the extent of DCIS. For fluorescence in situ hybridisation
  FISH analysis, different probes spanning the 17q region including the c-erbB-2 gene
  locus and those which are found adjacent, were used. Reverse painting and comparative
  genomic hybridisation CGH were performed on several breast cancer cell lines. c-ErbB-2
  overexpression was observed in only 29 of DCIS and 23 of invasive carcinomas, but
  not in hyperplastic and normal tissue. c-ErbB-2 overexpression is correlated with
  poor differentiation in DCIS but not in invasive carcinoma. In DCIS, there was no
  correlation with the histological subtype classification. The average extent of
  DCIS is significantly increased from 13.81 mm in c-ErbB-2 negative cases to 29.37
  mm in c-ErbB-2 positive cases. The increase was considered to be a possible consequence
  of the overexpression and is probably due to the previously described motility enhancing
  effect of the c-ErbB-2 protein. The histological and differentiation classification
  of DCIS did not correlate with the extent of disease. Using FISH, amplified genes
  at 17q12, always including the c-erbB-2 gene, were detected in all cases of DCIS
  and invasive carcinoma with c-ErbB-2 overexpression. The centromeric region and
  the NF1 locus, which is located between the centromere and c-erbB-2, were not amplified
  in any of the DCIS and invasive breast carcinomas, but co-amplification of the myeloperoxidase
  gene was detected in 3 5 DCIS and 1 5 invasive carcinomas with c-ErbB-2 overexpression.
  In contrast to c-erbB-2, immunohistochemical overexpression of their respective
  gene products was not observed. FISH, reverse painting and CGH show similar amplified
  genes with amplified c-erbB-2 in c-ErbB-2 overexpressing SK-BR-3 and BT474 human
  breast cancer cells. The amplified genes are part of two different amplicons. Extensive
  modifications of the 17q chromosomal region, caused by translocation, were also
  observed in these cell lines. It is concluded that the modifications of chromosome
  17q, inducing overexpression of c-ErbB-2 protein, occur at the level of transition
  from hyperplasia to DCIS. They are preserved in invasive carcinoma with overexpression
  of c-ErbB-2 protein. This had led to the hypothesis that these modifications at
  17q may lead to a larger extent of DCIS.
