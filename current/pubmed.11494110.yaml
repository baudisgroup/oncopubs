abstract: In order to find common genetic abnormalities that may identify loci of
  genes involved in the development of adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC , we investigated
  DNA copy number changes in 24 of these tumors by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . Our results indicate that unlike many carcinomas, ACCs have relatively few
  changes in DNA copy number overall. Twenty tumors had DNA copy number changes, which
  were mostly restricted to a few chromosomal arms. A frequent novel finding was the
  loss of DNA copy number in chromosome 12q eight tumors, 33 with the minimal common
  overlapping region at 12q12--q13. Deletion in this region has not been reported
  to be frequent in other types of cancer analyzed by CGH. In addition, deletions
  in 6q23-qter and 13q21--q22 and gains of chromosome 19 were observed in 25 to 38
  of ACCs. Deletion of 19q, previously reported in a small series of ACC, was not
  identified in the current group of carcinomas. The current CGH results for chromosomes
  12 and 19 were confirmed by microsatellite allelotyping. These results indicate
  that DNA copy number losses in 12q may be important in the oncogenesis of ACC and
  suggest that the 12q12--q13 region may harbor a new tumor-suppressor gene.
