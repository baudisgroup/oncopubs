abstract: Leiomyosarcomas are rare in the head and neck region. The treatment of choice
  is surgical resection. We present a case of leiomyosarcoma in a 50-year-old female
  patient, arising from the inferior turbinate. The tumor was resected by a transnasal
  microendoscopic approach and no evidence for tumor recurrence was found during an
  endoscopic and radiologic follow-up of two years. Cytogenetic analysis by means
  of comparative genomic hybridization revealed chromosomal gains at 4p13p15, 6p21p22,
  7q22qter, 9q22qter and chromosomal losses at 10q22qter and 19p12p13.1. With augmented
  experience, the transnasal approach may be appropriate to resect circumscribed malignant
  tumors located in the nasal cavity.
