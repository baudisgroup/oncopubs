abstract: Waldenstr ms macroglobulinemia WM is a distinct clinicobiological entity
  defined as a B-cell neoplasm characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in
  bone marrow BM and IgM paraprotein production. Cytogenetic analyses were historically
  limited by difficulty in obtaining tumor metaphases, and the genetic basis of the
  disease remains poorly defined. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis in 42
  WM patients by using a high-resolution, array-based comparative genomic hybridization
  approach to unravel the genetic mechanisms associated with WM pathogenesis. Overall,
  83 of cases have chromosomal abnormalities, with a median of three abnormalities
  per patient. Gain of 6p was the second most common abnormality 17 , and its presence
  was always concomitant with 6q loss. A minimal deleted region, including MIRN15A
  and MIRN16-1, was delineated on 13q14 in 10 of patients. Of interest, we reported
  biallelic deletions and or inactivating mutations with uniparental disomy in tumor
  necrosis factor TNF receptor-associated factor 3 and TNFalpha-induced protein 3,
  two negative regulators of the nuclear factor-kappaB NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
  Furthermore, we confirmed the association between TRAF3 inactivation and increased
  transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB target genes. Mutational activation of the
  NF-kappaB pathway, which is normally activated by ligand receptor interactions within
  the BM microenvironment, highlights its biological importance, and suggests a therapeutic
  role for inhibitors of NF-kappaB pathway activation in the treatment of WM.
