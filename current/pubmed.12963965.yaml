abstract: We performed an integrated cytogenetic study using a combination of comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH , spectral karyotyping SKY and fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH to analyze chromosomal aberrations associated with 8 human esophageal squamous
  cell carcinoma EC-SCC cell lines, and used real-time quantitative PCR Q-PCR to study
  the copy number changes of two candidate genes of chromosome 3q, PIK3CA and TP63,
  in 20 primary tumors of EC-SCC. The pooled CGH results revealed frequent gain abnormalities
  on chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 3q, 5p, 6p, 7p, 7q, 8q, 9q, 11q, 12p, 14q, 15q, 16p,
  16q, 17q, 18p, 19q, 20q, 22q, and Xq, while frequent losses were found on 3p, 4,
  5q, 6q, 7q, 9p, and 18q. SKY detected 195 translocations, 13 deletions and 2 duplications.
  Among the 374 breakpoints, most clustered at the centromeric regions, such as 8q10,
  13q10, 7q10, 9q10, 14q10, 15q10, 16q10, 21q10, and 22q10, but also at other regions,
  including 3q 3q21, 3q22, 3q25 , 7p 7p22, 7p14, 7p12 , 7q 7q21, 7q31, 7q32 , 8q 8q21.1,
  8q23 , 11q 11q21, 11q24 , 13q 13q14 and 18q 18q21 . There was a good correlation
  between the number of aberrations identified by CGH and SKY r 0.667 p 0.035 . Combined
  CGH and SKY analyses indicated that chromosomes 3, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20,
  and 22 harbored higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations than expected. FISH
  using BAC clones containing oncogene PIK3CA and TP63 found that both genes were
  amplified in 6 and 5 cell lines, respectively. Q-PCR analysis of primary tumors
  revealed amplification of PIK3CA and TP63 in 100 and 80 of the cases. Average copy
  number of PIK3CA per haploid genome was greater than that of TP63 6.27 vs 2.73 ,
  and the difference showed statistical significance p amp lt 0.001 . Combination
  of CGH, SKY and FISH could reveal detailed chromosomal changes associated with esophageal
  cancer cells, and Q-PCR could assess the change of the candidate genes in clinical
  samples in a high throughput way.
