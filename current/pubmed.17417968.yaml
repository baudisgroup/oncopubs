abstract: Typical medullary breast carcinoma MBC has recently been recognized to be
  part of the basal-like carcinoma spectrum, a feature in agreement with the high
  rate of TP53 mutations previously reported in MBCs. The present study was therefore
  designed to identify phenotypic and genetic alterations that distinguish MBCs from
  basal-like carcinomas BLC .
