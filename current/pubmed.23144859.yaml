abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Osteosarcomas are the most common non-haematological primary
  malignant tumours of bone, and all conventional osteosarcomas are high-grade tumours
  showing complex genomic aberrations. We have integrated genome-wide genetic and
  epigenetic profiles from the EuroBoNeT panel of 19 human osteosarcoma cell lines
  based on microarray technologies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cell lines showed complex
  patterns of DNA copy number changes, where genomic copy number gains were significantly
  associated with gene-rich regions and losses with gene-poor regions. By integrating
  the datasets, 350 genes were identified as having two types of aberrations gain
  over-expression, hypo-methylation over-expression, loss under-expression or hyper-methylation
  under-expression using a recurrence threshold of 6 19 30 cell lines. The genes showed
  in general alterations in either DNA copy number or DNA methylation, both within
  individual samples and across the sample panel. These 350 genes are involved in
  embryonic skeletal system development and morphogenesis, as well as remodelling
  of extracellular matrix. The aberrations of three selected genes, CXCL5, DLX5 and
  RUNX2, were validated in five cell lines and five tumour samples using PCR techniques.
  Several genes were hyper-methylated and under-expressed compared to normal osteoblasts,
  and expression could be reactivated by demethylation using 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine
  treatment for four genes tested AKAP12, CXCL5, EFEMP1 and IL11RA. Globally, there
  was as expected a significant positive association between gain and over-expression,
  loss and under-expression as well as hyper-methylation and under-expression, but
  gain was also associated with hyper-methylation and under-expression, suggesting
  that hyper-methylation may oppose the effects of increased copy number for detrimental
  genes. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative analysis of genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations
  identified dependencies and relationships between DNA copy number, DNA methylation
  and mRNA expression in osteosarcomas, contributing to better understanding of osteosarcoma
  biology.'
