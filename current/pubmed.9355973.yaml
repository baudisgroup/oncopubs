abstract: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma ILC and infiltrating ductal carcinoma IDC
  are distinguished by their histopathological appearance. However, little is known
  about the differences in genetic changes between lobular cancers and ductal cancers.
  We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH and compared aberrations in 19 ILCs
  and 46 IDCs. The total number of aberrations was lower in ILC than in IDC. While
  the average number of DNA copy number losses did not reach significance between
  them, copy number gains were significantly lower in ILCs. Fifteen of 19 ILCs 79
  showed increased copy number of 1q, and 12 cases 63 revealed loss of 16q. The presence
  of these aberrations was independent of nodal status, histologic subtypes pleomorphic
  or classic ILC , or BrdUrd-labeling index. ILCs had a higher frequency of 16q loss
  than did ductal cancers, and a lower frequency of 8q and 20q gains. Our data suggest
  that the altered growth pattern and clinical presentation which characterize infiltrating
  lobular cancers are correlated with distinct genetic alterations.
