abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and microarray expression profiling
  were used to subclassify DNA and RNA alterations associated with differential response
  to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Two to 4 Mb interval arrays were used to map
  genomic imbalances in 26 sporadic serous ovarian tumors. Cytobands 1p36, 1q42-44,
  6p22.1-p21.2, 7q32.1-q34 9q33.3-q34.3, 11p15.2, 13q12.2-q13.1, 13q21.31, 17q11.2,
  17q24.2-q25.3, 18q12.2, and 21q21.2-q21.3 were found to be statistically associated
  with chemotherapy response, and novel regions of loss at 15q11.2-q15.1 and 17q21.32-q21.33
  were identified. Gene expression profiles were obtained from a subset of these tumors
  and identified a group of genes whose differential expression was significantly
  associated with drug resistance. Within this group, five genes GAPD, HMGB2, HSC70,
  GRP58, and HMGB1 , previously shown to form a nuclear complex associated with resistance
  to DNA conformation-altering chemotherapeutic drugs in in vitro systems, may represent
  a novel class of genes associated with in vivo drug response in ovarian cancer patients.
  Although RNA expression change indicated only weak DNA copy number dependence, these
  data illustrate the value of molecular profiling at both the RNA and DNA levels
  to identify small genomic regions and gene subsets that could be associated with
  differential chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer.
