abstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma PAC is among the most lethal malignancies. While
  research has implicated multiple genes in disease pathogenesis, identification of
  therapeutic leads has been difficult and the majority of currently available therapies
  provide only marginal benefit. To address this issue, our goal was to genomically
  characterize individual PAC patients to understand the range of aberrations that
  are occurring in each tumor. Because our understanding of PAC tumorigenesis is limited,
  evaluation of separate cases may reveal aberrations, that are less common but may
  provide relevant information on the disease, or that may represent viable therapeutic
  targets for the patient. We used next generation sequencing to assess global somatic
  events across 3 PAC patients to characterize each patient and to identify potential
  targets. This study is the first to report whole genome sequencing WGS findings
  in paired tumor normal samples collected from 3 separate PAC patients. We generated
  on average 132 billion mappable bases across all patients using WGS, and identified
  142 somatic coding events including point mutations, insertion deletions, and chromosomal
  copy number variants. We did not identify any significant somatic translocation
  events. We also performed RNA sequencing on 2 of these patients apos tumors for
  which tumor RNA was available to evaluate expression changes that may be associated
  with somatic events, and generated over 100 million mapped reads for each patient.
  We further performed pathway analysis of all sequencing data to identify processes
  that may be the most heavily impacted from somatic and expression alterations. As
  expected, the KRAS signaling pathway was the most heavily impacted pathway P lt
  0.05 , along with tumor-stroma interactions and tumor suppressive pathways. While
  sequencing of more patients is needed, the high resolution genomic and transcriptomic
  information we have acquired here provides valuable information on the molecular
  composition of PAC and helps to establish a foundation for improved therapeutic
  selection.
