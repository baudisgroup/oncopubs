abstract: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma FLC is a rare entity of hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC not yet analyzed cytogenetically. By using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , we looked for chromosome changes in 2 primary FLCs and a recurrent FLC with
  and without metastases. CGH revealed an amplification of 1q in 1 primary FLC. The
  other primary FLC and a metastasis revealed no changes. The recurrent FLC showed
  18 aberrations, including 1q , 2p , 3p , 3q , 4p , 4q , 5p , 5q , 6q , 8p , 8q ,
  9q , 12p , 12q , 18p , 18q , Xp , and Xq . In 2 metastases, 9 and 10 aberrations
  were seen, including 1q , 3p-, 3q-, 4q , 5p , 5q , 8q , 10p , 10q , Xp , and Xq
  . In 9 cases of other entities of HCC, a mean of 10.2 aberrations per case were
  detectable affecting 1q 7 cases , 4q 5 , 5q 4 , 6q 5 , 8p 5 , 8q 5 , 9p 4 , 9q 5
  , 16q 4 , 17p 5 , and 17q 4 . Chromosomes 2p, 2q, 3p, 3q, 4p, 5p, 6p, 7p, 7q, 10q,
  11p, 11q, 12p, 12q, 13q, 14q, 16p, 18p, 18q, 20p, 20q, and 21q were altered in up
  to 3 samples. Our findings indicate striking differences in the number of chromosomal
  imbalances in primary FLC and recurrent FLC, whereas imbalances seen in the recurrent
  FLC and the other entities of HCC were similar in number and chromosomes involved.
  It may be speculated that these aberrations represent secondary events based on
  a genetic instability and do not mirror the primary alterations in these carcinomas.
