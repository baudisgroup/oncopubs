abstract: 'PURPOSE: Studies aimed at predicting individual responsiveness to preoperative
  chemoradiation therapy CRT are urgently needed, especially considering the risks
  associated with poorly responsive patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 3-step strategy
  for the determination of CRT sensitivity is proposed based on 1 the screening of
  a human genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP array in correlation with
  histopathologic tumor regression grade TRG 2 clinical association analysis of 113
  patients treated with preoperative CRT and 3 a cell-based functional assay for biological
  validation. RESULTS: Genome-wide screening identified 9 SNPs associated with preoperative
  CRT responses. Positive responses TRG 1-3 were obtained more frequently in patients
  carrying the reference allele C of the SNP CORO2A rs1985859 than in those with the
  substitution allele T P .01 . Downregulation of CORO2A was significantly associated
  with reduced early apoptosis by 27 P .048 and 39 P .023 in RKO and COLO320DM colorectal
  cancer cells, respectively, as determined by flow cytometry. Reduced radiosensitivity
  was confirmed by colony-forming assays in the 2 colorectal cancer cells P .034 and.015,
  respectively . The SNP FAM101A rs7955740 was not associated with radiosensitivity
  in the clinical association analysis. However, downregulation of FAM101A significantly
  reduced early apoptosis by 29 in RKO cells P .047 , and it enhanced colony formation
  in RKO cells P .001 and COLO320DM cells P .002 . CONCLUSION: CRT-sensitive SNP markers
  were identified using a novel 3-step process. The candidate marker CORO2A rs1985859
  and the putative marker FAM101A rs7955740 may be of value for the prediction of
  radiosensitivity to preoperative CRT, although further validation is needed in large
  cohorts.'
