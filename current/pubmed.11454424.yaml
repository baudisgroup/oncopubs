abstract: We analysed six malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors MPNSTs from four
  patients using metaphase preparations and compared the results with those obtained
  by using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . All six tumors showed structural
  and numerical chromosomal aberrations, mostly of chromosomes 1, 5, 7-10, 14-17,
  19, 21, and 22. The number of chromosomes per tumor cell ranged from 42 to 104.
  We could not find a recurrent specific pattern of structural changes after comparing
  the MPNSTs of different patients. However, aberrations of different tumors from
  the same patient were nearly identical. In the four patients, we found a total of
  117 breakpoints, mostly in 21q11.2 seven times , in 8q11.2 and 14q10 six times each
  , in 5q11.2 and 15q26 four times each , in 8p11.2, 10q11.2, 16q22, 19q13.3, and
  22q10 three times each . In three MPNSTs, double minute chromosomes dmin we detected
  with metaphase investigations and high-level amplifications by using CGH, respectively.
  C-MYC gene amplification and loss of the P53 gene could be ruled out by locus-specific
  probes for the common gain of 8q and for losses of 17p. When comparing the CGH results
  with those of karyotyping an overlap in the most frequent gains in 7q, 8q, 15q,
  and 17q was observed. However, we found more frequent losses in 19q in the metaphase
  investigations.
