abstract: E2A-PBX1 is expressed as a result of the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation
  in nearly 5% of cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The E2A-PBX1 chimeric
  transcription factor contains the N-terminal transactivation domain of E2A (TCF3)
  fused to the C-terminal DNA-binding homeodomain of PBX1. While there is no doubt
  of its oncogenic potential, the mechanisms of E2A-PBX1-mediated pre-B cell transformation
  and the nature of direct E2A-PBX1 target genes and pathways remain largely unknown.
  Herein we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-chip) to identify direct
  targets of E2A-PBX1, and we used gene expression arrays of siRNA E2A-PBX1-silenced
  cells to evaluate changes in expression induced by the fusion protein. Combined
  ChIP-chip and expression data analysis gave rise to direct and functional targets
  of E2A-PBX1. Further we observe that the set of ChIP-chip identified E2A-PBX1 targets
  show a collective down-regulation trend in the E2A-PBX1 silenced samples compared
  to controls suggesting an activating role of this fusion transcription factor. Our
  data suggest that the expression of the E2A-PBX1 fusion gene interferes with key
  regulatory pathways and functions of hematopoietic biology. Among these are members
  of the WNT and apoptosis/cell cycle control pathways, and thus may comprise an essential
  driving force for the propagation and maintenance of the leukemic phenotype. These
  findings may also provide evidence of potentially attractive therapeutic targets.
