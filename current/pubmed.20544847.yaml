abstract: We performed DNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization to identify
  somatic alterations specific to melanoma genome in 60 human cell lines from metastasized
  melanoma and from 44 corresponding peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our data
  showed gross but nonrandom somatic changes specific to the tumor genome. Although
  the CDKN2A 78 and PTEN 70 loci were the major targets of mono-allelic and bi-allelic
  deletions, amplifications affected loci with BRAF 53 and NRAS 12 as well as EGFR
  52 , MITF 40 , NOTCH2 35 , CCND1 18 , MDM2 18 , CCNE1 10 , and CDK4 8 . The amplified
  loci carried additional genes, many of which could potentially play a role in melanoma.
  Distinct patterns of copy number changes showed that alterations in CDKN2A tended
  to be more clustered in cell lines with mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes the
  PTEN locus was targeted mainly in conjunction with BRAF mutations. Amplification
  of CCND1, CDK4, and other loci was significantly increased in cell lines without
  BRAF-NRAS mutations and so was the loss of chromosome arms 13q and 16q. Our data
  suggest involvement of distinct genetic pathways that are driven either through
  oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations complemented by aberrations in the CDKN2A and
  PTEN genes or involve amplification of oncogenic genomic loci and loss of 13q and
  16q. It also emerges that each tumor besides being affected by major and most common
  somatic genetic alterations also acquires additional genetic alterations that could
  be crucial in determining response to small molecular inhibitors that are being
  currently pursued.
