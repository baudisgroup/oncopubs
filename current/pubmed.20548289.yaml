abstract: In addition to KIT and PDGFRA mutations, sequential accumulation of other
  genetic events is involved in the development and progression of gastrointestinal
  stromal tumors GISTs . Until recently, the significance of these other alterations
  has not been thoroughly investigated. We report the first study that integrates
  gene expression profiling and high-resolution genomic copy number analyses in GIST.
  Fresh tissue specimens from 25 patients with GIST were collected, and gene expression
  profiling and high-resolution genomic copy number analyses were performed, using
  Affymetrix U133Plus and SNP array 6.0. We found that all 21 mutant GIST patients
  showed both macroscopic cytogenetic alterations and cryptic microdeletions or amplifications,
  whereas 75 three of four of wild-type patients with GIST did not show genomic imbalances.
  The most frequently observed chromosomal alterations in patients with mutant GIST
  included 14q complete or partial deletion 17 of 25 , 1p deletion 14 of 25 and 22q
  deletion 10 of 25 . Genetic targets of the chromosomal aberrations were selected
  by integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression data. We detected the
  involvement of known oncogenes and tumor suppressors including KRAS in chr 12p amplification
  and KIF1B, PPM1A, NF2 in chr 1p, 14q and 22p deletions, respectively. The genomic
  segment most frequently altered in mutated samples was the 14q23.1 region, which
  contains potentially novel tumor suppressors, including DAAM1, RTN1 and DACT1. siRNA-mediated
  RTN1 downregulation showed evidence for the potential role in GIST pathogenesis.
  The combination of gene expression profiling and high-resolution genomic copy number
  analysis offers a detailed molecular portrait of GISTs, providing an essential comprehensive
  knowledge necessary to guide the discovery of novel target genes involved in tumor
  development and progression.
