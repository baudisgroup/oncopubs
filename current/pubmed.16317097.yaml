abstract: To identify, in high-resolution regions of DNA, the copy number changes
  associated with outcome in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL , a
  disease with an approximately 50 mortality rate, we performed array comparative
  genomic hybridization array-CGH on specimens from 64 patients with newly diagnosed
  DLBCL treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. For the entire cohort, 55 commonly
  gained lost regions, ranging in size from less than 1 Mbp to entire chromosomes,
  were identified using 1- to 2-Mbp and 2- to 4-Mbp resolution BAC arrays. Copy number
  changes of 9 minimal regions significantly correlated with overall survival, of
  which 6 were 10 Mbp or smaller. On multivariate analysis, loss of chromosomes 2
  2.4-4.1 Mbp and 16 33.8-35.6 Mbp were found to be prognostic indicators of poor
  survival, independent of clinical features routinely used to predict outcome. Loss
  of chromosome 1 78.2-79.1 Mbp was predictive of good outcome. For a subset of 55
  specimens classified according to cell-of-origin expression signature subtype, gain
  of chromosome 12 45.4-53.8 Mbp was found to be significantly associated with the
  germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL subtype. Overall, array-CGH identified relatively
  small genomic regions associated with outcome, which, along with follow-up expression
  studies, may reveal target genes important in DLBCL clinical behavior.
