abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH using bacterial artificial
  chromosomes BAC is a powerful method to analyze DNA copy number aberrations of the
  entire human genome. In fact, CGH and aCGH have revealed various DNA copy number
  aberrations in numerous cancer cells and cancer cell lines examined so far. In this
  report, BAC aCGH was applied to evaluate the stability or instability of cell lines.
  Established cell lines have greatly contributed to advancements in not only biology
  but also medical science. However, cell lines have serious problems, such as alteration
  of biological properties during long-term cultivation. Firstly, we investigated
  two cancer cell lines, HeLa and Caco-2. HeLa cells, established from a cervical
  cancer, showed significantly increased DNA copy number alterations with passage
  time. Caco-2 cells, established from a colon cancer, showed no remarkable differences
  under various culture conditions. These results indicate that BAC aCGH can be used
  for the evaluation and validation of genomic stability of cultured cells. Secondly,
  BAC aCGH was applied to evaluate and validate the genomic stabilities of three patients
  mesenchymal stem cells MSCs , which were already used for their treatments. These
  three MSCs showed no significant differences in DNA copy number aberrations over
  their entire chromosomal regions. Therefore, BAC aCGH is highly recommended for
  use for a quality check of various cells before using them for any kind of biological
  investigation or clinical application.
