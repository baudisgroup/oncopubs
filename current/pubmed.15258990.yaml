abstract: 'Analysis of cell lineage is based on the use of genetic markers inherent
  to the lineage to be analysed. The breakpoints of unbalanced translocations, and
  the pattern of chromosomal loss gain determined by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH , have been previously used to demonstrate lineages in diffuse-type gastric
  carcinoma. Signet ring cell carcinoma was shown to progress to poorly differentiated
  adenocarcinoma, and early diffuse-type gastric carcinoma to advanced diffuse-type
  gastric carcinoma. The present study focuses on poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
  with a tubular component to clarify its derivation. CGH and array CGH were applied
  to DNA extracted from multiple portions of individual tumours and amplified by degenerate
  oligonucleotide-primed DOP PCR and the changes common to the samples in each tumour
  stemline changes were compared between the tumours with and those without a tubular
  component. Within individual tumours, the samples from the tubular component and
  those from the other components had common stemline changes and a very similar frequency
  pattern of chromosomal changes, indicating their common derivation. Frequent stemline
  changes were 8q , 7p , 3q , 20q , and 10p , and these were different from those
  in the tumours without a tubular component. It was noticed that there were two subgroups
  in the tumours with a tubular component: one with 5p , 6p , 7p , and 10p , and the
  other without these changes. The latter had cytogenetic and clinicopathological
  features similar to those of the tumours without a tubular component. Analysis of
  the clonal evolution process by constructing dendrograms for each tumour gave results
  consistent with the notion that the latter subgroup may derive from signet ring
  cell carcinoma and the former from tubular adenocarcinoma.'
