abstract: Central neurocytomas are rare central nervous system neoplasms. Since the
  first description, approximately 500 cases of these tumors have been published to
  date. Nevertheless, only a limited number of genetic studies on these tumors have
  been reported. Here we investigated 20 amp quot typical amp quot central neurocytomas
  using array-based comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH with the GenoSensor
  Array 300. The functional significance of detected chromosomal aberrations harboring
  potent candidate genes was also examined at the mRNA expression level. Each tumor
  examined displayed DNA copy-number aberrations CNAs , and mean number of CNAs per
  tumor was 38.1 - 7.1 range 19-53 . Frequent gains were mapped at 2p24.1-22.1, 10q23.3-26.3,
  11q23-25, and 18q21.3-qter. Frequent losses were identified at 1pter-36.3, 1p34.3,
  6q13-21, 12q23-qter, 17p13.3, 17q11-23, and 20pter-12.3. There were 10 gained and
  23 lost single DNA clones affecting amp gt or 40 of samples tested. mRNA expression
  levels of 24 selected candidate genes harbored in these imbalanced clones were analyzed.
  MYCN, PTEN, and OR5BF1 were strongly overexpressed, whereas BIN1, SNRPN, and HRAS
  were found to be strongly underrepresented at the transcriptional level. Thus these
  data support that MYCN oncogene gain overexpression accompanied by reduced expression
  of BIN1 tumor suppressor may contribute to central neurocytoma tumorigenesis.
