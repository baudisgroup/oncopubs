abstract: Barretts oesophagus is a pre-neoplastic lesion, which develops as a complication
  of chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and predisposes the patient to oesophageal
  adenocarcinoma. Our aim was to characterize karyotypic changes that may occur during
  the progression of Barretts metaplasia through low-grade dysplasia and high-grade
  dysplasia to adenocarcinoma.
