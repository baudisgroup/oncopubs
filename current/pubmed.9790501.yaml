abstract: 'We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to evaluate DNA sequence
  copy number changes in 67 synovial sarcomas of both monophasic and biphasic histological
  subtypes. Changes mean among aberrant cases: 4.7 aberrations tumor range: 1-17 ,
  affecting most often entire chromosomes or chromosome arms, were detected in 37
  sarcomas 55 . Gains and losses were distributed equally, but different chromosomes
  were affected with variable frequencies. The most frequent aberrations, each detected
  in 9-11 of 67 tumors, were gain of 8q and gain at 12q 12q14-15 and 12q23-qter ,
  loss of 13q21-31, and loss of 3p. Other frequent changes in 7 or 8 cases included
  gains at 2p, 1q24-31, and 17q22-qter, and losses at 3cen-q23 and 10q21. High-level
  amplifications were seen in 7 cases. A total of 16 regions were detected. Two of
  them, 8p12-qter and 21q21-qter, seen in 4 and 2 tumors, respectively, were recurrent.
  No aberrations specific to histological subtype were identified. However, genetic
  changes in the monophasic tumors were more complex and numerous mean among aberrant
  cases: 5.3 aberrations tumor range: 1-17 than in the biphasic tumors mean: 2.5 aberrations
  tumor range: 1-5 , and high-level amplifications occurred more frequently. All but
  1 of the sarcomas showing high-level amplification were of the monophasic subtype.
  These findings may reflect differences in the pathogenesis and biological behavior
  of both histological subtypes of synovial sarcoma.'
