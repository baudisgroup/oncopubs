abstract: To identify sequential alterations of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome
  during colorectal cancer progression, we have analyzed tissue samples from 36 patients,
  including the complete mucosa-adenoma-carcinoma sequence from 8 patients. Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH revealed patterns of stage specific, recurrent genomic
  imbalances. Gene expression analysis on 9K cDNA arrays identified 58 genes differentially
  expressed between normal mucosa and adenoma, 116 genes between adenoma and carcinoma,
  and 158 genes between primary carcinoma and liver metastasis P amp lt 0.001 . Parallel
  analysis of our samples by CGH and expression profiling revealed a direct correlation
  of chromosomal copy number changes with chromosome-specific average gene expression
  levels. Protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and
  subsequent mass spectrometry. Although there was no direct match of differentially
  expressed proteins and genes, the majority of them belonged to identical pathways
  or networks. In conclusion, increasing genomic instability and a recurrent pattern
  of chromosomal imbalances as well as specific gene and protein expression changes
  correlate with distinct stages of colorectal cancer progression. Chromosomal aneuploidies
  directly affect average resident gene expression levels, thereby contributing to
  a massive deregulation of the cellular transcriptome. The identification of novel
  genes and proteins might deliver molecular targets for diagnostic and therapeutic
  interventions.
