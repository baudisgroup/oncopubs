abstract: Benign cystic teratoma, also known as dermoid cyst, is the most common of
  all ovarian neoplasms accounting for 10 -20 of all ovarian cysts. Most have a normal
  46,XX karyotype. Less than 2 can undergo malignant transformation. By using the
  comparative genomic hybridization technique on nine benign ovarian cysts we were
  able to show two cases with chromosomal aberrations not seen before in dermoid cysts
  but known to be involved in malignant ovarian tumors. We speculate that these are
  the tumors carrying the potential for malignant transformation.
