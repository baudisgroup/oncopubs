abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common and aggressive
  types of B-cell lymphoma. Deregulation of proto-oncogene expression following a
  translocation, most notably to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH), is one
  of the hallmarks of DLBCL. By whole genome sequencing analysis, we have identified
  thePD-L1/PD-L2locus as a recurrent translocation partner forIGHin DLBCL.PIM1andTP63were
  also identified as novel translocation partners forPD-L1/PD-L2 Fluorescence in situ
  hybridization was furthermore used to rapidly screen an expanded DLBCL cohort. Collectively,
  a subset of samples was found to be affected by gains (12%), amplifications (3%)
  and translocations (4%) of thePD-L1/PD-L2locus. RNA sequencing data coupled with
  immunohistochemistry revealed that these cytogenetic alterations correlated with
  increased expression ofPD-L1but not ofPD-L2 Moreover, cytogenetic alterations affecting
  thePD-L1/PD-L2locus were more frequently observed in the non-germinal center B-cell
  like (non-GCB) subtype of DLBCL. These findings demonstrate the genetic basis ofPD-L1overexpression
  in DLBCL and suggest that treatments targeting the PD-1-PD-L1/PD-L2 axis might benefit
  DLBCL patients, especially those belonging to the more aggressive non-GCB subtype.  Copyright
