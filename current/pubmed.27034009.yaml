abstract: In an era where mutational profiles inform treatment options, it is critical
  to know the extent to which tumor biopsies represent the molecular profile of the
  primary and metastatic tumor. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arise
  primarily in the mucosal lining of oral cavity and oropharynx. Despite aggressive
  therapy the 5-year survival rate is at 50%. The primary objective of this study
  is to characterize the degree of intratumor mutational heterogeneity in HNSCC. We
  used multi-region sequencing of paired primary and metastatic tumor DNA of 24 spatially
  distinct samples from seven patients with HNSCC of larynx, floor of the mouth (FOM)
  or oral tongue. Full length, in-depth sequencing of 202 genes implicated in cancer
  was carried out. Larynx and FOM tumors had more than 69.2% unique SNVs between the
  paired primary and metastatic lesions. In contrast, the oral tongue HNSCC had only
  33.3% unique SNVs across multiple sites. In addition, HNSCC of the oral tongue had
  fewer mutations than larynx and FOM tumors. These findings were validated on the
  Affymetrix whole genome 6.0 array platform and were consistent with data from The
  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This is the first report demonstrating differences in
  mutational heterogeneity varying by subsite in HNSCC. The heterogeneity within laryngeal
  tumor specimens may lead to an underestimation of the genetic abnormalities within
  tumors and may foster resistance to standard treatment protocols. These findings
  are relevant to investigators and clinicians developing personalized cancer treatments
  based on identification of specific mutations in tumor biopsies.
