abstract: In a strategy to identify novel genes involved in glioma pathogenesis by
  molecular characterization of chromosomal translocation breakpoints, we identified
  the KIAA1797 gene, encoding a protein with an as yet undefined function, to be disrupted
  by a 7 9 translocation in a primary glioblastoma culture. Array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization detected deletions involving KIAA1797 in around half of glioblastoma
  cell lines and glioblastomas investigated. Quantification of messenger RNA levels
  in human tissues demonstrated highest KIAA1797 expression in brain, reduced levels
  in all glioblastoma cell lines and most glioblastomas and similar levels in glial
  and neuronal cells by analysis of different hippocampal regions from murine brain.
  Antibodies against KIAA1797 were generated and showed similar protein levels in
  cortex and subcortical white matter of human brain, while levels were significantly
  reduced in glioblastomas with KIAA1797 deletion. By immunofluorescence of astrocytoma
  cells, KIAA1797 co-localized with vinculin in focal adhesions. Physical interaction
  between KIAA1797 and vinculin was demonstrated via co-immunoprecipitation. Functional
  in vitro assays demonstrated a significant decrease in colony formation, migration
  and invasion capacity of LN18 and U87MG glioma cells carrying a homozygous KIAA1797
  deletion ectopically expressing KIAA1797 compared with mock-transduced cells. In
  an in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse model, U87MG tumour lesions expressing KIAA1797
  had a significantly reduced volume compared to tumours not expressing KIAA1797.
  In summary, the frequently deleted KIAA1797 gene encodes a novel focal adhesion
  complex protein with tumour suppressor function in gliomas, which we name focadhesin.
  Since KIAA1797 genetic variation has been implicated in Alzheimers disease, our
  data are also relevant for neurodegeneration.
