abstract: Acquired uniparental disomy aUPD is a common feature of cancer genomes,
  leading to loss of heterozygosity. aUPD is associated not only with loss-of-function
  mutations of tumour suppressor genes, but also with gain-of-function mutations of
  proto-oncogenes. Here we show unique gain-of-function mutations of the C-CBL also
  known as CBL tumour suppressor that are tightly associated with aUPD of the 11q
  arm in myeloid neoplasms showing myeloproliferative features. The C-CBL proto-oncogene,
  a cellular homologue of v-Cbl, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negatively regulates
  signal transduction of tyrosine kinases. Homozygous C-CBL mutations were found in
  most 11q-aUPD-positive myeloid malignancies. Although the C-CBL mutations were oncogenic
  in NIH3T3 cells, c-Cbl was shown to functionally and genetically act as a tumour
  suppressor. C-CBL mutants did not have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, but inhibited
  that of wild-type C-CBL and CBL-B also known as CBLB , leading to prolonged activation
  of tyrosine kinases after cytokine stimulation. c-Cbl - - haematopoietic stem progenitor
  cells HSPCs showed enhanced sensitivity to a variety of cytokines compared to c-Cbl  HSPCs,
  and transduction of C-CBL mutants into c-Cbl - - HSPCs further augmented their sensitivities
  to a broader spectrum of cytokines, including stem-cell factor SCF, also known as
  KITLG , thrombopoietin TPO, also known as THPO , IL3 and FLT3 ligand FLT3LG , indicating
  the presence of a gain-of-function that could not be attributed to a simple loss-of-function.
  The gain-of-function effects of C-CBL mutants on cytokine sensitivity of HSPCs largely
  disappeared in a c-Cbl  background or by co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL, which
  suggests the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most
  cases of C-CBL-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Our findings provide a new insight into
  a role of gain-of-function mutations of a tumour suppressor associated with aUPD
  in the pathogenesis of some myeloid cancer subsets.
