abstract: Disease recurrence and metastasis are frequently observed in many successfullytreated
  localized cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma in which intrahepatic and
  extrahepatic recurrence metastasis are frequently observed after curative resection.
  The present study aimed at identifying metastasis-associated genes through delineation
  of the clonality for multinodular liver cancer. The clonal relationship of 22 tumor
  foci from six patients was investigated by the genome-wide expression profile via
  cDNA microarray consisting of 23,000 genes. Tumor molecular properties including
  p53 protein overexpression and gene mutation, hepatitis B virus integration pattern,
  and genetic alteration examined by comparative genomic hybridization were compared.
  Results indicated that gene expression patterns could serve as the molecular fingerprint
  for clonality identification. Together with the molecular data from p53, hepatitis
  B virus integration and comparative genomic hybridization profiles, tumor nodules
  from five patients were confirmed with clonal relationship, and the expression profiles
  of the primary nodules were compared with their corresponding intrahepatic metastatic
  nodules. A total of 90 clones were found to be correlated with intrahepatic metastasis
  by Students t test P amp lt 0.05 . With reference to the primary tumor, 63 clones
  39 known genes and 24 express sequence tags were down-regulated whereas 27 clones
  14 known genes and 13 express sequence tags were up-regulated in the metastatic
  nodules. These metastasis-associated genes may provide clues to reveal patients
  with increased risk of developing metastasis, and to identify novel therapeutic
  targets for the treatment of metastasis.
