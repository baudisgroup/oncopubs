abstract: "Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are the most common cancer in young
  men. Here we perform whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 42 TGCTs to comprehensively
  study the cancer's mutational profile. The mutation rate is uniformly low in all
  of the tumours (mean 0.5 mutations per Mb) as compared with common cancers, consistent
  with the embryological origin of TGCT. In addition to expected copy number gain
  of chromosome 12p and mutation of KIT, we identify recurrent mutations in the tumour
  suppressor gene CDC27 (11.9%). Copy number analysis reveals recurring amplification
  of the spermatocyte development gene FSIP2 (15.3%) and a 0.4Ã¢\x80\x89Mb region at
  Xq28 (15.3%). Two treatment-refractory patients are shown to harbour XRCC2 mutations,
  a gene strongly implicated in defining cisplatin resistance. Our findings provide
  further insights into genes involved in the development and progression of TGCT."
