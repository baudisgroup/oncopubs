abstract: The diagnosis of salivary gland myoepithelioma, an entity with heterogeneous
  cytomorphology and inconsistent immunophenotype, rests on conventional histology.
  However, the clinical course cannot be predicted reliably from cytomorphological
  and immunophenotypic analysis. The present study determined the immunophenotype
  of a representative series of 12 myoepitheliomas and 21 malignant myoepitheliomas.
  Among the seven markers tested, antibodies against cytokeratins 5 6, S-100 protein,
  and vimentin produced the most consistent reactivity profile. Comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH profiles of 12 myoepitheliomas showed chromosomal losses in three
  of 12 cases. In myoepithelial carcinomas, however, ten of 19 tissues investigated
  by CGH lacked detectable cytogenetic aberrations. In five cases, aberrations involved
  chromosome 8, in line with observations in salivary gland carcinomas of other differentiation.
  One case that was represented in three separately localized manifestations of the
  disease proved informative as to the relevance of gross aberration for tumour development,
  as these tumours differed in their CGH profiles. Staining for cytokeratins 5 6 is
  a useful addition to the established immunohistological marker panel in the work-up
  of myoepitheliomas, because of its reliable expression in most cases and because
  it may underline the epithelial nature of the lesion. CGH proved to be of limited
  value as a diagnostic adjunct the presence of numerous gross cytogenetic aberrations
  should raise the suspicion of malignancy. The low frequency of aberrations detectable
  by CGH in overtly malignant myoepithelial neoplasms suggests that gross cytogenetic
  alterations were acquired in the course of tumour progression and points to the
  relevance of genetic changes not resolved by CGH.
