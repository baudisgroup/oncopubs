abstract: SÃ©zary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)
  of unknown etiology in which malignant cells circulate in the peripheral blood.
  To identify viral elements, gene fusions, and gene expression patterns associated
  with this lymphoma, flow cytometry was used to obtain matched pure populations of
  malignant SÃ©zary cells (SCs) versus nonmalignant CD4(+) T cells from 3 patients
  for whole transcriptome, paired-end sequencing with an average depth of 112 million
  reads per sample. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes identified
  mis-regulation of PI3K/Akt, TGFÎ², and NF-ÎºB pathways as well as T-cell receptor
  signaling. Bioinformatic analysis did not detect either nonhuman transcripts to
  support a viral etiology of SS or recurrently expressed gene fusions, but it did
  identify 21 SC-associated annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Transcriptome
  assembly by multiple algorithms identified 13 differentially expressed unannotated
  transcripts termed SÃ©zary cell-associated transcripts (SeCATs) that include 12
  predicted lncRNAs and a novel transcript with coding potential. High-throughput
  sequencing targeting the 3' end of polyadenylated transcripts in archived tumors
  from 24 additional patients with tumor-stage CTCL confirmed the differential expression
  of SC-associated lncRNAs and SeCATs in CTCL. Our findings characterize the SS transcriptome
  and support recent reports that implicate lncRNA dysregulation in human malignancies.
