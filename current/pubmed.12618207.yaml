abstract: Intramuscular lipomas are uncommon benign mesenchymal tumors which infiltrate
  skeletal muscle and are exceedingly rare in the head and neck region. Because of
  the infiltrating nature of the lesion and a high propensity for recurrence, they
  are sometimes difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated liposarcomas WDLS
  . We report, the first case of an infiltrating lipoma of the temporal muscle in
  a 62-year-old white man who presented with a slow growing mass in the left temporal
  region. The histopathological examination showed diffuse infiltration of the striated
  muscle fibers by mature adipocytes. There were no lipoblasts or cells with atypical
  nuclei as described in WDLS. We performed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH analyses using painting probes for chromosome 12 and a specific probe for the
  MDM2 gene and comparative genomic hybridization. The results did not identify MDM2
  or 12q amplification and therefore confirmed the benign nature of the lesion.
