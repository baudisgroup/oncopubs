abstract: Coamplification of multiple segments of chromosome 2, including an MYCN-bearing
  segment, was examined in 2 cancer cell lines, NCI-H69 lung cancer and IMR-32 neuroblastoma
  . High-resolution array-CGH analysis revealed 13 and 6 highly amplified segments
  located at different sites in chromosome 2 in NCI-H69 and IMR-32, respectively.
  FISH analysis demonstrated that these segments were co-localized in double minutes
  in NCI-H69 and in homogeneously staining regions in IMR-32. Connectivity of the
  segments was determined by a PCR assay using designed primer sets. It was found
  that all the segments were connected to each other irrespective of their order and
  orientation against the genome sequence, and a single chain-like cluster was configured
  in both cell lines. Such patchwork structures of the amplicons suggest the possibility
  that massive genomic rearrangements, explained by the single catastrophic event
  model, are involved in the formation of the amplicons, enabling the coamplification
  of different chromosomal regions including the MYCN locus. The model comprises massive
  fragmentation of chromosomes and random rejoining of the fragments.
