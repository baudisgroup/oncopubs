abstract: Disappearance of the Barr body is considered a hallmark of cancer, although
  whether this corresponds to genetic loss or to epigenetic instability and transcriptional
  reactivation is unclear. Here we show that breast tumors and cell lines frequently
  display major epigenetic instability of the inactive X chromosome, with highly abnormal
  3D nuclear organization and global perturbations of heterochromatin, including gain
  of euchromatic marks and aberrant distributions of repressive marks such as H3K27me3
  and promoter DNA methylation. Genome-wide profiling of chromatin and transcription
  reveal modified epigenomic landscapes in cancer cells and a significant degree of
  aberrant gene activity from the inactive X chromosome, including several genes involved
  in cancer promotion. We demonstrate that many of these genes are aberrantly reactivated
  in primary breast tumors, and we further demonstrate that epigenetic instability
  of the inactive X can lead to perturbed dosage of X-linked factors. Taken together,
  our study provides the first integrated analysis of the inactive X chromosome in
  the context of breast cancer and establishes that epigenetic erosion of the inactive
  X can lead to the disappearance of the Barr body in breast cancer cells. This work
  offers new insights and opens up the possibility of exploiting the inactive X chromosome
  as an epigenetic biomarker at the molecular and cytological levels in cancer.  ï¿½
