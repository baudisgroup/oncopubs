abstract: 'Invasive ductal carcinomas IDCs and invasive lobular carcinomas ILCs are
  the two major pathological types of breast cancer. Epidemiological and histoclinical
  data suggest biological differences, but little is known about the molecular alterations
  involved in ILCs. We undertook a comparative large-scale study by both array-compared
  genomic hybridization and cDNA microarray of a set of 50 breast tumors 21 classic
  ILCs and 29 IDCs selected on homogeneous histoclinical criteria. Results were validated
  on independent tumor sets, as well as by quantitative RT-PCR. ILCs and IDCs presented
  differences at both the genomic and expression levels with ILCs being less rearranged
  and heterogeneous than IDCs. Supervised analysis defined a 75-BACs signature discriminating
  accurately ILCs from IDCs. Expression profiles identified two subgroups of ILCs:
  typical ILCs approximately 50 , which were homogeneous and displayed a normal-like
  molecular pattern, and atypical ILCs, more heterogeneous with features intermediate
  between ILCs and IDCs. Supervised analysis identified a 75-gene expression signature
  that discriminated ILCs from IDCs, with many genes involved in cell adhesion, motility,
  apoptosis, protein folding, extracellular matrix and protein phosphorylation. Although
  ILCs and IDCs share common alterations, our data show that ILCs and IDCs could be
  distinguished on the basis of their genomic and expression profiles suggesting that
  they evolve along distinct genetic pathways.'
