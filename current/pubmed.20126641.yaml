abstract: BACKGROUND:Colon cancer CRC development often includes chromosomal instability
  CIN leading to amplifications and deletions of large DNA segments. Epidemiological,
  clinical, and cytogenetic studies showed that there are considerable differences
  between CRC tumors from African Americans AAs and Caucasian patients. In this study,
  we determined genomic copy number aberrations in sporadic CRC tumors from AAs, in
  order to investigate possible explanations for the observed disparities.METHODOLOGY
  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We applied genome-wide array comparative genome hybridization
  aCGH using a 105k chip to identify copy number aberrations in samples from 15 AAs.
  In addition, we did a population comparative analysis with aCGH data in Caucasians
  as well as with a widely publicized list of colon cancer genes CAN genes . There
  was an average of 20 aberrations per patient with more amplifications than deletions.
  Analysis of DNA copy number of frequently altered chromosomes revealed that deletions
  occurred primarily in chromosomes 4, 8 and 18. Chromosomal duplications occurred
  in more than 50 of cases on chromosomes 7, 8, 13, 20 and X. The CIN profile showed
  some differences when compared to Caucasian alterations.CONCLUSIONS SIGNIFICANCE:Chromosome
  X amplification in male patients and chromosomes 4, 8 and 18 deletions were prominent
  aberrations in AAs. Some CAN genes were altered at high frequencies in AAs with
  EXOC4, EPHB6, GNAS, MLL3 and TBX22 as the most frequently deleted genes and HAPLN1,
  ADAM29, SMAD2 and SMAD4 as the most frequently amplified genes. The observed CIN
  may play a distinctive role in CRC in AAs.
