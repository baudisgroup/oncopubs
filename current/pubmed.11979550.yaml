abstract: In order to investigate the genetics of testicular germ cell tumors TGCTs
  , we examined 33 TGCTs, including 15 familial bilateral and 18 sporadic tumors,
  using comparative genomic hybridization. The frequencies of the histological subtypes
  were comparable between the two groups. Gains of the whole or parts of chromosome
  12 were found in 30 tumors 91 . Furthermore, increased copy number of the whole
  or parts of chromosomes 7, 8, 17, and X, and decreased copy number of the whole
  or parts of chromosomes 4, 11, 13, and 18 were observed in amp gt or 50 of the tumors.
  Sixteen smallest regions of overlapping changes were delineated on 12 different
  chromosomes. The chromosomal copy numbers of familial bilateral and sporadic TGCTs
  were comparable, suggesting similar genetic pathways to disease in both groups.
  However, significant differences were observed between the two main histological
  subgroups. Gains from 15q and 22q were associated with seminomas P 0.005 and P 0.02,
  respectively , whereas gain of the proximal 17q 17q11.2-21 and high-level amplification
  from chromosome arm 12p, and losses from 10q were associated with nonseminomas P
  amp lt 0.001, P 0.04, and P 0.03, respectively .
