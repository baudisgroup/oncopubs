abstract: 'We have examined 11 cases of childhood adrenocortical tumours for copy
  number changes using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The changes seen are
  highly consistent between cases, and are independent of tumour type carcinoma versus
  adenoma or the presence of a germline TP53 mutation. The regions of chromosomal
  gain and loss identified in this study indicate the location of genes that are potentially
  important in the development and progression of childhood adrenocortical tumours.
  Finally, the copy number changes identified in childhood tumours are distinctly
  different to those seen in adult cases Kjellman et al 1996 Cancer Res 56: 4219-4223
  , and we propose that this indicates that childhood tumours are of embryonal origin.'
