abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect chromosomal gains
  and losses in a series of 90 frozen soft tissue primary tumors STTs , all untreated.
  The material consisted of 69 malignant sarcomas, including 20 malignant fibrous
  histiocytomas MFH , 23 liposarcomas LPS , 6 leiomyosarcomas LMS , 4 synovial sarcomas,
  4 primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETs , and various others subtypes, in addition
  to 21 benign tumors. Within the benign tumors, only 2 of the 3 schwannomas showed
  genetic changes. In malignant sarcomas, genetic changes were detected in 64 of the
  69 samples analyzed 92 , with a mean of 4.5 per sample range 0-10 . Gains and losses
  on chromosome 13 were observed in 32 of the sarcomas with genomic imbalance. Recurring
  low-level copy number increases were found at new sites on chromosomes 7 6 MFH samples,
  30 and 8 10 LPS samples, 43 , the minimal common regions being 7p15-pter and 8q24.
  No new recurring high-level amplifications were found. Surprisingly, losses of DNA
  sequences were more frequent than gains particularly, losses were the main feature
  in LMS, with highly recurrent common minimal losses at 11q14-qter and 13q21-q22
  4 samples, 66 , and 5 samples, 83 , respectively . Losses of chromosome 2 sequences
  minimal common regions at 2p24-pter and 2q32-qter were observed in 50 of the MFH
  analyzed. New recurrent losses of whole or part of chromosome 14 were found in 57
  of the pleomorphic LPS PLPS analyzed. This study uncovers new clues for the diagnosis
  of malignant STTs and shows the importance of deletions as events in the early steps
  involved in the tumorigenesis of STTs.
