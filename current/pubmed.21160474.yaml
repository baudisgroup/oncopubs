abstract: Little is known of the genetic architecture of cancer at the subclonal and
  single-cell level or in the cells responsible for cancer clone maintenance and propagation.
  Here we have examined this issue in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in which
  the ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion is an early or initiating genetic lesion followed by
  a modest number of recurrent or driver copy number alterations. By multiplexing
  fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic
  abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones
  identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral
  trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics
  and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations
  are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients,
  and in no preferential order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change
  in the lead-up to a diagnosis and in relapse. Leukaemia propagating cells, assayed
  by serial transplantation in NOD SCID IL2R null mice, are also genetically variegated,
  mirroring subclonal patterns, and vary in competitive regenerative capacity in vivo.
  These data have implications for cancer genomics and for the targeted therapy of
  cancer.
