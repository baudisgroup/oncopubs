abstract: 'We evaluated the WT1 and IGF2 status and performed chromosome and or comparative
  genomic hybridization analysis in 43 tumor samples from patients with Wilms tumor.
  On this basis, we classified them into 4 groups: WT1 abnormality, loss of heterozygosity
  LOH of IGF2, loss of imprinting LOI of IGF2, and retention of imprinting ROI of
  IGF2, which were seen in 12 , 30 , 16 , and 42 of the tumors, respectively. Patients
  in the LOI group were older than those in other groups P amp lt 0.01 , and tumors
  in the WT1 group had fewer cytogenetic changes than did those in the other groups
  P amp lt 0.01 . It was found that 11q- and 12 were more frequent in the LOI group
  than in the WT1 LOH ROI group P amp lt 0.01 and P amp lt 0.01 . There was no difference
  in the incidence of 16q- between the LOI group and the other groups however, when
  we excluded 16 tumors with LOH on 11p15, 16q- tended to be more frequent in the
  LOI group than in the WT1 ROI group P 0.06 . The association of 11q- or 12 with
  LOI of IGF2 found in the present study suggests that many tumors with no WT1 abnormalities
  need overexpression of IGF2 together with biallelic inactivation of the tumor-suppressor
  gene on 11q and or overexpression of growth-promoting genes on chromosome 12. The
  11q gene may code for one of the proteins that constitute a CTCF insulator complex,
  and its mutation, deletion, or haploinsufficiency may cause insulator abnormalities
  that might lead to LOI of IGF2.'
