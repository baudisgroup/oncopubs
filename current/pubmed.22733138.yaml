abstract: MicroRNAs have been implicated as important mediators of cancer cell homeostasis,
  and accumulating data suggest compelling roles for them in the apoptosis pathway.
  X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP is a potent caspase inhibitor and an
  important barrier to apoptotic cell death, but the mechanisms that determine the
  diverse range of XIAP expression seen in cancer remains unclear. In this study,
  we present evidence that miR-24 directly targets the 3UTR of the XIAP messenger
  RNA mRNA to exert translational repression. Using a heuristic algorithm of bioinformatics
  analysis and in vitro screening, we identified miR-24 as a candidate regulator of
  XIAP expression. Array comparative genomic hybridization and spectral karyotype
  analysis reveal that genomic copy number loss at the miR-24 locus is concordant
  with the loss of endogenous miR-24 in cancer cells. Using a luciferase construct
  of the XIAP 3UTR, we showed that miR-24 specifically coordinates to the XIAP mRNA.
  Interference with miR-24s binding of the critical seed region, resulting from site-directed
  mutagenesis of the 3UTR, significantly abrogated miR-24s effects on XIAP expression.
  Moreover, miR-24 overexpression can overcome apoptosis resistance in cancer cells
  via downregulation of XIAP expression, and the resulting cancer cell death induced
  by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand is executed by the canonical
  caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanism
  by which miR-24 directly modulates XIAP expression level and consequently the apoptosis
  threshold in cancer cells.
