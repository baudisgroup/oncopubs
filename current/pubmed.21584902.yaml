abstract: It is commonly accepted that cancer cell progression is accompanied by accumulation
  of genetic changes. Here we searched for copy number variations in melanoma and
  asked whether homozygous losses always cumulate during tumor cell progression. Therefore
  we investigated either melanoma cell lines or tissue derived from the primary lesion
  and from the lymph node metastasis of the same individual patient. In vitro studies
  of melanoma cell lines revealed high migratory and anchorage independent growth
  of metastasis-derived cells. Surprisingly, whole genome DNA analysis of a primum-derived
  cell line revealed a total of 10 homozygous losses, whereas the matched metastasis-derived
  cell line only shared five of those losses. We further tested these cells in a mouse
  model for intradermal melanoma growth and detected fast growth of the metastasis-derived
  cell line and no growth of primum-derived cells. Additionally, we screened matched
  pairs of patient-derived melanoma primum and metastasis samples and we could also
  identify a case with homozygous deletions exclusively present in the primary lesion.
  Therefore, we suggest that tumor cell progression at the metastatic niche can occur
  parallel and independently from the primary tumor. We propose that for mutation-targeted
  therapy genotyping should be performed not only from primary, but also from metastatic
  melanoma.
