abstract: Paragangliomas PGLs of the head and neck are benign neoplasms derived from
  the autonomic nervous system. Familial PGLs have been associated with germline mutations
  in succinate dehydrogenase SDH genes, and occasionally in Von Hippel-Lindau VHL
  and RET. The aim of this study was to compare somatic DNA copy number changes in
  tumors of familial and sporadic origin.
