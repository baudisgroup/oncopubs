abstract: Increasing clinical and pathological evidence suggests that malignant fibrous
  histiocytomas MFH comprise a heterogeneous tumor group. In a series of 108 MFH tested
  by comparative genomic hybridization, we found in 22 tumors high-level coamplification
  of the 12q14 approximately q15 chromosome region with other loci, a genetics strongly
  reminiscent of what has been observed for well-differentiated liposarcomas. Nevertheless,
  these MFH differ from liposarcomas by a high recurrence of coamplified partners
  because coamplified loci were seen at 1p32 in nine cases, 6q23 in seven cases, and
  12q24 in six cases. The same recurrence was observed in a series of dedifferentiated
  liposarcomas, but not in a series of well-differentiated liposarcomas. These observations
  demonstrate that a subgroup of MFH share a genetic partner very similar to that
  observed in liposarcomas, and suggest that the undifferentiated status of these
  tumors is closely related to the amplifications of specific chromosome loci.
