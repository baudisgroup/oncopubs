abstract: "Cytogenetic analyses of a consecutive series of 67 paediatric (median age
  8Â years; range 0-17) de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients revealed aberrations
  in 55 (82%) cases. The most common subgroups were KMT2A rearrangement (29%), normal
  karyotype (15%), RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (10%), deletions of 5q, 7q and/or 17p (9%), myeloid
  leukaemia associated with Down syndrome (7%), PML-RARA (7%) and CBFB-MYH11 (5%).
  Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analysis and exon sequencing of 100
  genes, performed in 52 and 40 cases, respectively (39 overlapping), revealed â\x89¥1
  aberration in 89%; when adding cytogenetic data, this frequency increased to 98%.
  Uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs) were detected in 13% and copy number aberrations
  (CNAs) in 63% (median 2/case); three UPIDs and 22 CNAs were recurrent. Twenty-two
  genes were targeted by focal CNAs, including AEBP2 and PHF6 deletions and genes
  involved in AML-associated gene fusions. Deep sequencing identified mutations in
  65% of cases (median 1/case). In total, 60 mutations were found in 30 genes, primarily
  those encoding signalling proteins (47%), transcription factors (25%), or epigenetic
  modifiers (13%). Twelve genes (BCOR, CEBPA, FLT3, GATA1, KIT, KRAS, NOTCH1, NPM1,
  NRAS, PTPN11, SMC3 and TP53) were recurrently mutated. We conclude that SNP-A and
  deep sequencing analyses complement the cytogenetic diagnosis of paediatric AML.
