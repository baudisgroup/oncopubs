abstract: 'Small bowel adenocarcinoma SBA is a rare cancer and consequently, the options
  for clinical trials are limited. As they are treated according to either a colorectal
  or a gastric cancer regimen and the molecular biology of a tumor is a pivotal determinant
  for therapy response, chromosomal copy number aberrations were compared with the
  colorectal and gastric adenocarcinomas. Materials and methods: A total of 85 microsatellite
  stable MSS adenocarcinomas from the stomach, colorectum and small bowel were selected
  from existing array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH datasets. We compared
  the aCGH profiles of the three tumor sites by supervised analysis and hierarchical
  clustering.'
