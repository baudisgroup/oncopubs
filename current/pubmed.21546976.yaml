abstract: This study evaluated the clinicopathological and prognostic implications
  of genetic alterations characterizing oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC . Comparative
  genomic hybridization CGH was used to identify chromosomal alterations present in
  primary OSCCs obtained from 97 pateints. In this population, tobacco use was a significant
  risk factor for OSCC. By contrast, all 97 of our samples are negative for human
  papillomavirus HPV DNA integration, which is another known risk factor for OSCC
  in certain populations. Results of the Fishers exact test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg
  correction for multiple testing, showed a correlation of 7p gain and 8p loss with
  node-positive OSCC p 0.04 for both genetic alterations and association of 11q13
  gain with high-grade OSCC p 0.05 . Univariate Cox-proportional hazard models, also
  corrected for multiple testing, showed significant association of 11q13 gain and
  18q loss with decreased survival p 0.05 . These findings were supported by multivariate
  analysis which revealed that 11q13 gain and 18q loss together serve as a strong
  bivariate predictor of poor prognosis. In conclusion, our study has identified genetic
  alterations that correlate significantly with nodal status, grade, and poor survival
  status of OSCC. These potential biomarkers may aid the current TNM system for better
  prediction of clinical outcome.
