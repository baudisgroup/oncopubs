abstract: Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma PCGD-TCL , which originates
  from activated mature gamma-delta T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype is a rare T-cell
  lymphoproliferative disease. The prognosis of PCGD-TCL has been rather unfavorable
  due to poor response to conventional chemotherapy, and its molecular features and
  pathophysiology underlying disease development remain unknown. We report here a
  case with primarily treatment-resistant PCGD-TCL featuring highly complex cytogenetic
  and genetic aberrations detected by spectral karyotyping and genome-wide single
  nucleotide polymorphism SNP array. Chromosomal aberrations included several chromosomal
  translocations involving breakpoints at 9p21, 14q11.2, 14q32.1, or 16q23.1, suggesting
  the involvement of WWOX, TCL gene cluster, and BCL11B, which are crucial for tumorigenesis
  in T-cell lymphomas. SNP analysis also identified genome copy number gains and losses
  in various regions, which can potently deregulate expression of various pro- and
  anti-oncogenic genes involved in RAS-related protein pathways, PI3K AKT MTOR-related
  pathways, MYC-related signaling, or TP53-related signaling. Thus, this case report
  may shed some light on the complex molecular abnormalities involved in the development
  of PCGD-TCL and on information that can aid the search for druggable target molecules
  in this disease.
