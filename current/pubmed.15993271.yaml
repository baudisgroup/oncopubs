abstract: Much information has been reported on the genetic and genomic alterations
  in colorectal cancer CRC in various countries however, nonrandom chromosomal alterations
  in Thai patients have not been described. As a first step toward understanding the
  underlying genetic changes and determining early chromosomal changes of tumor development
  in this population, we used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to screen for
  losses and gains of DNA sequences along chromosomes in 20 morphologically normal
  tumor surroundings MNTS and 40 CRC tissues from 40 patients. In CRC, we detected
  gains of chromosome arms 20q 60 , 8q 25 , 19q 22.5 , and 19p 20 , as well as losses
  of chromosome arms 18q 25 and 4q 20 . There were no differences in genetic alteration
  between colon and rectal cancer. In morphologically normal tumor surroundings MNTS
  tissues, gains on 19p and 19q were most frequent. We suggest that gains of this
  chromosome are early events in the progression of CRC, followed by gains on 8q and
  20q and losses on 4q and 18q at later stages. Based on our cytogenetic data by comparison
  of 2 tissue groups in the same cases, we discuss the monoclonal model followed by
  lateral epithelial spread as an explanation of multiple CRC. Identification and
  characterization of the causative genes for these cancer syndromes have enabled
  precise pre-symptomatic detection of mutations in individuals who bear a prior risk
  of developing CRC.
