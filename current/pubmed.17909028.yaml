abstract: Telomere attrition ultimately leads to the activation of protective cellular
  responses, such as apoptosis or senescence. Impairment of such mechanisms can allow
  continued proliferation despite the presence of dysfunctional telomeres. Under such
  conditions, high levels of genome instability are often engendered. Data from both
  mouse and human model systems indicate that a period of genome instability might
  facilitate tumorigenesis. Here, we use a liposarcoma model system to assay telomere
  maintenance mechanism TMM -specific genetic alterations. A multiassay approach was
  used to assess the TMMs active in tumors. Genomic DNA from these samples was then
  analyzed by high-resolution DNA mapping array to identify genetic alterations. Our
  data reveal a higher level of genome instability in alternative lengthening of telomere
  ALT -positive tumors compared with telomerase-positive tumors, whereas tumors lacking
  both mechanisms have relatively low levels of genome instability. The bulk of the
  genetic changes are amplifications, regardless of the mode of telomere maintenance
  used. We also identified genetic changes specific to the ALT mechanism e.g., deletion
  of chromosome 1q32.2-q44 as well as changes that are underrepresented among ALT-positive
  tumors, such as amplification of chromosome 12q14.3-q21.2. Taken together, these
  studies provide insight into the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of
  ALT and reveal several loci that might be exploited either as prognostic markers
  or targets of chemotherapeutic intervention.
