abstract: 'Although recurrent chromosomal alterations occur in chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL , relatively few affected tumor suppressors and oncogenes have been
  implicated. To improve genetic characterization of CLL, we performed high-resolution
  gene copy number analysis of 20 CLL patients using oligonucleotide array comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH . The most recurrent losses were observed in 13q and
  11q with variable sizes. The 11q losses varied between 7.44 Mb and 41.72 Mb in size
  and targeted ATM among others. Lost regions in 13q were generally smaller, spanning
  from 0.79 Mb to 29.33 Mb. The minimal common region 158 kb in 13q14.3, which was
  also homozygously deleted in some cases, harbored five genes: TRIM13, KCNRG, DLEU2,
  DLEU1, and FAM10A4. Additionally, two micro-RNA genes MIRN15A and MIRN16-1 locate
  to the region. New cryptic losses were detected in 1q23.2-- amp gt q23.3, 3p21.31,
  16pter-- amp gt p13.3, 17p13.3-- amp gt p13.2, 17q25.3-- amp gt qter, and 22q11.22.
  In conclusion, our oligonucleotide aCGH study revealed novel aberrations and provided
  detailed genomic profiles of the altered regions.'
