abstract: Cell lines and xenografts derived from medulloblastomas are useful tools
  to investigate the chromosomal changes in these tumors. Here we used G-banding,
  fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , spectral karyotyping SKY , and comparative
  genomic hybridization to study 4 medulloblastoma cell lines and 1 xenograft. Cell
  line D-425 Med had a relatively simple karyotype, with a terminal deletion of 10q
  and amplification of MYC in double-minutes dmins . FISH demonstrated that an apparent
  isochromosome 17q by routine karyotyping was actually an unbalanced translocation
  between 2 copies of chromosome 17. Cell line D-556 Med also had a simple near-diploid
  stemline with an unbalanced 1 13 translocation resulting in a gain of 1q, an isochromosome
  17q , and dmins. These findings were initially described using routine G-banded
  preparations, and FISH showed that the dmins were an amplification of MYC and the
  i 17q was an isodicentric 17q chromosome. The other finding was confirmed by FISH,
  SKY, and comparative genomic hybridization. Cell lines D-721 Med and D-581 Med had
  complex karyotypic patterns that could be completely characterized only when FISH
  and SKY were used. Xenograft D-690 Med also had a complex pattern that FISH and
  SKY were helpful in completely elucidating. Interestingly, balanced reciprocal translocations
  were seen as well as complicated unbalanced translocations and marker chromosomes.
  Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated only a deletion of 10q22-10q24, supporting
  the idea that despite the complexity of the chromosomal rearrangements, minimal
  alterations in the overall chromosomal content had occurred. This study demonstrates
  that routine cytogenetic preparations are adequate to describe chromosomal abnormalities
  in occasional medulloblastoma samples, but a broader spectrum of molecular cytogenetic
  methods is required to completely analyze most of these tumor samples.
