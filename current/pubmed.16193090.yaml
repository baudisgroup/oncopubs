abstract: Gain of chromosome 18q and translocation t 14 18 are frequently found in
  B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas B-NHL . Increased BCL2 transcription and BCL2 protein
  expression have been suggested to be the result of the gain. We utilized FISH, PCR
  and array CGH to study BCL2 and chromosome 18 copy number changes and rearrangements
  in 93 cases of B-NHL. BCL2 protein was expressed in amp gt 75 of the tumor cells
  in 92 of the cases by immunohistochemistry. Gain of BCL2 was associated with a 25
  increase in BCL2 expression levels immunoblotting , whereas t 14 18 resulted in
  a 55 increase in BCL2 levels compared to cases without BCL2 alterations. The tumor
  cell spontaneous apoptotic fractions were similar for the cases with different BCL2
  genotypes. However, the normal cell apoptotic fractions were higher for the tumors
  with t 14 18 compared to the tumors without BCL2 alterations, while the tumors with
  gain of BCL2 only showed intermediate levels. Low-level gains of parts of chromosome
  18 were found in 14 of the 38 B-NHL cases with t 14 18 , with a consensus region
  18pter-q21.33 that did not include the BCL2 gene. The 11 cases with 18q gain only
  showed a consensus region encompassing 18q21.2-18q21.32 and 18q21.33, which contain
  PMAIP1 MALT1 and BCL2, respectively.
