abstract: The human cell cycle transcription factor FOXM1 is known to play a key role
  in regulating timely mitotic progression and accurate chromosomal segregation during
  cell division. Deregulation of FOXM1 has been linked to a majority of human cancers.
  We previously showed that FOXM1 was upregulated in basal cell carcinoma and recently
  reported that upregulation of FOXM1 precedes malignancy in a number of solid human
  cancer types including oral, oesophagus, lung, breast, kidney, bladder and uterus.
  This indicates that upregulation of FOXM1 may be an early molecular signal required
  for aberrant cell cycle and cancer initiation.
