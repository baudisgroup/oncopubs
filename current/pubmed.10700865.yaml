abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect chromosomal imbalances
  in tumor DNA from two relapsed samples obtained in stages II and IV of a T-cell
  non-Hodgkin lymphoma in order to identify genetic mechanisms involved in tumor progression
  of this neoplasm. With conventional cytogenetic techniques CCT , a complex hyperdiploid
  karyotype was obtained in stage IV. Using CGH analysis, a normal profile was observed
  in stage II, whereas gains of 6p11.2, 7q11.2, 7q21-- amp gt q32, 7q34, 10p13, Xp11.4,
  and loss of 4q33-- amp gt qter chromosomal regions were detected in stage IV.
