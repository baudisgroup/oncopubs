abstract: Recent genome-wide microarray-based research investigations have revealed
  a high frequency of submicroscopic copy number alterations CNAs in the myelodysplastic
  syndromes MDS , suggesting microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH
  has the potential to detect new clinically relevant genomic markers in a diagnostic
  laboratory.
