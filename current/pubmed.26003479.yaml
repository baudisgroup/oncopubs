abstract: Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of non-small cell
  lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have different clinical presentations, morphologies, treatments,
  and prognoses. Recent studies suggested that fundamental genetic alterations related
  to carcinogenesis of each tumor type may be different. In this study, we investigated
  the genomic alterations of 47 primary NSCLC samples (22 ACs and 25 SCCs) as well
  as the corresponding normal tissue using array comparative genomic hybridization.
  Frequent copy number alterations (CNAs) which were identified in more than 68% of
  all of the cases were evaluated in each subtype (SCC and AC), and a CNA signature
  was established. Among these CNAs, 37 genes from the SCCs and 15 genes from the
  ACs were located in a region of gain, and 4 genes from the SCCs and 13 genes from
  the ACs were located in a region of loss. The most frequent gain was located on
  3q26-29 including the gene TP63 in SCCs and 7q11.23 and 7q36.3 in ACs. Moreover,
  we identified 3 genetically distinct groups (group I [16 SCC] with CNA signature
  of SCC; group II [7 SCC + 8 AC], which has genetically distinctive CNA signature
  from SCC and AC; and group III [2 SCC + 14 AC] with CNA signature of AC) by gene
  clustering extracted from CNAs, which are associated with a prognosis. The present
  study contributed to the molecular characterization of AC and SCC of NSCLC which
  showed a subtype of tumor that has a unique genetic CNA signature. However, further
  study about the significance of these 3 distinct groups and their usefulness as
  a diagnostic marker of identified CNAs is necessary.  Copyright ï¿½ 2015. Published
