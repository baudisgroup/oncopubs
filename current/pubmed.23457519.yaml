abstract: We designed a study to investigate genetic relationships between primary
  tumors of oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC and their lymph node metastases, and
  to identify genomic copy number aberrations CNAs related to lymph node metastasis.
  For this purpose, we collected a total of 42 tumor samples from 25 patients and
  analyzed their genomic profiles by array-based comparative genomic hybridization.
  We then compared the genetic profiles of metastatic primary tumors MPTs with their
  paired lymph node metastases LNMs , and also those of LNMs with non-metastatic primary
  tumors NMPTs . Firstly, we found that although there were some distinctive differences
  in the patterns of genomic profiles between MPTs and their paired LNMs, the paired
  samples shared similar genomic aberration patterns in each case. Unsupervised hierarchical
  clustering analysis grouped together 12 of the 15 MPT-LNM pairs. Furthermore, similarity
  scores between paired samples were significantly higher than those between non-paired
  samples. These results suggested that MPTs and their paired LNMs are composed predominantly
  of genetically clonal tumor cells, while minor populations with different CNAs may
  also exist in metastatic OSCCs. Secondly, to identify CNAs related to lymph node
  metastasis, we compared CNAs between grouped samples of MPTs and LNMs, but were
  unable to find any CNAs that were more common in LNMs. Finally, we hypothesized
  that subpopulations carrying metastasis-related CNAs might be present in both the
  MPT and LNM. Accordingly, we compared CNAs between NMPTs and LNMs, and found that
  gains of 7p, 8q and 17q were more common in the latter than in the former, suggesting
  that these CNAs may be involved in lymph node metastasis of OSCC. In conclusion,
  our data suggest that in OSCCs showing metastasis, the primary and metastatic tumors
  share similar genomic profiles, and that cells in the primary tumor may tend to
  metastasize after acquiring metastasis-associated CNAs.
