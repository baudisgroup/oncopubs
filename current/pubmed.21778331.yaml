abstract: It has been reported that large genomic deletions in the MLH1 and MSH2 genes
  are a frequent cause of Lynch syndrome in certain populations. Here, a cohort has
  been screened and two new founder rearrangements have been found in the MSH2 gene.
  These mutations have been characterized by break point determination, haplotype
  analysis, and genotype-phenotype correlation. Mutations have been identified in
  the MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes in 303 subjects from 160 suspected Lynch syndrome
  unrelated families. All subjects were tested using heteroduplex analysis by capillary
  array electrophoresis. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used
  to detect rearrangements in mutation-negative index patients and confirmed by reverse
  transcriptase PCR. The break point of the deletions was further characterized by
  the array comparative genomic hybridization method. Immunohistochemical staining
  and microsatellite instability were studied in tumor samples. Hereditary nonpolyposis
  colorectal cancer-related phenotypes were evaluated. More than 16 24 of 160 of the
  families had pathogenic mutations 8 MLH1, 15 MSH2, and 1 MSH6 . Twelve of these
  families 50 are carriers of a novel mutation. Seven of the 15 positive MSH2 families
  47 are carriers of a rearrangement. The exon 7 deletion and exon 4 to 8 deletion
  of MSH2 are new founder mutations. The segregation of a common haplotype, a similar
  phenotype, and anticipation effects were observed in these families. These findings
  will greatly simplify the diagnosis, counseling, and clinical care in suspected
  Lynch syndrome families and not just in specific geographic areas, so wide distribution
  may be explained by migration patterns.
