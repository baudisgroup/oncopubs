abstract: Heredity represents the strongest risk factor for ovarian cancer with disease
  predisposing mutations identified in 15% of the tumors. With the aim to identify
  genetic classifiers for hereditary ovarian cancer, we profiled hereditary ovarian
  cancers linked to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and the
  hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. Genome-wide array comparative
  genomic hybridization was applied to 12 HBOC associated tumors with BRCA1 mutations
  and 8 HNPCC associated tumors with mismatch repair gene mutations with 24 sporadic
  ovarian cancers as a control group. Unsupervised cluster analysis identified two
  distinct subgroups related to genetic complexity. Sporadic and HBOC associated tumors
  had complex genetic profiles with an average 41% of the genome altered, whereas
  the mismatch repair defective tumors had stable genetic profiles, with an average
  18% of the genome altered. Losses of 4q34, 13q12-q32 and 19p13 were overrepresented
  in the HBOC subset. Discriminating genes within these regions include BRCA2, FOXO1A
  and RB1. Gains on chromosomes 17 and 19 characterized the HNPCC tumors, but target
  genes herein are unknown. The results indicate that HBOC and HNPCC associated ovarian
  cancer develop along distinct genetic pathways and genetic profiles can thus be
  applied to distinguish between different types of hereditary ovarian cancer.
