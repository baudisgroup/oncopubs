abstract: 'Recently, initial studies describing the use of multicolor fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH for classifying melanocytic skin lesions have been published
  demonstrating a high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating melanomas from
  nevi. However, the majority of these studies included neither histologically ambiguous
  lesions nor a clinical long-term follow up. This study was undertaken to validate
  a special multicolor FISH test in histologically ambiguous melanocytic skin lesions
  with known clinical long-term follow up. FISH was scored by three independent pathologists
  in a series of 22 melanocytic skin lesions, including 12 ambiguous cases using four
  probes targeting chromosome 6p25, centromere 6, 6q23, and 11q13. The FISH results
  were compared with array comparative genomic hybridization data and correlated to
  the clinical long-term follow up mean: 65 months . Pair-wise comparison between
  the interpretations of the observers showed a moderate to substantial agreement
  kappa 0.47-0.61 . Comparing the FISH results with the clinical behavior reached
  an overall sensitivity of 60 and a specificity of 50 chi 2 0.25 P 0.61 for later
  development of metastases. Comparison of array comparative genomic hybridization
  data with FISH analyses did not yield significant results but array comparative
  genomic hybridization data demonstrated that melanocytic skin lesions with the development
  of metastases showed significantly more chromosomal aberrations P amp lt 0.01 compared
  with melanocytic skin lesions without the development of metastases. The FISH technique
  with its present composition of locus-specific probes for RREB1 MYB and CCND1 did
  not achieve a clinically useful sensitivity and specificity. However, a reassessment
  of the probes and better standardization of the method may lead to a valuable diagnostic
  tool.'
