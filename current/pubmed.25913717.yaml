abstract: "Whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) are two main
  platforms used for next-generation sequencing (NGS). While WES is primarily for
  DNA variant discovery and RNA-Seq is mainly for measurement of gene expression,
  both can be used for detection of genetic variants, especially single nucleotide
  variants (SNVs). How consistently variants can be detected from WES and RNA-Seq
  has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we examined the technical
  and biological inconsistencies in SNV detection using WES and RNA-Seq data from
  27 pairs of tumor and matched normal samples. We analyzed SNVs in three categories:
  WES unique - those only detected in WES, RNA-Seq unique - those only detected in
  RNA-Seq, and shared - those detected in both. We found a small overlap (average
  â\x88¼14%) between the SNVs called in WES and RNA-Seq. The WES unique SNVs were
  mainly due to low coverage, low expression, or their location on the non-transcribed
  strand in RNA-Seq data, while the RNA-Seq unique SNVs were primarily due to their
  location out of the WES-capture boundary regions (accounting â\x88¼71%), as well
  as low coverage of the regions, low coverage of the mutant alleles or RNA-editing.
  The shared SNVs had high locus-specific coverage in both WES and RNA-Seq and high
  gene expression levels. Additionally, WES unique and RNA-Seq unique SNVs showed
  different nucleotide substitution patterns, e.g., â\x88¼55% of RNA-Seq unique variants
  were A:Tâ\x86\x92G:C, a hallmark of RNA editing. This study provides an important
  evaluation on the inconsistencies of somatic SNVs called in WES and RNA-Seq data.
