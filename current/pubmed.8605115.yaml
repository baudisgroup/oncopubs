abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH allows detection of chromosomal imbalances
  in whole genomes in a comprehensive manner. With this approach, ten cases of prostate
  cancer seven primary tumors and three metastases were analyzed. Frequent chromosomal
  gains detected by CGH involved chromosome arms 7q, 8q, 9q, and 16p, and chromosomes
  20 and 22, as well as frequent losses of chromosome arms 16q and 18q, in at least
  three of the ten cases. Overrepresentation of chromosome arm 9q has not been described
  in published reports. The CGH data were compared with results of a loss of heterozygosity
  LOH study, in which complete allelotyping was performed in the same prostate tumors
  with 74 different polymorphic markers. In general, a high concordance between the
  CGH and LOH results was observed 92 . Tumors revealing discrepancies by CGH and
  LOH analysis were investigated further by interphase cytogenetics, and the resulting
  picture regarding the genomic alterations is discussed in detail.
