abstract: Increased production of Th2 cytokines characterizes Sezary syndrome, the
  leukemic form of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). To identify the molecular background
  and to study whether shared by the most common CTCL subtype, mycosis fungoides,
  we analyzed the gene expression profiles in both subtypes.  Freshly isolated cells
  from 30 samples, representing skin, blood, and enriched CD4(+) cell populations
  of mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, were analyzed with Affymetrix (Santa Clara,
  CA) oligonucleotide microarrays, quantitative PCR, or immunohistochemistry. The
  gene expression profiles were combined with findings of comparative genomic hybridization
  of the same samples to identify chromosomal changes affecting the aberrant gene
  expression.  We identified a set of Th1-specific genes [e.g., TBX21 (T-bet), NKG7,
  and SCYA5 (RANTES)] to be down-regulated in Sezary syndrome as well as in a proportion
  of mycosis fungoides samples. In both Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides blood
  samples, the S100P and LIR9 gene expression was up-regulated. In lesional skin,
  IL7R and CD52 were up-regulated. Integration of comparative genomic hybridization
  and transcriptomic data identified chromosome arms 1q, 3p, 3q, 4q, 12q, 16p, and
  16q as likely targets for new CTCL-associated gene aberrations.  Our findings revealed
  several new genes involved in CTCL pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.
  Down-regulation of a set of genes involved in Th1 polarization, including the major
  Th1-polarizing factor, TBX21, was for the first time associated with CTCL. In addition,
  a plausible explanation for the proliferative response of CTCL cells to locally
  produced interleukin-7 was revealed.
