abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an indolent salivary gland malignancy,
  characterized by t(6;9) translocations and MYB-NFIB gene fusions in approximately
  50% of the tumors. The genetic alterations underlying t(6;9)-negative and t(6;9)-positive/MYB-NFIB
  fusion-negative ACC remain unknown. To uncover the genetic alterations in ACC lacking
  the canonical translocation and fusion transcript and identify new abnormalities
  in translocation positive tumors.We performed whole-genome sequencing in 21 salivary
  ACCs and conducted targeted molecular analyses in a validation set (81 patients).
  Microarray gene-expression data were also analyzed to explore the biologic differences
  between fusion positive and negative tumors.We identified a novel MYBL1-NFIB gene
  fusion as a result of t(8;9) translocation and multiple rearrangements in the MYBL1
  gene in 35% of the t(6;9)-negative ACCs. All MYBL1 alterations involved deletion
  of the C-terminal negative regulatory domain and were associated with high MYBL1
  expression. Reciprocal MYB and MYBL1 expression was consistently found in ACCs.
  In addition, 5'-NFIB fusions that did not involve MYB/MYBL1 genes were identified
  in a subset of t(6;9)-positive/fusion-negative tumors. We also delineated distinct
  gene-expression profiles in ACCs associated with the length of the MYB or MYBL1
  fusions, suggesting a biologic importance of the C-terminal part of these fusions.Our
  study defines new molecular subclasses of ACC characterized by MYBL1 rearrangements
  and 5'-NFIB gene fusions.
