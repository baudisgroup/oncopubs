abstract: The HER2 gene is an important prognostic and therapeutic marker in newly
  diagnosed breast cancer. Currently, HER2 status is most frequently determined by
  immunohistochemical detection of HER2 protein expression on the cellular membrane
  surface or by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of HER2 gene copy number
  in fixed tissue using locus-specific probes for the HER2 gene and chromosome 17
  centromere. However, these methods are problematic because of issues with intra-
  and inter-laboratory reproducibility and preanalytic variables, such as fixation
  time. In addition, the commonly used HER2 chromosome 17 ratio presumes that chromosome
  17 polysomy is present when the centromere is amplified, even though analysis of
  the rest of the chromosome is not included in the assay. In this study, 97 frozen
  samples of invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma, with known immunohistochemistry
  and fluorescence in situ hybridization results for HER2, were analyzed by comparative
  genomic hybridization to a commercially available bacterial artificial chromosome
  whole-genome array containing 99 probes targeted to chromosome 17 and the HER2 TOP2
  amplicon. Results were 97 concordant for HER2 status, meeting the College of American
  Pathologists American Society of Clinical Oncologys validation requirements for
  HER2 testing. Surprisingly, not a single case of complete polysomy 17 was detected
  even though multiple breast cancer cases showed clear polysomies of other chromosomes.
  We conclude that array comparative genomic hybridization is an accurate and objective
  DNA-based alternative for clinical evaluation of HER2 gene copy number, and that
  polysomy 17 is a rare event in breast cancer.
