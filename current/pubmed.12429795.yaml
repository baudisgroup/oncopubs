abstract: 'The current classification system of renal tumors is based on morphologic
  criteria, as supported by genetic findings. We present a group of previously unclassified
  tumors with similar morphologic and genetic features, suggesting a new entity within
  renal neoplasms. Seven renal tumors from five patients ages 31-67 years were analyzed.
  All cases were stained with periodic acid-Schiff, Hales colloidal iron HCI , and
  Alcian blue AB at pH 2.5 1.0 with and without hyaluronidase HA digestion. Immunohistochemical
  IHC stains were performed for CK8, CK18, CK19, vimentin, villin, Tamm-Horsfall protein
  THP , renal cell carcinoma marker RCC , epithelial membrane antigen EMA , ulex europaeus
  agglutinin UEA-1 , soy bean agglutinin SBA , peanut agglutinin PNA , and MIB-1.
  Comparative genomic hybridization CGH and loss of heterozygosity LOH studies were
  performed on all cases. All tumors showed circumscribed growth, a tubular growth
  pattern with focal solid areas, no significant nuclear atypia and absence of necrosis,
  desmoplasia, or inflammation. Abundant extracellular mucin was present. Immunohistochemistry
  stains support collecting duct origin EMA , PNA , SBA -, CK 8 18 19 , vimentin -,
  UEA-1-, RCC-, villin-, THP- . The proliferative rate was low amp lt 1 . CGH showed
  multiple consistent chromosomal losses -1,-4, -6, -8, -9, -13, -14, -15, -22 . Clinical
  outcome was favorable, with recurrences but no known distant metastases or death
  of disease. These findings are distinct from all previously classified renal neoplasms.
  Our data suggest the presence of a unique tumor entity within tumors of probable
  collecting duct origin: tubular-mucinous renal tumors of low malignant potential.'
