abstract: Amplified MYCN, common in neuroblastomas, can be detected as double minutes
  dmin or homogenously staining chromosomal regions hsr . Expulsion of amplified MYCN
  has only been described in dmin. We used hydroxyurea HU , which accelerates the
  expulsion of amplified genes and cytostatics used in neuroblastoma therapy , to
  describe MYCN amplification changes after chemotherapy. We used IMR-32, SK-N-AS,
  UKF-NB-2, UKF-NB-3, UKF-NB-4, and derived sublines resistant to doxorubicin, cisplatin,
  and vincristine. The loss of amplified MYCN copies was investigated using comparative
  genomic hybridization and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. We found expulsion
  of amplified MYCN from hsr in UKF-NB-4 and IMR-32 cell lines, and determined the
  exact number of amplified MYCN copies. After the first cultivation with HU, some
  amplified MYCN was lost. UKF-NB-4 lost 20 copies on average, and IMR-32 lost 15
  copies P amp lt 0.001 . After the second cultivation, cells without MYCN amplification
  were found. In comparison to sensitive cell lines, drug-resistant cell lines lost
  17 copies on average. Our data show that expulsion of amplified MYCN genes is also
  possible from hsr and may be induced, not only by HU, but by other cytostatics as
  well.
