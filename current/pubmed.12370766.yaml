abstract: 'New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve survival in glioblastoma
  GBM the most malignant astrocytic tumor. We evaluated: a the genetic status of 22
  GBMs by comparative genomic hybridization CGH b the specific role of mutation and
  or homozygous deletion of PTEN in the genesis of GBM and c the possible therapeutic
  role of PTEN against GBM, in vitro. CGH demonstrated that the most frequent region
  of gain was at chromosome 7p, whereas the most frequent losses occurred at chromosomes
  10q and 13q. Losses at chromosome 10 were found in 36 of patients, and PTEN was
  mutated in 27 of the 22 GBMs, including 4 point mutations and 2 homozygous deletions.
  The possible therapeutic role of PTEN in GBM was also studied in a system based
  on retroviral infection of the GBM cell line A172, homozygously deleted at the PTEN
  locus. A172 growth and proliferation rate were reduced by 50 after PTEN transduction.
  Moreover, we showed that inhibition of cell growth occurred through the PI3K Akt
  p27 pathway. Our findings suggest that PTEN participates in the genesis of GBM,
  and might be further studied as a candidate therapeutic agent in other testing systems.'
