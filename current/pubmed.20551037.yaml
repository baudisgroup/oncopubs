abstract: Deregulation of key cellular pathways is fundamental for the survival and
  expansion of neoplastic cells. In cancer, regulation of gene transcription can be
  mediated in a variety of ways. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact
  of gene dosage on gene expression patterns and the effect of other mechanisms on
  transcriptional levels, and to associate these genomic changes with clinicopathologic
  parameters.
