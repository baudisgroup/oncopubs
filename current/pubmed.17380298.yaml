abstract: The aim of this study is to find any specific genetic defect occurring frequently
  in bilateral breast cancer by examining the genetic changes of each chromosome using
  comparative genomic hybridisation CGH . CGH was conducted for 36 breast cancer tissues
  taken from patients treated with surgery for bilateral breast cancer. Tumour and
  control DNAs were hybridised to metaphase chromosome with differential staining
  with fluorescein and rhodamine-dUTP. An average rate of green DNA of tumour cell
  against red DNA of a normal peripheral blood lymphocyte was calculated in these
  captured metaphase chromosomes and a ratio of more than 1.17 was defined as an acquisition,
  less than 0.85 as a loss and, finally, more than 2 as amplification. Twenty-six
  out of 36 cases 72.2 showed a change in the number of DNA copies by CGH in one or
  more regions of gene. On average, 5.3 alterations for each chromosome range, 1-14
  were found, and gain was present more than loss at a ratio of 1.3:1. Loci that showed
  amplification were X, 17q, Xq, 8q, 14q11-21 and 17q22-qter. The locus showing the
  most gain was the X chromosome, which was observed in 15 57.7 out of 26 cases. Loss
  was most frequently observed in the short arm of chromosome 8. The concordance of
  genetic transformation of primary cancer and secondary cancer in bilateral breast
  cancer was an average of 18.7 in synchronous and 10.7 in metachronous cancer, showing
  higher similarity in synchronous breast cancer.
