abstract: Twenty-five primary retinoblastoma tumours were analysed by real-time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction to determine the genomic copy number of the N-MYC gene
  2p24 relative to the copy number for REL, B2M, ALB, AF10 and MLL. Twenty-one of
  these tumours were shown by Comparative Genomic Hybridization to contain variable
  copy number increases of chromosomal material mapping to 2p. High level amplification
  amp gt 30-fold of N-MYC was found in three tumours, none of which showed adverse
  histological features and all patients are surviving at between 54 and 108 months
  post enucleation. Furthermore, the three tumours associated with metastasis and
  adverse patient outcome showed normal N-MYC copy number. Although high level amplification
  of N-MYC is an unfavourable prognostic indicator in neuroblastoma, these data show
  no evidence of a correlation between amplification of N-MYC and adverse outcome
  in retinoblastoma.
