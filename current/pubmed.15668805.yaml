abstract: Primary acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma ASCC of the breast is a rare
  and aggressive variant of invasive breast cancer. Here we report two new cases of
  ASCC and their immunohistochemical and cytogenetic characterization. One case was
  associated with systemic metastases and death and the other with local failure prior
  to loss of follow-up. Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , both tumors
  showed a high overall number of chromosomal imbalances with a similar pattern of
  gains and losses. Genetic aberrations common to both tumors included losses at 3p11-p25,
  5q21-q31, 8p, 9, 13p13-q21, 16q12-q21, and 17p and gains at 1q31-qter, 7p, 18q12-qter,
  19q, and 20. Immunohistochemically, the tumors were characterized by high proliferative
  activity, an uncommon cytokeratin expression profile, reduced E-cadherin staining,
  and overexpression of p53 and epithelial growth factor receptor EGFR . The results
  of our analyses suggest that genetic alterations observed in ASCC of the breast
  include imbalances commonly observed in both mammary adenocarcinoma and squamous
  cell carcinoma of other locations. Furthermore, the overexpressed EGFR could be
  a possible therapeutic target for individual cases of this aggressive tumor type.
