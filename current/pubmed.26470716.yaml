abstract: High-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) has been implicated in a subset
  of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). We therefore hypothesised that
  HPV associated OAC may have distinct genomic aberrations compared with viral negative
  oesophageal cancer.  Whole exome sequencing was performed to explore the mutational
  landscape and potential molecular signature of HPV-positive versus HPV-negative
  OAC. Four hr-HPV-positive and 8 HPV-negative treatment-naive fresh-frozen OAC tissue
  specimens and matched normal tissue were analysed to identify somatic genomic mutations.
  Data were subjected to cancer driver gene identification and pathway analysis.  The
  HPV-positive cohort harboured approximately 50% less non-silent somatic mutations
  than the virus-negative patients with oesophageal cancer (1.31 mutations/Mb vs 2.56
  mutations/Mb, p=0.048). TP53 aberrations were absent in the HPV-positive OAC group
  whereas 50% of the HPV-negative patients with OAC exhibited TP53 mutations. HPV-negative
  cancers were enriched with non-silent mutations in cancer driver genes, but not
  HPV-positive tumours. Enriched A>C transversions at adenine-adenine (AA) dinucleotide
  was observed in 5/7 Siewert class I OAC samples but none (0/5) in Siewert class
  II tumours (p=0.027).  These findings demonstrate distinct genomic differences between
  HPV-positive and HPV-negative OACs indicating different biological mechanisms of
  tumour formation.  Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited. For permission
