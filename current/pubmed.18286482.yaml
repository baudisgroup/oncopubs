abstract: BUB1B and RASSF1A genes play specific roles in the mitotic checkpoint, and
  their defects may cause chromosome instability or aneuploidy in mouse fibroblasts
  and human cancer cell lines however, few studies have reported a correlation between
  defects in these genes and chromosome changes in human tumor samples. We examined
  chromosome abnormalities in 25 Wilms tumors by metaphase comparative genomic hybridization,
  and classified them into 14 hyperdiploid 50 amp gt or chromosomes , 2 near-or-pseudodiploid,
  and 9 diploid tumors. We also examined various molecular aspects of BUB1B and RASSF1A,
  and evaluated the relationship between chromosome changes and the status of both
  genes. No tumors showed BUB1B mutation. BubR1 protein BUB1B gene product expression
  was undetectable or decreased in five of six hyperdiploid or near-or-pseudodiploid
  tumors and increased in four of five diploid tumors, whereas all seven tumors examined
  showed BUB1B mRNA expression irrespective of their chromosome pattern. Furthermore,
  while complete promoter methylation of RASSF1A was found in 13 of 16 hyperdiploid
  or near-or-pseudodiploid tumors, unmethylated RASSF1A was found in 5 of 9 diploid
  tumors. Partial RASSF1A methylation was found in three hyperdiploid or near-or-pseudodiploid
  tumors and in four diploid tumors. Thus, BubR1 protein expression decreased, and
  the promoter region of RASSF1A was completely methylated in the great majority of
  hyperdiploid or near-or-pseudodiploid tumors, BubR1 protein expression increased
  and RASSF1A was unmethylated in the majority of diploid tumors. These findings suggest
  that the combined BubR1 protein down-regulation and RASSF1A hypermethylation might
  be implicated in the formation of chromosomal changes found in Wilms tumors.
