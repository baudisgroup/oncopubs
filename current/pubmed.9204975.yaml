abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to detect changes in DNA
  copy number in 25 cases of refractory acute myeloid leukemia AML . CGH detected
  changes in DNA copy number in nine AML 36 . Losses 82 were more frequent than gains
  18 . No high-level amplifications were detected in any of the cases. Losses involved
  minimal overlapping regions at 5q14q32, 7q31.2q32 and 12p12. The most frequent gain
  was detected at 8q. CGH gave normal results in all cases with a normal karyotype
  or a translocation as the sole aberration. The absence of high-level DNA copy gains
  suggests that, in contrast to other malignancies, gene amplification is not an important
  mechanism for drug resistance in AML. In addition to 5q and 7q, known to be associated
  with disease refractoriness, 12p may be another region related to poor prognosis.
