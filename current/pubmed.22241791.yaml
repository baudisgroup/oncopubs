  cancers are heterogeneous not only in terms of clinical outcome but also at the
  molecular level. Our aim was to establish a novel risk classification system based
  on a gene expression signature for predicting overall survival, leading to suggesting
  novel therapeutic strategies for high-risk patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this
  large-scale cross-platform study of six microarray data sets consisting of 1,054
  ovarian cancer patients, we developed a gene expression signature for predicting
  overall survival by applying elastic net and 10-fold cross-validation to a Japanese
  data set A n 260 and evaluated the signature in five other data sets. Subsequently,
  we investigated differences in the biological characteristics between high- and
  low-risk ovarian cancer groups. RESULTS: An elastic net analysis identified a 126-gene
  expression signature for predicting overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer
  using the Japanese data set A multivariate analysis, P 4 x 10 -20 . We validated
  its predictive ability with five other data sets using multivariate analysis Tothill
  s data set, P 1 x 10 -5 Bonome s data set, P 0.0033 Dressman s data set, P 0.0016
  TCGA data set, P 0.0027 Japanese data set B, P 0.021 . Through gene ontology and
  pathway analyses, we identified a significant reduction in expression of immune-response-related
  genes, especially on the antigen presentation pathway, in high-risk ovarian cancer
  patients. CONCLUSIONS: This risk classification based on the 126-gene expression
  signature is an accurate predictor of clinical outcome in patients with advanced
  stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer and has the potential to develop new therapeutic
  strategies for high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.'
