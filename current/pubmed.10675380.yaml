abstract: Ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS recurs in the same breast following breast-conserving
  surgery in 5 -25 of patients, with the rate influenced by the presence or absence
  of involved surgical margins, tumor size and nuclear grade, and whether or not radiation
  therapy was performed. A recurrent lesion arising soon after excision of an initial
  DCIS may reflect residual disease, whereas in situ tumors arising after longer periods
  are sometimes considered to be second independent events. The purpose of this study
  was to determine the clonal relationship between initial DCIS lesions and their
  recurrences.
