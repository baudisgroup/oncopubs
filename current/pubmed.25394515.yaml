abstract: Response to drug therapy in individual colorectal cancer (CRC) patients
  is associated with tumour biology. Here we describe the genomic landscape of tumour
  samples of a homogeneous well-annotated series of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC)
  of two phase III clinical trials, CAIRO and CAIRO2. DNA copy number aberrations
  of 349 patients are determined. Within three treatment arms, 194 chromosomal subregions
  are associated with progression-free survival (PFS; uncorrected single-test P-values
  <0.005). These subregions are filtered for effect on messenger RNA expression, using
  an independent data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas which returned 171 genes. Three
  chromosomal regions are associated with a significant difference in PFS between
  treatment arms with or without irinotecan. One of these regions, 6q16.1-q21, correlates
  in vitro with sensitivity to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. This genomic
  landscape of mCRC reveals a number of DNA copy number aberrations associated with
  response to drug therapy.
