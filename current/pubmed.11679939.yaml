abstract: Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma LCNEC and small-cell lung cancer SCLC
  are high-grade neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. Despite different morphologic
  appearances, loss of heterozygosity and oncogene studies on LCNEC to date suggest
  genetic similarities. We analyzed 13 LCNEC and 5 mixed SCLC LCNEC tumors by comparative
  genomic hybridization and subsequently compared our results with previously published
  data on 32 SCLCs. Comparison with SCLC showed several shared chromosomal aberrations,
  specifically losses of 3p, 4q, 5q, and 13q and gains of 5p. However, these aberrations
  are no special feature of neuroendocrine lung tumors but can also be found in other
  high-grade lung carcinomas. From this point of view, genetic similarities of LCNEC
  and SCLC are less important than the nonrandom changes that differ between these
  2 tumor types. A gain of 3q observed in 66 of all SCLCs was detected only once in
  the LCNEC group. In contrast to the pure LCNEC, all mixed types with a SCLC component
  had a gain of 3q. Gains of 6p occurred more frequently in LCNEC. Deletions of 10q,
  16q, and 17p were less frequent in LCNEC than in SCLC.
