abstract: Germ Cell Tumors GCTs in children and adolescents constitute a clinically
  and histologically heterogeneous group of tumors. Compared to GCTs in adults, the
  numbers of GCTs in children analyzed with cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques
  is limited. However, the data available to date reveal a pattern of cytogenetic
  aberrations different from that in adults. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  is a valuable technique for the genetic profiling of tumors that allows screening
  for chromosomal imbalances consistent with amplification of oncogenes and loss of
  putative tumor suppressor genes. As CGH does not require tissue culture, it also
  allows analysing archival tissue samples.
