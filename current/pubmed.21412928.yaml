abstract: Pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma occurs as two biologically distinct histological
  variants, embryonal ERMS and alveolar ARMS . To identify genomic changes that drive
  ERMS pathogenesis, we used a new array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH platform
  to examine a specific subset of ERMS tumors, those occurring in children with clinically
  defined intermediate-risk disease. The aCGH platform used has an average probe spacing
  approximately 1 kb, and can identify genomic changes with single gene resolution.
  Our data suggest that these tumors share a common genomic program that includes
  inactivation of a master regulator of the p53 and Rb pathways, CDKN2A B, and activation
  of FGFR4, Ras, and Hedgehog Hh signaling. The CDKN2A B tumor suppressor is deleted
  in most patient samples. FGFR4, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, is activated
  in 20 of tumors, predominantly by amplification of mutant, activating FGFR4 alleles.
  Over 50 of patients had low-level gains of a region containing the Hh-pathway transcription
  factor GLI1, and a gene expression pattern consistent with Hh-pathway activation.
  We also identified intragenic deletions affecting NF1, a tumor suppressor and inhibitor
  of Ras, in 15 of tumor samples. Deletion of NF1 and the presence of activating Ras
  mutations in 42 of patients were mutually exclusive, suggesting NF1 loss is an alternative
  and potentially common mechanism of Ras activation in ERMS. Our data suggest that
  intermediate-risk ERMS is driven by a common set of genomic defects, a finding that
  has important implications for the application of targeted therapies to improve
  the treatment of children diagnosed with this disease.
