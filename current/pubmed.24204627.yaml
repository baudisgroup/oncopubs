abstract: 'PURPOSE:New anticancer agents that target a single cell surface receptor,
  up-regulated or amplified gene product, or mutated gene, have met with some success
  in treating advanced cancers. However, patients apos tumors still eventually progress
  on these therapies. If it were possible to identify a larger number of targetable
  vulnerabilities in an individual apos s tumor, multiple targets could be exploited
  with the use of specific therapeutic agents, thus possibly giving the patient viable
  therapeutic alternatives.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:In this exploratory study, we used
  next-generation sequencing technologies NGS including whole genome sequencing WGS
  , and where feasible, whole transcriptome sequencing WTS to identify genomic events
  and associated expression changes in advanced cancer patients.RESULTS:WGS on paired
  tumor and normal samples from nine advanced cancer patients and WTS on six of these
  patients apos tumors was completed. One patient apos s treatment was based on targets
  and pathways identified by NGS and the patient had a short-lived PET CT response
  with a significant reduction in his tumor-related pain. To design treatment plans
  based on information garnered from NGS, several challenges were encountered: NGS
  reporting delays, communication of results to out-of-state participants and their
  treating oncologists, and chain of custody handling for fresh biopsy samples for
  Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments CLIA target validation.CONCLUSION:While
  the initial effort was a slower process than anticipated due to a variety of issues,
  we demonstrate the feasibility of using NGS in advanced cancer patients so that
  treatments for patients with progressing tumors may be improved.'
