abstract: DNA copy number changes were studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH on bone marrow samples obtained from 72 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia ALL at diagnosis. The patients had been admitted to the Helsinki University
  Central Hospital Finland between 1982 and 1997. CGH showed DNA copy number changes
  in 45 patients 62.5 with a mean of 4.6 aberrations per patient range, 1 to 22 .
  The results of CGH and chromosome banding analysis were generally concordant, but
  CGH facilitated specific karyotyping in 34 cases. DNA copy number gains were more
  frequent than losses gains:losses, 6:1 . Gains of DNA sequences affected almost
  exclusively whole chromosomes and were most commonly observed in chromosomes 21
  25 , 18 22.2 , X 19.4 , 10 19.4 and 17 19.4 . The most common partial gain was 1q31-q32
  8.3 . The most common gains of chromosomes 21, 18, X, 10, 17, 14, 4, 6 and 8 appeared
  concurrently. High-level amplifications of small chromosome regions were sporadic,
  detected only in two patients 2.8 . Chromosome 21 was involved in both cases. The
  most common losses were 9p22-pter 12.5 and 12p13-pter 11.1 . No statistically significant
  association between the CGH findings and the diagnostic white blood cell count was
  observed.
