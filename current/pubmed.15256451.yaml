abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization, with a genome-wide resolution of
  approximately 1 Mb, has been used to investigate copy number changes in 48 colorectal
  cancer CRC cell lines and 37 primary CRCs. The samples were divided for analysis
  according to the type of genomic instability that they exhibit, microsatellite instability
  MSI or chromosomal instability CIN . Consistent copy number changes were identified,
  including gain of chromosomes 20, 13, and 8q and smaller regions of amplification
  such as chromosome 17q11.2-q12. Loss of chromosome 18q was a recurrent finding along
  with deletion of discrete regions such as chromosome 4q34-q35. The overall pattern
  of copy number change was strikingly similar between cell lines and primary cancers
  with a few obvious exceptions such as loss of chromosome 6 and gain of chromosomes
  15 and 12p in the former. A greater number of aberrations were detected in CIN than
  MSI samples as well as differences in the type and extent of change reported. For
  example, loss of chromosome 8p was a common event in CIN cell lines and cancers
  but was often found to be gained in MSI cancers. In addition, the target of amplification
  on chromosome 8q appeared to differ, with 8q24.21 amplified frequently in CIN samples
  but 8q24.3 amplification a common finding in MSI samples. A number of genes of interest
  are located within the frequently aberrated regions, which are likely to be of importance
  in the development and progression of CRC.
