abstract: 'Glioblastoma Multiforme GBM is a malignant brain cancer that develops after
  accumulating genomic DNA damage that often includes gene amplifications and or deletions.
  These copy number changes can be a critical step in brain tumor development. To
  evaluate glioblastoma genomic copy number changes, we determined the genome-wide
  copy number alterations in 31 GBMs. Illumina Bead Arrays were used to assay 22 GBMs
  and Digital Karyotyping was used on 8 GBM cell lines and one primary sample. The
  common amplifications we observed for all 31 samples was GLI CDK4 22.6 , MDM2 12.9
  and PIK3C2B MDM4 12.9 . In the 22 GBM tumors, EGFR was amplified in 22.7 of surgical
  biopsies. The most common homozygously deleted region contained CDKN2A CDKN2B p15
  and p16 occurring in 29 of cases. This data was compiled and compared to published
  array CGH studies of 456 cases of GBMs. Pooling our Illumina data with published
  studies yielded these average amplification rates: EGFR-35.7 , GLI CDK4-13.4 , MDM2-9.2
  , PIK3C2B MDM4-7.7 , and PDGFRA-7.7 . The CDKN2A CDKN2B locus was deleted in 46.4
  of the combined cases. This study provides a larger assessment of amplifications
  and deletions in glioblastoma patient populations and shows that several different
  copy number technologies can produce similar results. The main pathways known to
  be involved in GBM tumor formation such as p53 control, growth signaling, and cell
  cycle control are all represented by amplifications or deletions of critical pathway
  genes. This information is potentially important for formulating targeted therapy
  in glioblastoma and for planning genomic studies.'
