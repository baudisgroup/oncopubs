abstract: 'Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among patients with gynecological
  cancers, but the biology of these tumors is still among the least understood of
  all major human malignancies. In this study, comparative genomic hybridization was
  used to determine chromosomal alterations in 98 stage III serous papillary adenocarcinomas.
  The tumors were grouped according to survival and the main prognostic factors stage
  and surgical outcome. There were chromosomal imbalances that were significantly
  more common in tumors from patients who died than in tumors from patients who survived:
  gains of 1q24-qter and losses of 4p, 4q31.1-qter, 5q12-q22, 8p, 16q, and X. Furthermore,
  we observed that gains of 8q23-8q24.2 and losses of 4p, 4q13-4q26, 4q31.1-qter,
  5q12-q22, 8p, and 16q were significantly more common in tumors from patients with
  macroscopic residual tumor after primary surgery, compared to tumors from those
  who had undergone radical surgery. Gains of 3q13.3-qter, 6p, 7q21-q31, and 11q13-q23
  and losses of 4q31.1-qter and 16q were more common in stage IIIc tumors than in
  stage IIIa b tumors. On the basis of our results, we suggest that there are biological
  differences among the groups mentioned above and that absence of chromosomal aberrations
  in specific regions predicts a good clinical outcome for individual patients.'
