abstract: 'There is evidence that specific genetic events are involved in the initiation
  and progression of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The genotype-phenotype
  correlations in cervical adenocarcinoma AC are unclear. Experimental Design: Comparative
  genomic hybridization was applied to screen for DNA copy number gains and losses
  in 22 cervical ACs of clinical stage IB. IHC was performed in all of the samples
  to determine HER-2 neu expression HercepTest .'
