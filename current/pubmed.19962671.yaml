abstract: We discovered a high-level amplicon involving the chr19q13.41 microRNA miRNA
  cluster C19MC in 11 45 approximately 25 primary CNS-PNET, which results in striking
  overexpression of miR-517c and 520g. Constitutive expression of miR-517c or 520g
  promotes in vitro and in vivo oncogenicity, modulates cell survival, and robustly
  enhances growth of untransformed human neural stem cells hNSCs in part by upregulating
  WNT pathway signaling and restricting differentiation of hNSCs. Remarkably, the
  C19MC amplicon, which is very rare in other brain tumors 1 263 , identifies an aggressive
  subgroup of CNS-PNET with distinct gene-expression profiles, characteristic histology,
  and dismal survival. Our data implicate miR-517c and 520g as oncogenes and promising
  biological markers for CNS-PNET and provide important insights into oncogenic properties
  of the C19MC locus.
