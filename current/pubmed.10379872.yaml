abstract: Neuroblastoma is one of the most common malignant tumors of childhood and
  is characterized by regressive and progressive disease. Genetic factors that define
  progression of neuroblastomas are still unknown. We performed comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH on 27 neuroblastomas and dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH to identify genetic aberrations associated with progressive neuroblastoma showing
  resistance to aggressive treatment. 17q21-q25 gains and MYCN amplification were
  associated with stage 4 neuroblastomas however, these genetic aberrations had no
  significant relation to the progression of stage 4 neuroblastomas. A novel chromosomal
  gain at 1q21-q25 was found in 8 of 16 cases 50 of stage 4 neuroblastoma. Gain of
  1q21-q25 was observed in all of the progressive cases 8 8 , which showed resistance
  to chemotherapy, including 5 fatal neuroblastomas in stage 4, whereas 1q21-q25 gain
  was not found in any of the 8 remission cases in stage 4. Survival analysis also
  showed that 1q21-q25 gain was associated with a poor outcome. High xenotransplantability
  in nude mice was observed for the tumors with 1q21-q25 gain 4 5 80 . These data
  show that 1q21-q25 gain is strongly associated with progression of stage 4 neuroblastoma.
  Furthermore, by dual-color FISH analysis using cosmid clones, the 1q21-q25 gain
  was narrowed to increase in DNA copy number on 1q23 in the fatal type of stage 4
  neuroblastoma showing this gain. These results suggest that DNA amplification at
  1q23 may play a role in the development of progressive neuroblastoma in an advanced
  stage.
