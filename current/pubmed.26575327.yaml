abstract: 'The prime focus of the current therapeutic strategy for Multiple Myeloma
  (MM) is to obtain an early and deep tumour burden reduction, up to the level of
  complete response (CR). To date, no description of the characteristics of the plasma
  cells (PC) prone to achieve CR has been reported. This study aimed at the molecular
  characterization of PC obtained at baseline from MM patients in CR after bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone
  (VTD) first line therapy.One hundred and eighteen MM primary tumours obtained from
  homogeneously treated patients were profiled both for gene expression and for single
  nucleotide polymorphism genotype. Genomic results were used to obtain a predictor
  of sensitivity to VTD induction therapy, as well as to describe both the transcription
  and the genomic profile of PC derived from MM with subsequent optimal response to
  primary induction therapy.By analysing the gene profiles of CR patients, we identified
  a 5-gene signature predicting CR with an overall median accuracy of 75% (range:
  72%-85%). In addition, we highlighted the differential expression of a series of
  genes, whose deregulation might explain patients'' sensitivity to VTD therapy. We
  also showed that a small copy number loss, covering 606Kb on chromosome 1p22.1 was
  the most significantly associated with CR patients.'
