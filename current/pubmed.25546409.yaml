abstract: Intratumoral heterogeneity may help drive resistance to targeted therapies
  in cancer. In breast cancer, the presence of nodal metastases is a key indicator
  of poorer overall survival. The aim of this study was to identify somatic genetic
  alterations in early dissemination of breast cancer by whole genome next generation
  sequencing (NGS) of a primary breast tumor, a matched locally-involved axillary
  lymph node and healthy normal DNA from blood.  Whole genome NGS was performed on
  12 ï¿½g (range 11.1-13.3 ï¿½g) of DNA isolated from fresh-frozen primary breast
  tumor, axillary lymph node and peripheral blood following the DNA nanoball sequencing
  protocol. Single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and substitutions were
  identified through a bioinformatic pipeline and compared to CIN25, a key set of
  genes associated with tumor metastasis.  Whole genome sequencing revealed overlapping
  variants between the tumor and node, but also variants that were unique to each.
  Novel mutations unique to the node included those found in two CIN25 targets, TGIF2
  and CCNB2, which are related to transcription cyclin activity and chromosomal stability,
  respectively, and a unique frameshift in PDS5B, which is required for accurate sister
  chromatid segregation during cell division. We also identified dominant clonal variants
  that progressed from tumor to node, including SNVs in TP53 and ARAP3, which mediates
  rearrangements to the cytoskeleton and cell shape, and an insertion in TOP2A, the
  expression of which is significantly associated with tumor proliferation and can
  segregate breast cancers by outcome.  This case study provides preliminary evidence
  that primary tumor and early nodal metastasis have largely overlapping somatic genetic
  alterations. There were very few mutations unique to the involved node. However,
  significant conclusions regarding early dissemination needs analysis of a larger
  number of patient samples.
