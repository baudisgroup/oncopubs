abstract: Two metachronous anaplastic oligoastrocytomas with different cerebral locations
  were analyzed in a 51-year-old patient with an extended recurrence-free interval
  of 6 years and an a long survival of 9 years. Remarkably, the patient had not undergone
  adjuvant chemotherapy. Different cytogenetic and molecular techniques were performed
  including comparative genomic hybridization CGH , fluorescence in situ hybridization
  FISH , allelic loss analysis, sequencing of p53, p16 INK4a CDKN2A and p14 ARF ,
  EGFRamplification studies, investigation of the DNA mismatch repair system as well
  as tumor clonality. Using CGH and FISH a profile of low accumulation of cytogenetic
  aberrations was found in the second tumor, with no significant increase in the percentage
  of hyperdiploid nuclei. Microsatellite analysis showed a common pattern of allelic
  losses at 1p36, 19q13 and 9p21. Both specimens were also similar in that they retained
  heterozygosity at 10q23-q24 and 13q14 and that they harbor neither EGFR amplification
  nor mutations of p53, p16 INK4a CDKN2A or p14 ARF . The only further alteration
  in the second tumor was an allelic loss at p53. The X-chromosome inactivation HUMARA
  analysis revealed a polyclonal pattern in both samples. Our data strongly suggest
  that the second anaplastic oligoastrocytoma developed as a distant relapse of the
  first tumor. Whether the paucity of accumulation of the observed genetic alterations
  might be associated with the unusually extended relapse-free time of the patient
  remains to be elucidated.
