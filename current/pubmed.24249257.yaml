abstract: Both hereditary and nonhereditary retinoblastoma Rb are commonly initiated
  by loss of both copies of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene RB1 , while additional
  genomic changes are required for tumor initiation and progression. Our aim was to
  determine whether there is genomic heterogeneity between different clinical Rb subtypes.
  Therefore, 21 Rb tumors from 11 hereditary patients and 10 nonhereditary Rb patients
  were analyzed using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism SNP arrays and
  gene losses and gains were validated with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification.
  In these tumors only a few focal aberrations were detected. The most frequent was
  a focal gain on chromosome 2p24.3, the minimal region of gain encompassing the oncogene
  MYCN. The genes BAZ1A, OTX2, FUT8, and AKT1 were detected in four focal regions
  on chromosome 14 in one nonhereditary Rb. There was a large difference in number
  of copy number aberrations between tumors. A subset of nonhereditary Rbs turned
  out to be the most genomic unstable, while especially very young patients with hereditary
  Rb display stable genomes. Established Rb copy number aberrations, including gain
  of chromosome arm 1q and loss of chromosome arm 16q, turned out to be preferentially
  associated with the nonhereditary Rbs with later age of diagnosis. In contrast,
  copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity was detected mainly on chromosome 13,
  where RB1 resides, irrespective of hereditary status or age. Focal amplifications
  and deletions and copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity besides chromosome
  13 appear to be rare events in retinoblastoma. 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
