abstract: 'Neuroblastic tumours are a group of paediatric cancers with marked morphological
  heterogeneity. Neuroblastoma Schwannian stroma-poor NB-SP is composed of undifferentiated
  neuroblasts. Ganglioneuroblastoma intermixed Schwannian stroma-rich GNBi-SR is predominantly
  composed of Schwannian stromal SS and neuroblastic Nb cells. There are contrasting
  reports suggesting that SS cells are non-neoplastic. In the present study, laser
  capture microdissection LCM was employed to isolate SS and Nb cells. Chromosome
  1p36 deletion and MYCN gene amplification were found to be associated in two out
  of seven NB-SPs, whereas no abnormalities were observed in five GNBi-SRs. In some
  cases, loss of heterozygosity LOH at 1p36 loci was detected in Nb cells but not
  in the bulk tumour by LCM furthermore, LOH was also identified in both SS and tumour
  tissue of a GNBi-SR. DNA gain and loss studied by comparative genomic hybridization
  were observed at several chromosome regions in NB-SP but in few regions of GNBi-SR.
  Finally, gene expression profiles studied using an oligo-microarray technique displayed
  two distinct signatures: in the first, 32 genes were expressed in NB-SP and in the
  second, 14 genes were expressed in GNBi-SR. The results show that NB-SP is composed
  of different morphologically indistinguishable malignant cell clones harbouring
  cryptic mutations that are detectable only after LCM. The degree of DNA imbalance
  is higher in NB-SP than in GNBi-SR. However, when the analysis of chromosome 1p36
  is performed at the level of microdissection, LOH is also observed in SS cells.
  These data provide supportive evidence that SS cells have a less aggressive phenotype
  and play a role in tumour maturation.'
