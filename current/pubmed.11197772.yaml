abstract: In our attempt to find characteristic genetic changes in resistant tumors,
  we screened the whole genome for gene aberrations in 28 primary ovarian cancers,
  using the comparative genomic hybridization CGH method. These cancers included 14
  tumors from patients who did not respond to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy
  in comparison with 14 tumors from patients who completely responded to the chemotherapy.
  We found gains in chromosomal region 1q21-q22 and 13q12-q14 to be related to the
  drug-resistant phenotype in ovarian cancer patients. Several genes encoding transcription
  factors, oncogenes, cell cycle regulators and regulators of the apoptotic pathway
  are found to be located on these regions of the chromosomes, and these genes are
  potential modulators for toxic insults in cancer cells. This is the first report
  that shows the relationship between certain genomic aberrations and clinical resistance
  for cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients based on the CGH analysis.
  Present findings suggest that these chromosomal gains may be potential indicators
  for prediction of resistance in ovarian cancer patients prior to cisplatin-based
  chemotherapy.
