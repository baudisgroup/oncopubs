abstract: 'We studied DNA copy number changes by CGH and allelic imbalance AI on 3p
  by LOH analysis on 22 phyllodes tumours PT of the breast in order to gain insight
  into the genetic basis of tumour progression in PT. Copy number changes were observed
  in 14 cases 63 . Gain in 1q with 1q21-23 as the minimal overlapping area was seen
  in 12 cases 55 . The gain was observed both in benign and malignant tumours. Our
  study did not reveal any DNA copy number changes or allelic loss on 3p. The results
  suggest that DNA copy number changes are not associated with the histological grade
  or clinical behaviour of PT and the chromosomal changes on 3p appear to be rare.
