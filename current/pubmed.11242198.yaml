abstract: Compared with HIV-negative individuals, HIV-positive individuals have a
  higher prevalence of anogenital human papillomavirus HPV infection, as well as a
  higher incidence of HPV-associated anal cancer. Little is currently known of chromosomal
  changes occurring in anal intraepithelial neoplasia AIN , the probable precursor
  to anal cancer. Genetic changes in AIN were characterized by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH in a study of samples obtained from 19 HIV-positive and 11 HIV-negative
  men. The proportion with genetic changes significantly increased with the severity
  of the histopathologic grade with none diagnosed as 0 AIN 1 5 of 17 29 as AIN 2
  and 5 of 9 56 AIN 3 showing genetic changes p .02 . This correlation was also found
  in study subjects who had multiple biopsies with different grades of pathology concurrently
  or serially over time. The most common regional DNA copy number change was gain
  mapped to chromosome arm 3q 12 of AIN 2 and 33 of AIN 3 . This alteration was previously
  reported to be commonest alteration in cervical cancer, which suggests a common
  molecular pathway for these two HPV-associated anogenital neoplasias.
