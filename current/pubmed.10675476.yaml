abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a well established technique in
  molecular cytogenetics. However, leukemias, and especially secondary acute myelogenous
  leukemias sAML are not very well analyzed by this technique, even though such diseases
  are often characterized by complex karyotypic changes, not resolvable by conventional
  cytogenetic banding analysis. This lack of CGH-studies might be due to the fact,
  that in most cases bone marrow aspirate is too limited to do DNA-extraction additionally
  to the cytogenetic analysis. To circumvent this problem a new CGH technique has
  been applied to analyze 10 AML cases with complex karyotypic changes. In each case
  15 interphase nuclei of the harvested and fixed bone marrow cell-suspension have
  been microdissected from the coverslip surface and collected in a tube. Subsequently,
  DNA was amplified by DOP-PCR. With this micro-CGH technique additional cytogenetic
  information from 10 highly aberrant AML cases was obtained and confirmed by FISH
  on metaphase of the corresponding AML case.
