abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma DIPG is one of the most frequent malignant
  pediatric brain tumor and its prognosis is universaly fatal. No significant improvement
  has been made in last thirty years over the standard treatment with radiotherapy.
  To address the paucity of understanding of DIPGs, we have carried out integrated
  molecular profiling of a large series of samples obtained with stereotactic biopsy
  at diagnosis. While chromosomal imbalances did not distinguish DIPG and supratentorial
  tumors on CGHarrays, gene expression profiling revealed clear differences between
  them, with brainstem gliomas resembling midline thalamic tumours, indicating a closely-related
  origin. Two distinct subgroups of DIPG were identified. The first subgroup displayed
  mesenchymal and pro-angiogenic characteristics, with stem cell markers enrichment
  consistent with the possibility to grow tumor stem cells from these biopsies. The
  other subgroup displayed oligodendroglial features, and appeared largely driven
  by PDGFRA, in particular through amplification and or novel missense mutations in
  the extracellular domain. Patients in this later group had a significantly worse
  outcome with an hazard ratio for early deaths, ie before 10 months, 8 fold greater
  that the ones in the other subgroup p 0.041, Cox regression model . The worse outcome
  of patients with the oligodendroglial type of tumors was confirmed on a series of
  55 paraffin-embedded biopsy samples at diagnosis median OS of 7.73 versus 12.37
  months, p 0.045, log-rank test . Two distinct transcriptional subclasses of DIPG
  with specific genomic alterations can be defined at diagnosis by oligodendroglial
  differentiation or mesenchymal transition, respectively. Classifying these tumors
  by signal transduction pathway activation and by mutation in pathway member genes
  may be particularily valuable for the development of targeted therapies.
