abstract: 'High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridisation aCGH analysis of
  DNA copy number aberrations CNAs was performed on breast carcinomas in premenopausal
  women from Western New York WNY and from Gomel, Belarus, an area exposed to fallout
  from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. Genomic DNA was isolated from 47 frozen
  tumour specimens from 42 patients and hybridised to arrays spotted with more than
  3000 BAC clones. In all, 20 samples were from WNY and 27 were from Belarus. In total,
  34 samples were primary tumours and 13 were lymph node metastases, including five
  matched pairs from Gomel. The average number of total CNAs per sample was 76 range
  35-134 . We identified 152 CNAs 92 gains and 60 losses occurring in more than 10
  of the samples. The most common amplifications included gains at 8q13.2 49 , at
  1p21.1 36 , and at 8q24.21 36 . The most common deletions were at 1p36.22 26 , at
  17p13.2 26 , and at 8p23.3 23 . Belarussian tumours had more amplifications and
  fewer deletions than WNY breast cancers. HER2 neu negativity and younger age were
  also associated with a higher number of gains and fewer losses. In the five paired
  samples, we observed more discordant than concordant DNA changes. Unsupervised hierarchical
  cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups of tumours: one comprised predominantly
  of Belarussian carcinomas and the other largely consisting of WNY cases. In total,
  50 CNAs occurred significantly more commonly in one cohort vs the other, and these
  included some candidate signature amplifications in the breast cancers in women
  exposed to significant radiation. In conclusion, our high-density aCGH study has
  revealed a large number of genetic aberrations in individual premenopausal breast
  cancer specimens, some of which had not been reported before. We identified a distinct
  CNA profile for carcinomas from a nuclear fallout area, suggesting a possible molecular
  fingerprint of radiation-associated breast cancer.'
