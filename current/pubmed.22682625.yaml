abstract: EVI1 is located on chromosome 3q26 and is up-regulated mostly through an
  inv 3 q21q26 or t 3 3 q21 q26 . Chromosomal aberrations involving 3q26 comprise
  1-2 of all acute myeloid leukemia AML . These changes result in overexpression of
  the EVI1 oncogene. EVI1 transcriptional activation has been reported in up to 10
  of AML patients, even in the absence of 3q26 changes, and is an independent indicator
  of adverse prognosis. Rearrangements of the EVI1 locus are often associated with
  monosomy 7. We present a case of acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis with a unique
  EVI1 amplification within a derivative 8 chromosome, characterized by karyotyping
  and fluorescence in situ hybridization, conventional high resolution comparative
  genomic hybridization, as well as by gene expression studies. We conclude that EVI1
  overexpression as a consequence of EVI1 gene amplification causes similar biological
  effects to the changes caused by the typical 3q26 aberrations such as an inv 3 q21q26
  or t 3 3 q21 q26 with EVI1 gene rearrangements.
