abstract: Cancer associated with smoking and drinking remains a serious health problem
  worldwide. The survival of patients is very poor due to the lack of effective early
  biomarkers. FOXM1 overexpression is linked to the majority of human cancers but
  its mechanism remains unclear in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC .
