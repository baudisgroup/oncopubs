abstract: Characteristic genetic changes underlying the metastatic progression of
  malignant melanoma is incompletely understood. The goal of our study was to explore
  specific chromosomal alterations associated with the aggressive behavior of this
  neoplasm. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed to screen and compare
  genomic imbalances present in primary and metastatic melanomas. Sixteen primary
  and 12 metastatic specimens were analyzed. We found that the pattern of chromosomal
  aberrations is similar in the two subgroups however, alterations present only in
  primary and or metastatic tumors were also discovered. The mean number of genetic
  changes was 6.3 range 1-14 in primary and 7.8 range 1-16 in metastatic lesions.
  Frequent losses involved 9p and 10q, whereas gains most often occurred at 1q, 6p,
  7q, and 8q. Distinct, high-level amplifications were mapped to 1p12-p21 and 1p22-p31
  in both tumor types. Amplification of 4q12-q13.1, 7q21.3-qter and 8q23-qter were
  detected only in primary tumors. The 20q13-qter amplicon was present in a metastatic
  tumor. The number of genetic alterations were significantly higher in primary tumors
  which developed metastases within one year after the surgery compared to tumors
  without metastasis during this time period. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with
  centromeric and locus-specific probes was applied to validate CGH results on a subset
  of tumors. Comparison of FISH and CGH data gave good correlation. The aggressive
  behavior of melanoma is associated with accumulation of multiple genetic alterations.
  Chromosome regions, which differ in the primary and metastatic lesions, may represent
  potential targets to identify metastases-related chromosomal alterations.
