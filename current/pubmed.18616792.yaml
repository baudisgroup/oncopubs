abstract: Today, no objective criteria exist to differentiate between individual primary
  tumors and intra- or intermammary dissemination respectively, in patients diagnosed
  with two or more synchronous breast cancers. To elucidate whether these tumors most
  likely arise through clonal expansion, or whether they represent individual primary
  tumors is of tumor biological interest and may have clinical implications. In this
  respect, high resolution genomic profiling may provide a more reliable approach
  than conventional histopathological and tumor biological factors.
