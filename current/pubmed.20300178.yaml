abstract: Partial gain of chromosome arm 17q is an abundant aberrancy in various cancer
  types such as lung and prostate cancer with a prominent occurrence and prognostic
  significance in neuroblastoma--one of the most common embryonic tumors. The specific
  genetic element s in 17q responsible for the cancer-promoting effect of these aberrancies
  is yet to be defined although many genes located in 17q have been proposed to play
  a role in malignancy. We report here the characterization of a naturally-occurring,
  non-reciprocal translocation der X t X 17 in human lung embryonal-derived cells
  following continuous culturing. This aberrancy was strongly correlated with an increased
  proliferative capacity and with an acquired ability to form colonies in vitro. The
  breakpoint region was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH to the 17q24.3
  locus. Further characterization by a custom-made comparative genome hybridization
  array CGH localized the breakpoint within the Bromodomain PHD finger Transcription
  Factor gene BPTF , a gene involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling.
  Interestingly, this translocation led to elevation in the mRNA levels of the endogenous
  BPTF. Knock-down of BPTF restricted proliferation suggesting a role for BPTF in
  promoting cellular growth. Furthermore, the BPTF chromosomal region was found to
  be amplified in various human tumors, especially in neuroblastomas and lung cancers
  in which 55 and 27 of the samples showed gain of 17q24.3, respectively. Additionally,
  42 percent of the cancer cell lines comprising the NCI-60 had an abnormal BPTF locus
  copy number. We suggest that deregulation of BPTF resulting from the translocation
  may confer the cells with the observed cancer-promoting phenotype and that our cellular
  model can serve to establish causality between 17q aberrations and carcinogenesis.
