abstract: Aneuploidy and translocations are hallmarks of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia ALL , but many individuals with this cancer lack recurring chromosomal
  alterations. Here we report a recurring interstitial deletion of the pseudoautosomal
  region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL that juxtaposes the first, noncoding
  exon of P2RY8 with the coding region of CRLF2. We identified the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion
  in 7 of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53 of individuals with ALL associated
  with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was associated with activating JAK mutations,
  and expression of human P2RY8-CRLF2 together with mutated mouse Jak2 resulted in
  constitutive Jak-Stat activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba F3 cells
  overexpressing interleukin-7 receptor alpha. Our findings indicate that these two
  genetic lesions together contribute to leukemogenesis in B-progenitor ALL.
