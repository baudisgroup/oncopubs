abstract: Juxtaglomerular cell tumors JGCT also known as reninomas are considered
  benign tumors of the kidney, although there have been reports of both malignant
  behavior and a JGCT-related death. The clinicopathologic features of these rare
  tumors are well established, whereas nothing is known about their cytogenetic characteristics.
