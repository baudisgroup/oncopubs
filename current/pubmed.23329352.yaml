abstract: Several ETS transcription factors are involved in the pathogenesis of human
  cancers by different mechanisms. As gene copy number gain amplification is an alternative
  mechanism of oncogenic activation and 1q gain is the most common copy number change
  in breast carcinoma, we investigated how that genomic change impacts in the expression
  of the three 1q ETS family members ETV3, ELK4, and ELF3. We have first evaluated
  141 breast carcinomas for genome-wide copy number changes by chromosomal CGH and
  showed that 1q21 and 1q32 were the two chromosome bands with most frequent genomic
  copy number gains. Second, we confirmed by FISH with locus-specific BAC clones that
  cases showing 1q gain amplification by CGH showed copy number increase of the ETS
  genes ETV3 located in 1q21 23 , ELF3, and ELK4 both in 1q32 . Third, gene expression
  levels of the three 1q ETS genes, as well as their potential targets MYC and CRISP3,
  were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. We here show for the first time that
  the most common genomic copy number gains in breast cancer, 1q21 and 1q32, are associated
  with overexpression of the ETS transcription factors ETV3 and ELF3 but not ELK4
  at these loci irrespective of molecular subtypes. Among the three 1q ETS genes,
  ELF3 has a relevant role in breast carcinogenesis and is also the most likely target
  of the 1q copy number increase. The basal-like molecular subtype presented the worst
  prognosis regarding disease-specific survival, but no additional prognostic value
  was found for 1q copy number status or ELF3 expression. In addition, we show that
  there is a correlation between the expression of the oncogene MYC, irrespectively
  of copy number gain at its loci in 8q24, and the expression of both the transcriptional
  repressor ETV3 and the androgen respondent ELK4.
