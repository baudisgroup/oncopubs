abstract: Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas DLBCL are highly heterogeneous with regard
  to clinical presentation and outcome. DLBCL copy number aberrations have been identified
  previously, of which the deletion at 6q21-24 was significantly associated with a
  highly favorable clinical response to chemotherapy. In this study, we aimed to identify
  genes implicated in this and other genomic regions with recurrent losses and or
  gains. To identify implicated genes, we superimposed array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH data onto a microarray expression dataset of 42 clinically well-characterized
  primary nodal DLBCL biopsies. We confirmed that loss of 6q21-24 is significantly
  associated with a highly favorable clinical response to chemotherapy. Our approach
  identified 316 significant genes restricted to 32 chromosomal regions, including
  24 genes identified at 6q21-24. In an independent dataset, 18 of overexpressed genes
  in gained regions and 55 of down-regulated genes in deleted regions were validated.
  In summary, using integrative genomics novel onco and tumor suppressor genes were
  identified in DLBCL that were not recognized by expression profiling alone.
