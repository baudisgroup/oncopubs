abstract: Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma BAC , a subtype of lung adenocarcinoma ADC
  without stromal, vascular, or pleural invasion, is considered an in situ tumor with
  a 100 survival rate. However, the histological criteria for invasion remain controversial.
  BAC-like areas may accompany otherwise invasive adenocarcinoma, referred to as mixed
  type adenocarcinoma with BAC features AWBF . AWBF are considered to evolve from
  BAC, representing a paradigm for malignant progression in ADC. However, the supporting
  molecular evidence remains forthcoming. Here, we have studied the genomic changes
  of BAC and AWBF by array comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We used submegabase-resolution
  tiling set array CGH to compare the genomic profiles of 14 BAC or BAC with focal
  area suspicious for invasion with those of 15 AWBF. Threshold-filtering and frequency-scoring
  analysis found that genomic profiles of noninvasive and focally invasive BAC are
  indistinguishable and show fewer aberrations than tumor cells in BAC-like areas
  of AWBF. These aberrations occurred mainly at the subtelomeric chromosomal regions.
  Increased genomic alterations were noted between BAC-like and invasive areas of
  AWBF. We identified 113 genes that best differentiated BAC from AWBF and were considered
  candidate marker genes for tumor invasion and progression. Correlative gene expression
  analyses demonstrated a high percentage of them to be poor prognosis markers in
  early stage ADC. Quantitative PCR also validated the amplification and overexpression
  of PDCD6 and TERT on chromosome 5p and the prognostic significance of PDCD6 in early
  stage ADC patients. We identified candidate genes that may be responsible for and
  are potential markers for malignant progression in AWBF.
