abstract: 'In a separate study F. Courjal et al., Cancer Res., 57: 4360-4367, 1997
  , we have analyzed by Southern blotting the relationship between DNA amplification
  and clinicopathological features of breast cancer. Six regions of recurrent amplifications
  were tested 8p12, 8q24, 11q13, 12q13, 17q12, and 20q13 , and the results suggested
  that there was a relationship between DNA amplification profiles and breast tumor
  phenotype. We had delineated three subgroups of tumors showing distinct DNA amplification
  profiles and clinicopathological characteristics: group A, tumors showing amplification
  at 11q13 and or 8p12 and or 20q13 group B, tumors amplified at ERBB2 and or MYC
  and or MDM2 SAS and group C, tumors with no detectable amplification. The aim of
  the present work was to characterize extensively the amplification profiles in the
  different subgroups of tumors. Sixty-one breast tumors distributed in all three
  subgroups were studied by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . There was an overall
  good agreement between Southern blotting results and CGH data. As expected, CGH
  revealed gains undetected by Southern blotting. Most of these gains occurred in
  regions for which no adapted probes were available but also revealed nondetected
  amplifications at 8q24 or 20q13. Tumors showed multiple aberrations with a medium
  number of 5.6 copy number variations tumor, whereas, according to Southern blotting
  results, 38 of the tumors analyzed were devoid of any amplification. This proportion
  fell to 6.5 after CGH analysis. Recurrent gains were observed in tumors from all
  three subgroups, albeit at varying incidences, and involved 1q, 8q, 17q23-q24, and
  20q13. Gains covered large regions of DNA and could possibly include several cores
  of amplification. Some events, such as gains at 16p11-p12 and 14q or losses at 22q,
  showed more restricted distributions, suggesting the existence of additional sets
  of preferential coamplifications. The complexity of genetic profiles revealed by
  CGH indicates that breast cancer development depends on a large yet undetermined
  number of genetic events. The description of molecular phenotypes in breast cancer
  may therefore prove to be complex, and it should be interesting to see how many
  breast tumor subtypes will be defined in the end.'
