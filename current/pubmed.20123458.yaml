abstract: Desmoplastic fibroma DF is a rare neoplasm of bone, showing infiltrative
  and locally aggressive nature. Here, we report a case of DF with an unusual histology
  arising in a 41-year-old female in the left distal femur, which was detected by
  plain x-ray as an osteolytic lesion and by magnetic resonance imaging as a well-demarcated
  mass with endosteal scalloping. Pathologically, the tumor was composed mainly of
  bland-looking spindle cells in abundant collagenous stroma, accompanied with areas
  of myxofibrosarcomatous and malignant fibrous histiocytomatous components. These
  histologically different areas were admixed with each other. The array-based comparative
  genomic hybridization study on the histologically different areas showed some specific
  gained or lost loci according to their histologic features. The specific genetic
  events and the histologic features of this case might represent the malignant transformation
  of DF.
