abstract: Genetic changes leading to the development of prostate cancer and factors
  that underlie the clinical progression of the disease are poorly characterized.
  Here, we used comparative genomic hybridization CGH to screen for DNA sequence copy
  number changes along all chromosomes in 31 primary and 9 recurrent uncultured prostate
  carcinomas. The aim of the study was to identify those chromosome regions that contain
  genes important for the development of prostate cancer and to identify genetic markers
  of tumor progression. CGH analysis indicated that 74 of primary prostate carcinoma
  showed DNA sequence copy number changes. Losses were 5 times more common than gains
  and most often involved 8p 32 , 13q 32 , 6q 22 , 16q 19 , 18q 19 , and 9p 16 . Allelic
  loss studies with 5 polymorphic microsatellite markers for 4 different chromosomes
  were done from 13 samples and showed a 76 concordance with CGH results. In local
  recurrences that developed during endocrine therapy, there were significantly more
  gains P amp lt 0.001 and losses P amp lt 0.05 of DNA sequences than in primary tumors,
  with gains of 8q found in 89 of recurrences versus 6 of primary tumors , X 56 versus
  0 , and 7 56 versus 10 , as well as loss of 8p 78 versus 32 , being particularly
  often involved. In conclusion, our CGH results indicate that losses of several chromosomal
  regions are common genetic changes in primary tumors, suggesting that deletional
  inactivation of putative tumor suppressor genes in these chromosomal sites is likely
  to underlie development of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the pattern of genetic
  changes seen in recurrent tumors with the frequent gains of 7, 8q, and X suggests
  that the progression of prostate cancer and development of hormone-independent growth
  may have a distinct genetic basis. These chromosome aberrations may have diagnostic
  utility as markers of prostate cancer progression.
