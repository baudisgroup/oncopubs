abstract: 'Cytogenetic classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is primarily
  based on numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities. In T-cell ALL (T-ALL),
  chromosomal rearrangements are identified in up to 70% of the patients while the
  remaining patients show a normal karyotype. In the present study, a 16-year-old
  male was diagnosed with T-precursor cell ALL and a normal karyotype after standard
  GTG-banding, was studied retrospectively (>10 years after diagnosis) in frame of
  a research project by molecular approaches. In addition to molecular cytogenetics,
  multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and high resolution array-comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) were also applied. Thus, the following yet unrecognized
  balanced chromosomal aberrations were detected: der(3)t(3;5)(p23;q31.1), der(5)t(3;5)(p23;q35.3),
  der(5)t(5;10)(q31.1;p12.3) and der(10)t(5;10)(q35.3;p12.3). The oncogene MLLT10
  was involved in this rearrangement as was the IL3 gene; in addition, trisomy 4 was
  present. All of these clonal aberrations were found in 40% of the cells. Even if
  this complex karyotype would have been identified at the time of diagnosis, most
  likely no other protocol of anticancer therapy (ALL-BFM 95) would have been applied.
  Three months after the end of a successful 2-year treatment, the patient suffered
  from isolated bone marrow relapse and died of sepsis during ALL-REZ-BFM protocol
  treatment.'
