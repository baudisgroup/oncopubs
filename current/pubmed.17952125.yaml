abstract: To identify genomic abnormalities characteristic of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  PDAC in vivo, a panel of 27 microdissected PDAC specimens were analysed using high-density
  microarrays representing approximately 116 000 single nucleotide polymorphism SNP
  loci. We detected frequent gains of 1q, 2, 3, 5, 7p, 8q, 11, 14q and 17q amp gt
  or 78 of cases , and losses of 1p, 3p, 6, 9p, 13q, 14q, 17p and 18q amp gt or 44
  . Although the results were comparable with those from array CGH, regions of those
  genetic changes were defined more accurately by SNP arrays. Integrating the Ensembl
  public data, we have generated gene copy number indices that facilitate the search
  for novel candidates involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Copy numbers in a subset
  of the genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. The SKAP2 SCAP2 gene
  7p15.2 , which belongs to the src family kinases, was most frequently 63 amplified
  in our sample set and its recurrent overexpression 67 was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR.
  Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization and in situ RNA hybridization analyses
  for this gene have demonstrated a significant correlation between DNA copy number
  and mRNA expression level in an independent sample set P amp lt 0.001 . These findings
  indicate that the dysregulation of SKAP2 SCAP2, which is mostly caused by its increased
  gene copy number, is likely to be associated with the development of PDAC.
