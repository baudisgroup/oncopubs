abstract: Additional chromosomal abnormalities are currently detected in Burkitts
  lymphoma. They play major roles in the progression of BL and in prognosis. The genes
  involved remain elusive. A whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH analysis correlated
  with karyotype and FISH was performed in a set of 27 Burkitts lymphoma-derived cell
  lines and primary tumors. More than half of the 145 CNAs amp lt 2 Mb were mapped
  to Mendelian CNVs, including GSTT1, glutathione s-transferase and BIRC6, an anti-apoptotic
  protein, possibly predisposing to some cancers. Somatic cell line-specific CNVs
  localized to the IG locus were consistently observed with the 244 K aCGH platform.
  Among 136 CNAs amp gt 2 Mb, gains were found in 1q 12 27 , 13q 7 27 , 7q 6 27 ,
  8q 4 27 , 2p 3 27 , 11q 2 27 and 15q 2 27 . Losses were found in 3p 5 27 , 4p 4
  27 , 4q 4 27 , 9p 4 27 , 13q 4 27 , 6p 3 27 , 17p 3 27 , 6q 2 27 ,11pterp13 2 27
  and 14q12q21.3 2 27 . Twenty one minimal critical regions MCR , range 0.04-71.36
  Mb , were delineated in tumors and cell lines. Three MCRs were localized to 1q.
  The proximal one was mapped to 1q21.1q25.2 with a 6.3 Mb amplicon 1q21.1q21.3 harboring
  BCA2 and PIAS3. In the other 2 MCRs, 1q32.1 and 1q44, MDM4 and AKT3 appeared as
  possible drivers of these gains respectively. The 13q31.3q32.1 amp lt 89.58-96.81
  amp gt MCR contained an amplicon and ABCC4 might be the driver of this amplicon.
  The 40 Kb 2p16.1 amp lt 60.96-61 amp gt MCR was the smallest gained MCR and specifically
  encompassed the REL oncogene which is already implicated in B cell lymphomas. The
  most frequently deleted MCR was 3p14.1 amp lt 60.43-60.53 amp gt that removed the
  fifth exon of FHIT. Further investigations which combined gene expression and functional
  studies are essential to understand the lymphomagenesis mechanism and for the development
  of more effective, targeted therapeutic strategies.
