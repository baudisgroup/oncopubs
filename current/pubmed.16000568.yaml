abstract: 'Medulloblastomas are the most common primary malignant childhood intracranial
  neoplasms. Patients are currently sorted into three risk groups based on clinical
  criteria: standard, poor, and infant amp lt 18 months old . We hypothesized that
  genetic copy number aberrations CNA predict prognosis and would provide improved
  criteria for predicting outcome.'
