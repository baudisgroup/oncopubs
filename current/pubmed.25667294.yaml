abstract: To uncover the genetic events leading to transformation of pediatric low-grade
  glioma (PLGG) to secondary high-grade glioma (sHGG).  We retrospectively identified
  patients with sHGG from a population-based cohort of 886 patients with PLGG with
  long clinical follow-up. Exome sequencing and array CGH were performed on available
  samples followed by detailed genetic analysis of the entire sHGG cohort. Clinical
  and outcome data of genetically distinct subgroups were obtained.  sHGG was observed
  in 2.9% of PLGGs (26 of 886 patients). Patients with sHGG had a high frequency of
  nonsilent somatic mutations compared with patients with primary pediatric high-grade
  glioma (HGG; median, 25 mutations per exome; P = .0042). Alterations in chromatin-modifying
  genes and telomere-maintenance pathways were commonly observed, whereas no sHGG
  harbored the BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion. The most recurrent alterations were BRAF V600E
  and CDKN2A deletion in 39% and 57% of sHGGs, respectively. Importantly, all BRAF
  V600E and 80% of CDKN2A alterations could be traced back to their PLGG counterparts.
  BRAF V600E distinguished sHGG from primary HGG (P = .0023), whereas BRAF and CDKN2A
  alterations were less commonly observed in PLGG that did not transform (P < .001
  and P < .001 respectively). PLGGs with BRAF mutations had longer latency to transformation
  than wild-type PLGG (median, 6.65 years [range, 3.5 to 20.3 years] v 1.59 years
  [range, 0.32 to 15.9 years], respectively; P = .0389). Furthermore, 5-year overall
  survival was 75% ï¿½ 15% and 29% ï¿½ 12% for children with BRAF mutant and wild-type
  tumors, respectively (P = .024).  BRAF V600E mutations and CDKN2A deletions constitute
  a clinically distinct subtype of sHGG. The prolonged course to transformation for
  BRAF V600E PLGGs provides an opportunity for surgical interventions, surveillance,
  and targeted therapies to mitigate the outcome of sHGG.  ï¿½ 2015 by American Society
