abstract: To screen pancreatic carcinomas for chromosomal aberrations we have applied
  molecular cytogenetic techniques, including fluorescent in situ hybridization, comparative
  genomic hybridization, and spectral karyotyping to a series of nine established
  cell lines. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed recurring chromosomal gains
  on chromosome arms 3q, 5p, 7p, 8q, 12p, and 20q. Chromosome losses were mapped to
  chromosome arms 8p, 9p, 17p, 18q, 19p, and chromosome 21. The comparison with comparative
  genomic hybridization data from primary pancreatic tumors indicates that a specific
  pattern of chromosomal copy number changes is maintained in cell culture. Metaphase
  chromosomes from six cell lines were analyzed by spectral karyotyping, a technique
  that allows one to visualize all chromosomes simultaneously in different colors.
  Spectral karyotyping identified multiple chromosomal rearrangements, the majority
  of which were unbalanced. No recurring reciprocal translocation was detected. Cytogenetic
  aberrations were confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization with probes for
  the MDR gene and the tumor suppressor genes p16 and DCC. Copy number increases on
  chromosome 20q were validated with a probe specific for the nuclear receptor coactivator
  AIB1 that maps to chromosome 20q12. Amplification of this gene was identified in
  six of nine pancreatic cancer cell lines and correlated with increased expression.
