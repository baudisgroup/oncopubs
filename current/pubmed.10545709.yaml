abstract: We applied the technique of comparative genomic hybridization CGH to a series
  of 16 hepatoblastomas. Our goals were 1 to identify all quantitative chromosome
  abnormalities that appear in this type of tumor and 2 to compare the results with
  data from similar studies on other tumors associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann
  syndrome BWS . We found that the most commonly detected amp gt 30 chromosome abnormalities
  were gains of chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8, and 17. Losses of chromosomes were found in
  only a few cases. On comparing our results with those from studies on the BWS-associated
  tumors, Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma, it became clear that three chromosome
  regions, namely, 7q, 8q, and 17q, were the ones most commonly involved in all three
  types of tumors. These regions, therefore, may harbor genes that play a role in
  the etiology of BWS-associated tumors in general.
