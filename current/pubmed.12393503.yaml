abstract: Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCLs) represent a heterogeneous group of extranodal
  T- and B-cell malignancies. The underlying molecular pathogenesis of this malignancy
  remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize oncogene abnormalities in PCLs.
  Using genomic microarray, we detected oncogene copy number gains of RAF1 (3p25),
  CTSB (8p22), PAK1 (11q13), and JUNB (19p13) in 5 of 7 cases of mycosis fungoides
  (MF)/Sezary syndrome (SS) (71%), gains of FGFR1 (8p11), PTPN (20q13), and BCR (22q11)
  in 4 cases (57%), and gains of MYCL1 (1p34), PIK3CA (3q26), HRAS (11p15), MYBL2
  (20q13), and ZNF217 (20q13) in 3 cases (43%). Amplification of JUNB was studied
  in 104 DNA samples from 78 PCL cases using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
  Twenty-four percent of cases, including 7 of 10 cases of primary cutaneous CD30(+)
  anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (C-ALCL), 4 of 14 MF, 4 of 22 SS, and 2 of 23 primary
  cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL) showed amplification of JUNB, and high-level amplification
  of this oncogene was present in 3 C-ALCL and 2 MF cases. JUNB protein expression
  was analyzed in tissue sections from 69 PCL cases, and 44% of cases, consisting
  of 21 of 23 SS, 6 of 8 C-ALCL, 5 of 10 MF, and 9 of 21 PCBCL, demonstrated nuclear
  expression of JUNB by tumor cells. Overexpression of JUNB also was detected in 5
  C-ALCL and 2 SS cases. These results have revealed, for the first time, amplification
  and expression patterns of JUNB in PCL, suggesting that JUNB may be critical in
  the pathogenesis of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.

  insufficient for whole genome coverage. Also, samples had been reported previously
