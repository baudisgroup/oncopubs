abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis is currently used as
  a first tier test for pediatric brain tumors at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
  The results from 100 consecutive patients are summarized in the present report.
  Eighty-seven percent of the tumors had at least one pathogenic copy number alteration.
  Nineteen of 56 low grade gliomas (LGGs) demonstrated a duplication in 7q34, which
  resulted in a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Chromosome band 7q34 deletions, which resulted
  in a FAM131B-BRAF fusion, were identified in one pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and
  one dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT). One ganglioglioma (GG) demonstrated
  a 6q23.3q26 deletion that was predicted to result in a MYB-QKI fusion. Gains of
  chromosomes 5, 6, 7, 11, and 20 were seen in a subset of LGGs. Monosomy 6, deletion
  of 9q and 10q, and an i(17)(q10) were each detected in the medulloblastomas (MBs).
  Deletions and regions of loss of heterozygosity that encompassed TP53, RB1, CDKN2A/B,
  CHEK2, NF1, and NF2 were identified in a variety of tumors, which led to a recommendation
  for germline testing. A BRAF p.Thr599dup or p.V600E mutation was identified by Sanger
  sequencing in one and five gliomas, respectively, and a somatic TP53 mutation was
  identified in a fibrillary astrocytoma. No TP53 hot-spot mutations were detected
  in the MBs. SNP array analysis of pediatric brain tumors can be combined with pathologic
  examination and molecular analyses to further refine diagnoses, offer more accurate
  prognostic assessments, and identify patients who should be referred for cancer
  risk assessment.  Copyright ï¿½ 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
