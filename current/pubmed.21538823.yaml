abstract: Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization, karyotype and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization analyses were employed to delineate the cytogenetic abnormalities
  in a case of pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Here we present a unique
  genetic profile that includes bi-allelic deletions within 13q14, where the retinoblastoma
  tumor suppressor gene RB1 resides, as well as isolated trisomy 21 without a concomitant
  mutation in the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1s and translocation 17 22
  , that does not involve the megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 MKL1 gene located on chromosome
  22. Alteration of the RB1 gene is most likely the critical leukemogenic event in
  this patient.
