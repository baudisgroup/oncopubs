abstract: We analyzed MET protein and copy number in NSCLC with or without EGFR mutations
  untreated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs . MET copy number was examined
  in 28 NSCLC and 4 human bronchial epithelial cell lines HBEC and 100 primary tumors
  using quantitative real-time PCR. Positive results were confirmed by array comparative
  genomic hybridization and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Total and phospho-MET
  protein expression was determined in 24 NSCLC and 2 HBEC cell lines using Western
  blot. EGFR mutations were examined for exon 19 deletions, T790M, and L858R. Knockdown
  of EGFR with siRNA was performed to examine the relation between EGFR and MET activation.
  High-level MET amplification was observed in 3 of 28 NSCLC cell lines and in 2 of
  100 primary lung tumors that had not been treated with EGFR-TKIs. MET protein was
  highly expressed and phosphorylated in all the 3 cell lines with high MET amplification.
  In contrast, 6 NSCLC cell lines showed phospho-MET among 21 NSCLC cell lines without
  MET amplification p 0.042 . Furthermore, those 6 cell lines harboring phospho-MET
  expression without MET amplification were all EGFR mutant p 0.0039 . siRNA-mediated
  knockdown of EGFR abolished phospho-MET expression in examined 3 EGFR mutant cell
  lines of which MET gene copy number was not amplified. By contrast, phospho-MET
  expression in 2 cell lines with amplified MET gene was not down-regulated by knockdown
  of EGFR. Our results indicated that MET amplification was present in untreated NSCLC
  and EGFR mutation or MET amplification activated MET protein in NSCLC.
