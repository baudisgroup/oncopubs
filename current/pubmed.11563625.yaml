abstract: Four pituitary carcinoma metastases two adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH
  and prolactin cell tumors each were studied by comparative genomic hybridization.
  Chromosomal gains were found in all four carcinoma metastases, but losses only in
  the two prolactin cell carcinoma metastases. Overall, pituitary carcinoma metastases
  showed an average of 8.3 chromosomal imbalances per tumor 7 gains vs 1.3 losses
  , 10 in prolactin cell carcinoma metastases 7.5 gains vs 2.5 losses and 6.5 in ACTH
  cell carcinoma metastases 6.5 gains vs 0 loss . The most common changes were gains
  of chromosome 5, 7p, and 14q in three tumors each . High-level gains were found
  on 13q22-qter and 14q two cases each and on 1q, 3p, 7, 8, 9p, and 21q one case each
  . To date, gains of chromosome 14q have not been reported among pituitary tumors.
  It remains to be shown whether gain of 14q is associated with malignant progression
  and metastatic dissemination of pituitary carcinomas.
