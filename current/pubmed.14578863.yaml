abstract: We investigated 39 primary hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs for aberrations
  in DNA copy number, using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Gain of DNA at
  8q was common in these tumors high-level gains, indicative of gene amplification,
  occurred most frequently at 8q23-q24. Gains of 8q correlated with large amp gt 5
  cm tumor size. To identify targets of the amplification events involving 8q, we
  determined expression levels of 14 candidate genes within that region in a total
  of 41 HCCs by means of real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
  reactions RT-PCR . Significant correlation was found between elevated levels of
  expression and increases in copy number for PTK2 located at 8q24.3 and EIF3S3 at
  8q23.3 , but for none of the other candidates, which included MYC 8q24.1 . Southern
  blot analyses confirmed that PTK2 and EIF3S3 were amplified, respectively, in 5
  19 and 7 26 of the 27 tumors examined in accordance with expression patterns, an
  indication that expression of PTK2 and EIF3S3 was probably up-regulated by the amplification
  mechanism. When we analyzed potential relationships between elevated expression
  of PTK2 and EIF3S3 and clinicopathologic parameters, high expression of the 2 transcripts
  was significantly associated with large amp gt 5 cm tumor size and with hepatitis
  B virus HBV infection. In conclusion, PTK2 and EIF3S3, which, respectively, encode
  focal adhesion kinase and the p40 subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3,
  were probable targets within the amplification at 8q23-q24 and may be involved in
  progression of HCC.
