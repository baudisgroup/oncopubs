abstract: Familial occurrence of gliomas, in the absence of well-defined hereditary
  multisystem disorders, is reported occasionally. We describe 17 families that have
  been afflicted with two or more gliomas but do not raise suspicion of other inheritable
  syndromes. The families were identified among 369 consecutive glioma patients operated
  at the Tampere University Hospital during 1983-1994. We applied comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH analysis on 21 gliomas occurring in these 17 families. The most
  frequent genetic alterations, detected in over 20 of the tumors, were losses of
  6q, 10, 4q, 9p and gains of 7, 19, 20q, 1p. We compared the chromosomal alterations
  detected in the familial gliomas to those reported previously on 209 sporadic gliomas
  in nine different CGH studies. In this comparison, the familial gliomas more often
  showed losses of chromosome arms 4q and 6q and gains of 1p and 22q. The most frequent
  losses 9 21 tumors in the familial gliomas resided on chromosome arm 6q P 0.005,
  Fishers exact test with Bonferroni correction, P 0.04 . The loss of 6q was also
  the most common intrafamilial aberration, present in four separate gliomas belonging
  to two families. The minimal common area of loss on this chromosome resided at 6q14-16.
  In conclusion, we have found several characteristic aberrations by CGH in the familial
  gliomas and we present new chromosomal regions possibly involved in the familial
  predisposition to gliomas.
