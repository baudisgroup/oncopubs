abstract: The search for oncogenes is becoming increasingly important in cancer genetics
  because they are suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. To identify novel
  oncogenes, activated by gene amplification, we analyzed cDNA microarrays by high-resolution
  comparative genome hybridization and compared DNA copy number and mRNA expression
  levels in lung cancer cell lines. We identified several amplicons 5p13, 6p22-21,
  11q13, 17q21 and 19q13 that had a concomitant increase in gene expression. These
  regions were also found to be amplified in lung primary tumours. We mapped the boundaries
  and measured expression levels of genes within the chromosome 6p amplicon. The Sry-HMG
  box gene SOX4 sex-determining region Y box 4 , which encodes a transcription factor
  involved in embryonic cell differentiation, was overexpressed by a factor of 10
  in cells with amplification relative to normal cells. SOX4 expression was also stronger
  in a fraction of lung primary tumours and lung cancer cell lines and was associated
  with the presence of gene amplification. We also found variants of SOX4 in lung
  primary tumours and cancer cell lines, including a somatic mutation that introduced
  a premature stop codon S395X at the serine-rich C-terminal domain. Although none
  of the variants increased the transactivation ability of SOX4, overexpression of
  the wildtype and of the non-truncated variants in NIH3T3 cells significantly increased
  the transforming ability of the weakly oncogenic RHOA-Q63L. In conclusion, our results
  show that, in lung cancer, SOX4 is overexpressed due to gene amplification and provide
  evidence of oncogenic properties of SOX4.
