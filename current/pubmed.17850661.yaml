abstract: Age is one of the most important risk factors for human malignancies, including
  breast cancer in addition, age at diagnosis has been shown to be an independent
  indicator of breast cancer prognosis. Except for inherited forms of breast cancer,
  however, there is little genetic or epigenetic understanding of the biological basis
  linking aging with sporadic breast cancer incidence and its clinical behavior.
