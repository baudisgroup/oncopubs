abstract: 'Comparative genomic hybridization CGH has been applied to detect recurrent
  chromosome alterations in 62 primary gastric carcinomas. Several nonrandom chromosomal
  changes, including gains of 8q 31 cases, 50 , 20q 29 cases, 47 with a minimum gain
  region at 20q11. 2-q12, 13q 21 cases, 34 with a minimum gain region at 13q22, and
  3q 19 cases, 31 were commonly observed. The regions most frequently lost included:
  19p 23 cases, 37 , 17p 21 cases, 33 , and 1p 14 cases, 23 . High copy number gain
  DNA sequence amplification was detected in 6 cases. Amplification of 8q23-q24.2
  and 20q11.2-q12 were observed in 3 cases. Gain of 20q and loss of 19p were confirmed
  by fluorescence in situ hybridization using corresponding bacterial artificial chromosomes
  BAC clones from those regions. The gain and loss of chromosomal regions identified
  in this study provide candidate regions involved in gastric tumorigenesis.'
