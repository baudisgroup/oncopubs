abstract: It has been increasingly recognized that ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS ,
  lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS and invasive cancer of the breast are often closely
  associated with one another. However, the genomic relationship between these histologically
  distinct entities has not been well characterized. Refinements in high-resolution
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH techniques allow for a detailed comparison
  of genomic alterations in synchronously occurring tumors. The following case illustrates
  how array CGH may be used to better understand whether synchronous neoplasms share
  a common origin.
