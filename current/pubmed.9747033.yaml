abstract: Double minute chromosomes dmin are cytogenetic hallmarks of amplified genes.
  Using spectral karyotyping SKY and comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we identified
  the origin of amplified DNA in a leukemic cell line, KY821, that harbors numerous
  dmin. The SKY revealed that the DNA sequences of dmin are derived from materials
  of chromosome 8, and CGH showed a high degree of overrepresentation only at 8q22-24,
  indicating that in KY821 only chromosomal material of 8q22-24, containing MYC, is
  amplified in dmin. An approach combining SKY with CGH should facilitate efforts
  to identify novel chromosomal regions of gene amplification and contribute information
  about genetic lesions that underly neoplastic tumors.
