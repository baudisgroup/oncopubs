abstract: We have explored the potential role of genetics in the development of osteonecrosis
  of the jaw ONJ in multiple myeloma MM patients under bisphosphonate therapy. A genome-wide
  association study was performed using 500 568 single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs
  in 2 series of homogeneously treated MM patients, one with ONJ 22 MM cases and another
  without ONJ 65 matched MM controls . Four SNPs rs1934951, rs1934980, rs1341162,
  and rs17110453 mapped within the cytochrome P450-2C gene CYP2C8 showed a different
  distribution between cases and controls with statistically significant differences
  P 1.07 x 10 -6 , P 4.231 x 10 -6 , P 6.22 x 10 -6 , and P 2.15 x 10 -6 , respectively
  . SNP rs1934951 was significantly associated with a higher risk of ONJ development
  even after Bonferroni correction P corrected value .02 . Genotyping results displayed
  an overrepresentation of the T allele in cases compared with controls 48 vs 12 .
  Thus, individuals homozygous for the T allele had an increased likelihood of developing
  ONJ odds ratio 12.75, 95 confidence interval 3.7-43.5 .
