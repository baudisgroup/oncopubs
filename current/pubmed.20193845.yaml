abstract: We have performed a retrospective array-based comparative hybridization
  array-CGH study on 41 acute leukemia samples n 17 acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL
  patients only at diagnosis, n 3 ALL patients both at diagnosis and relapse n 20
  acute myeloid leukemia AML patients only at diagnosis and n 1 AML patient both at
  diagnosis and relapse using an Agilent 44K array. In addition to previously detected
  cytogenetic aberrations, we observed cryptic aberrations in 95 of ALL and 90.5 of
  AML cases. ALL-specific recurrent abnormalities were RB1 n 3 , PAX5 n 4 , and CDKN2B
  n 3 deletions AML-specific recurrent abnormalities were HOXA9 and HOXA10 n 2 deletions
  and NOTCH1 duplication n 2 . Recurrent duplication of the ELK1 oncogene was observed
  in both ALL n 2 and AML n 3 cases. Our results demonstrate that oligo-array CGH
  oaCGH is an effective method for defining copy number alterations and identification
  of novel recurring unbalanced abnormalities. At least for now, however, the use
  of oaCGH for routine diagnosis still has some restrictions.
