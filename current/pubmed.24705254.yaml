abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma DIPG is a fatal brain cancer that arises
  in the brainstem of children, with no effective treatment and near 100 fatality.
  The failure of most therapies can be attributed to the delicate location of these
  tumors and to the selection of therapies on the basis of assumptions that DIPGs
  are molecularly similar to adult disease. Recent studies have unraveled the unique
  genetic makeup of this brain cancer, with nearly 80 found to harbor a p.Lys27Met
  histone H3.3 or p.Lys27Met histone H3.1 alteration. However, DIPGs are still thought
  of as one disease, with limited understanding of the genetic drivers of these tumors.
  To understand what drives DIPGs, we integrated whole-genome sequencing with methylation,
  expression and copy number profiling, discovering that DIPGs comprise three molecularly
  distinct subgroups H3-K27M, silent and MYCN and uncovering a new recurrent activating
  mutation affecting the activin receptor gene ACVR1 in 20 of DIPGs. Mutations in
  ACVR1 were constitutively activating, leading to SMAD phosphorylation and increased
  expression of the downstream activin signaling targets ID1 and ID2. Our results
  highlight distinct molecular subgroups and novel therapeutic targets for this incurable
  pediatric cancer.
