abstract: Wilms tumour WT is a pediatric tumor of the kidney that arises via failure
  of the fetal developmental program. The absence of identifiable mutations in the
  majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT.
  We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs
  and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases kb and
  more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-protocadherin
  PCDH gene clusters Human Genome Organization nomenclature PCDHA , PCDHB , and PCDHG
  , respectively . This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing LRES occurs
  in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction
  analysis showed that PCDH hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms
  tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced PCDH expression in tumors.
  WT precursor lesions showed no PCDH hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo PCDH
  hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the
  PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications unmethylated
  genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from
  methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive
  histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney
  and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that Pcdh expression
  is developmentally regulated and that Pcdhg genes are expressed in blastemal cells.
  Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as
  short-interfering RNA-induced reduction of PCDHG encoded proteins leads to elevated
  beta-catenin protein, increased beta-catenin T-cell factor TCF reporter activity,
  and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses
  beta-catenin TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth
  of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate
  regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.
