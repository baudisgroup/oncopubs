abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Intracranial pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs) are rare and
  heterogeneous neoplasms and vary in histological differentiation, prognosis and
  clinical behavior. Germinoma and mature teratoma are GCTs that have a good prognosis,
  while other types of GCTs, termed nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors (NGMGCTs),
  are tumors with an intermediate or poor prognosis. The second group of tumors requires
  more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimens. The mechanisms underlying
  the differences in incidence and prognosis of the various GCT subgroups are unclear.
  RESULTS: We identified a distinct mRNA profile correlating with GCT histological
  differentiation and prognosis, and also present in this study the first miRNA profile
  of pediatric primary intracranial GCTs. Most of the differentially expressed miRNAs
  were downregulated in germinomas, but miR-142-5p and miR-146a were upregulated.
  Genes responsible for self-renewal (such as POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG and KLF4) and the
  immune response were abundant in germinomas, while genes associated with neuron
  differentiation, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (including SNAI2 (SLUG) and TWIST2) were abundant in NGMGCTs. Clear transcriptome
  segregation based on patient survival was observed, with malignant NGMGCTs being
  closest to embryonic stem cells. Chromosome copy number variations (CNVs) at cytobands
  4q13.3-4q28.3 and 9p11.2-9q13 correlated with GCT malignancy and clinical risk.
  Six genes (BANK1, CXCL9, CXCL11, DDIT4L, ELOVL6 and HERC5) within 4q13.3-4q28.3
  were more abundant in germinomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our results integrate molecular profiles
  with clinical observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms causing
  GCT malignancy. The genes, pathways and microRNAs identified have the potential
  to be novel therapeutic targets.'
