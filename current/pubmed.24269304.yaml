abstract: Cytogenetic methods, including G-banded chromosome analysis and fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH analysis, serve as a critical part of routine clinical
  testing for hematological malignancies and provide important diagnostic and prognostic
  information however, the limitations of cytogenetic methods, including the requirement
  for actively dividing cells and lower resolution of G-banded chromosome analysis
  as well as the inability of both G-banded chromosome analysis and FISH to detect
  copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity CN-LOH , can result in a failure to detect
  genomic abnormalities with diagnostic and prognostic significance. Here, we compared
  the abnormality detection rate of clinically requested testing i.e., G-banded chromosome
  analysis and FISH with high-resolution oligo i.e., array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH and single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP oligo hybrid i.e., SNP-CGH arrays in
  a series of patients, in an effort to assess the ability of newer technologies to
  overcome these limitations. This series found the detection rate for SNP-CGH to
  be 62.5 for myelodysplastic syndrome MDS cases and 72.7 for chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL cases, which are significantly higher than the detection rates of aCGH
  31.3 for MDS and 54.5 for CLL and G-banding and or FISH 43.8 for MDS and 54.5 for
  CLL . This demonstrates the advantages of combining SNP-CGH with conventional cytogenetics
  to provide comprehensive clinical information by detecting clonality, large balanced
  rearrangements, copy number aberrations, and CN-LOH.
