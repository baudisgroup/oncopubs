abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was applied for a comprehensive screening
  of chromosomal aberrations in 14 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder of
  different grade and stage. The results were compared in a number of selected cases
  with those obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses and targeted
  fluorescence in situ hybridization. Distinct amplifications, found with CGH, were
  located on 3p22-24, 10p13-14, 12q13-15, 17q22-23, 18p11, and 22q11-13. These high
  copy number amplifications and the frequency of imbalances involving chromosome
  5, occurring in 4 of 14 cases, have not yet been identified in transitional cell
  carcinomas. Apart from these new aberrations, imbalances were detected in 3 or more
  cases for chromosomes 9 and 11, as already described previously in the literature.
  In four tumors, the copy number of specific chromosomal regions was also analyzed
  by interphase cytogenetics. Although in most instances the CGH data were confirmed,
  in one tumor, distinct differences were observed, possibly a result of heterogeneity
  of the tumor cell population. Furthermore, the CGH data were compared with loss
  of heterozygosity as revealed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
  in the same tumors. In 80 of informative cases, no loss was detected by restriction
  fragment length polymorphism or by CGH. Of the 15 cases of loss of heterozygosity,
  7 showed a loss also with CGH, whereas in 8 cases no loss was observed. In summary,
  CGH is a fast method to obtain a comprehensive picture of chromosomal imbalances
  in transitional cell carcinomas, including a number of previously unknown genomic
  alterations such as high level amplifications.
