abstract: Small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL is morphologically and immunologically similar
  to chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL , and the new REAL classification refers to
  them as a single disease termed SLL CLL. Recently, frequent losses in 6q, 11q and
  or 13q were observed in CLL using comparative genomic hybridization CGH . We performed
  CGH analyses in order to find out whether these two entities contain the same DNA
  copy number changes.
