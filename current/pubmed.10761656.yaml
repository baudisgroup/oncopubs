abstract: Human tumors implanted as subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice are widely
  used for the study of tumor biology and therapy. Validation of these models requires
  knowledge of the genetic makeup of the xenografts. The aim of this study was to
  establish whether chromosomal imbalances in 11 xenograft lines derived from human
  glioblastomas multiforme x-GBMs are similar to those found in GBM biopsy samples.
  The authors also studied genetic stability during serial passaging of three xenograft
  lines.
