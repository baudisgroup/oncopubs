abstract: To determine early somatic changes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC),
  we performed whole genome sequencing on a rare collection of 16 low stage HGSOCs.
  The majority showed extensive structural alterations (one had an ultramutated profile),
  exhibited high levels of p53 immunoreactivity, and harboured TP53 mutation, deletion
  or inactivation. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were observed in two tumors, with nine
  showing evidence of a homologous recombination (HR) defect. Combined analysis with
  The Cancer Genome Atlas indicated that low and late stage HGSOCs have similar mutation
  and copy number profiles. We also found evidence that deleterious TP53 mutations
  are the earliest events, followed by deletions or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of
  chromosomes carrying TP53, BRCA1 or BRCA2. Inactivation of HR appears to be an early
  event, as 62.5% of tumours showed a LOH pattern suggestive of HR defects. Three
  tumours with the highest ploidy had little genome-wide LOH, yet one of these had
  a homozygous somatic frame-shift BRCA2 mutation, suggesting that some carcinomas
  begin as tetraploid then descend into diploidy accompanied by genome-wide LOH. Lastly,
  we found evidence that structural variants (SV) cluster in HGSOC, but are absent
  in one ultramutated tumor, providing insights into the pathogenesis of low stage
  HGSOC.  ï¿½ The Author(s) 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of
