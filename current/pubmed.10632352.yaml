abstract: Amplification of the ERBB2 oncogene has recently received attention as a
  target for antibody-based therapies and as a predictor of response to adjuvant chemotherapy.
  Modification of treatment strategies based on ERBB2 status has led to further interest
  in the genetic alterations that accompany ERBB2 gene amplification or overexpression.
  In this study, chromosome alterations that are associated with ERBB2 amplification
  were defined by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Additionally, fluorescence
  in situ hybridization FISH was used to validate gene amplification, and protein
  expression was detected immunohistochemically. ERBB2-amplified tumors as detected
  by FISH, immunohistochemistry IHC , or CGH had twice as many CGH-defined chromosomal
  alterations means of 11.8, 11.0, and 12.7, respectively as the nonamplified tumors
  means of 6.8, 7.0, and 5.6, respectively . ERBB2 positivity correlated with the
  total number of genetic events. A wide spectrum of copy number gains and losses
  was seen by CGH in all of the tumors. An increased number of losses of 18q and gains
  of 20q was found in ERBB2-positive tumors. Other common aberrations for all of the
  tumors were copy number gains of 1q 58 , 8q 52 , 20q 30 , and losses of 18q 39 ,
  13q 39 , and 3p 33 . A high degree of concordance was observed among the three methods
  in 33 primary breast cancers. The concurrence for ERBB2 detection between FISH and
  IHC was 90 , between FISH and CGH was 82 , and between IHC and CGH was 84 . This
  study shows that breast tumors showing erbB2 overexpression or gene amplification
  are genetically distinct from erbB2-negative tumors. These differences may relate
  to the mechanisms underlying altered response to adjuvant therapies and may define
  the responsiveness to erbB2-directed immunotherapy.
