abstract: The median survival for human malignant glioma patients treated with neurosurgery
  and postoperative radiotherapy does not exceed one year. Only a minority of patients
  benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. It was the aim of our study to determine which
  genomic alterations in malignant gliomas modulate the sensitivity to chemotherapy
  or cytotoxic cytokines such as CD95 ligand CD95L or Apo2L tumor necrosis factor-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand Apo2L TRAIL . Therefore, we analyzed 12 human malignant
  glioma cell lines for chromosomal gains and losses by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . The gains most commonly identified were on chromosomes 7q, 19, 1, and 20q,
  whereas the most frequent losses were on 13q, 11q, 18q, and 4q. By comparison with
  previously published data on this panel of glioma cell lines1112, we defined candidate
  regions which may carry genes responsible for sensitivity to chemotherapy or cytotoxic
  cytokines. All but one of the chromosomal regions associated with response to chemotherapy,
  i.e. 1p12, 3p21, 11p11.2-p13, 12q23, 17p11. 2-p13, were different from those associated
  with response to cytotoxic cytokines, i.e. lp12, 1q22, 12q12-q21. Genomic regions
  known to harbor major candidate genes, including genes encoding death ligands, death
  receptors, caspases and BCL-2 family proteins, were not found to be imbalanced.
  In addition, we identified 5q13-q14, 5q34, 10p11.2, 9q21-q34 as genomic regions
  associated with the proliferative activity of malignant glioma cell lines. Cell
  lines with gain on proximal 5q, where CCNB1 and CCNH reside, showed an increased
  growth rate, suggesting that cyclins activating cdc2, the dominant G2 M phase kinase,
  may play a role in glioma tumorigenes.
