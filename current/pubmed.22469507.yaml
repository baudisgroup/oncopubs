abstract: Wilms tumors have characteristic chromosomal abnormalities, such as the
  11p13 deletion, in a subset of cases. This is one of the very few reports comparing
  single nucleotide polymorphism SNP array analysis with conventional karyotyping
  of Wilms tumors. A total of 43 frozen tumor samples were analyzed using the Affymetrix
  Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7M array. The findings from the SNP array analysis were
  then compared with those from conventional karyotyping. A comparison between SNP
  array and conventional karyotype findings was possible in 38 of 43 specimens 88.4
  . The SNP array and classic cytogenetic results were concordant in 33 of 38 specimens
  87 . SNP array analysis was able to support the findings of classic cytogenetics.
  The SNP array detected regions of loss of heterozygosity LOH in 41 of 43 95 specimens.
  However, it did not detect balanced translocations and inversions that were observed
  by conventional cytogenetics. Our results show that the data generated from these
  platforms are complementary. The SNP array also detected additional gains and losses
  as well as regions of LOH with associated disomy, which are likely to represent
  segmental uniparental disomy. The observed discrepancies can be explained by the
  inherent limitations of each technique.
