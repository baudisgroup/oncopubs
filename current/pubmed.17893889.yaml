abstract: We have examined chromosomal-scale mutations in 34 large colorectal adenomas
  CRAs . A small number of changes median 2, IQR 0-4 were found by array-comparative
  genomic hybridization aCGH in most tumours. The most common changes were deletions
  of chromosomes 1p, 9q, 17, 19, and 22, and gains of chromosomes 13 and 21. SNP-LOH
  analysis and pseudo-digital SNP-PCR analysis detected occasional copy-neutral LOH.
  Some aCGH changes found frequently in colorectal carcinomas, such as deletions of
  chromosomes 4q and 18q, were very infrequent in the adenomas. Almost all copy number
  changes were of small magnitude, far below the predicted levels even for single
  copy gain loss investigation suggested that these changes were either artefactual
  or occurred in sub-clones within the tumours. In some cases, these sub-clones may
  have represented progression towards carcinoma, but comparison with aCGH data from
  carcinomas showed this to be unlikely in most cases. In two adenomas, there was
  evidence of a large, outlying number of copy number changes, mostly resulting from
  part-chromosome deletions. Overall, moreover, there was evidence of a tendency towards
  part-chromosome deletions-consistent with chromosomal instability CIN --in about
  one-sixth of all tumours. However, there was no evidence of CIN in the form of whole-chromosome
  copy number changes. Our data did not support previous contentions that CRAs tend
  to show chromosome breakage at fragile sites owing to CIN associated with an elevated
  DNA damage response. Chromosomal-scale mutations occur in some CRAs although CIN
  is not the norm in these lesions, it probably affects a minority of cases.
