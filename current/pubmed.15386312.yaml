abstract: The widespread use of prostate-specific antigen PSA testing to screen for
  prostate carcinoma has led to significant overdiagnosis, due to the frequent detection
  of indolent malignancies on PSA screening. The detection of abnormal PSA levels
  typically is followed by ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. Therefore, in an effort
  to identify genetic markers that augment the information provided by standard histopathologic
  classification, the authors tested the feasibility of using these minute biopsy
  samples for genomic profiling via chromosome banding analysis and comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH .
