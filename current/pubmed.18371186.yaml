abstract: 'Gangliogliomas are generally benign neuroepithelial tumors composed of
  dysplastic neuronal and neoplastic glial elements. We screened 61 gangliogliomas
  World Health Organization WHO grade I for genomic alterations by chromosomal and
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Aberrations were detected in
  66 of gangliogliomas mean - SEM 2.5 - 0.5 alterations tumor . Frequent gains were
  on chromosomes 7 21 , 5 16 , 8 13 , 12 12 frequent losses on 22q 16 , 9 10 , 10
  8 . Recurrent partial imbalances comprised the minimal overlapping regions dim 10
  q25 and enh 12 q13.3-q14.1 . Unsupervised cluster analysis of genomic profiles detected
  two major subgroups group I: complete gain of 7 and additional gains of 5, 8 or
  12 group II: no major recurring imbalances, mainly losses . A comparison with low-grade
  gliomas astrocytomas WHO grade II showed chromosome 5 gain to be significantly more
  frequent in gangliogliomas. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH identified
  the aberrations to be contained in a subpopulation of glial but not in neuronal
  cells. Two gangliogliomas and their anaplastic recurrences WHO grade III were analyzed.
  Losses of CDKN2A B and DMBT1 or a gain amplification of CDK4 found in the anaplastic
  tumors were already present in the respective gangliogliomas by array CGH and interphase
  FISH. In summary, genomic profiling in a large series of gangliogliomas could distinguish
  genetic subgroups even in this low-grade tumor.'
