abstract: In the present study the clinical data, histology, proliferation rate, DNA
  ploidy status and the results of TP53 mutation analysis and comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH of three typical cases of desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and
  ganglioglioma are presented. Postoperative disease-free intervals of 11, 8 and 3
  years were recorded and in none of the cases were radiological signs of tumor recurrence.
  No TP53 mutations exons 5-8 were found. CGH analysis revealed loss of 8p22-pter
  in one case, while in another case gain of 13q21 was detected. In the case with
  the follow-up of 11 years an aneuploid DNA-flow cytogram along with slightly increased
  MIB-1 labeling index LI was found. The results demonstrate little genetic instability
  in these low-grade lesions. DNA-aneuploidy seems not to be indicative of tumor progression.
  It is concluded that the genetic aberrations found in desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma
  differ from those encountered in common astrocytomas.
