abstract: The majority of meningiomas are benign tumors associated with favorable
  outcomes however, the less common aggressive variants with unfavorable outcomes
  often recur and may be due to subpopulations of less-differentiated cells residing
  within the tumor. These subpopulations of tumor cells have tumor-initiating properties
  and may be isolated from heterogeneous tumors when sorted or cultured in defined
  medium. We report the isolation and characterization of a population of tumor-initiating
  cells derived from an atypical meningioma. We identify a tumor-initiating population
  from an atypical meningioma, termed meningioma-initiating cells MICs . These MICs
  self-renew, differentiate, and can recapitulate the histological characteristics
  of the parental tumor when transplanted at 1000 cells into the flank regions of
  athymic nude mice. Immunohistochemistry reveals stem-like protein expression patterns
  similar to neural stem and progenitor cells NSPCs while genomic profiling verified
  the isolation of cancer cells with defined meningioma chromosomal aberrations from
  the bulk tumor. Microarray and pathway analysis identifies biochemical processes
  and gene networks related to aberrant cell cycle progression, particularly the loss
  of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A p16 INK4A , p14 ARF , and CDKN2B
  p15 INK4B . Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of CD44 and activated
  leukocyte adhesion molecule ALCAM CD166 these may prove to be markers able to identify
  this cell type. The isolation and identification of a tumor-initiating cell population
  capable of forming meningiomas demonstrates a useful model for understanding meningioma
  development. This meningioma model may be used to study the cell hierarchy of meningioma
  tumorogenesis and provide increased understanding of malignant progression.
