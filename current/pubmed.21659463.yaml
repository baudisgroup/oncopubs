abstract: Pediatric glioblastoma pGBM , although rare, is one of the leading causes
  of cancer-related deaths in children, with tumors essentially refractory to existing
  treatments. We have identified IGF1R to be a potential therapeutic target in pGBM
  due to gene amplification and high levels of IGF2 expression in some tumor samples,
  as well as constitutive receptor activation in pGBM cell lines. To evaluate the
  therapeutic potential of strategies targeting the receptor, we have carried out
  in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies using the specific IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541.
  A modest inhibitory effect was seen in vitro, with GI 50 values of 5 to 6 mumol
  L, and concurrent inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. Specific targeting of
  IGF1R with short interfering RNA decreased cell viability, diminished downstream
  signaling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K , and induced G 1 arrest, effects
  mimicked by NVP-AEW541, both in the absence and presence of IGF2. Hallmarks of PI3K
  inhibition were observed after treatment with NVP-AEW541 by expression profiling
  and Western blot analysis. Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase RTK arrays showed phosphorylation
  of platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR alpha beta in pGBM cells, suggesting
  coactivation of an alternative RTK pathway. Treatment of KNS42 with the PDGFR inhibitor
  imatinib showed additional effects targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  pathway, and cotreatment of the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib with NVP-AEW541 resulted
  in a highly synergistic interaction in vitro and increased efficacy after 14 days
  therapy in vivo compared with either agent alone. These data provide evidence that
  inhibition of IGF1R, in combination with other targeted agents, may be a useful
  and novel therapeutic strategy in pGBM.
