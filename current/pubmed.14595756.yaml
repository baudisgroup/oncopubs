abstract: The application of comparative genomic hybridization CGH has led to the
  rapid accumulation of cytogenetic information on gastric carcinoma GC , but there
  is little information on the time sequence of cytogenetic changes. In the present
  study, degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR and CGH
  were applied to multiple samples microdissected from 19 diffuse-type GCs including
  eight early cancers. Recurrent gains were detected at 8q, 3q, 7q, and 8p, and loss
  at 17p in more than 50 of the cancers , the frequencies of which were fairly similar
  between the samples with SIG and those without POR abundant signet ring cells. Earlier
  stemline changes 8q , 8p , 1q , 17p-, etc , with breakpoints that were common to
  all the samples, were discriminated from later sideline changes 2q , 11q , 17q-,
  21q-, etc in individual tumours. The changes were generally common to early and
  advanced cancers, except for 7p , 15q , 3p-, and 18q-, which were largely sideline
  changes and more frequently detected in advanced cancers p amp lt 0.05 . Because
  the samples with 7p had a greater number of copy-number changes than those without
  7p p amp lt 0.01 , 7p may play a role in tumour progression by acceleration of chromosomal
  instability. Fifteen different chromosomal loci with amplification were detected
  in ten cases, mostly as sideline changes in advanced cancers. By microarray-based
  CGH, KRAS, MDM2, and FGFR2 were confirmed in the amplicons at 12p, 12q, and 10q,
  and FES at 15q26, for the first time in GC. These results support the notion that
  SIG and POR are of a genetically single lineage in both early and advanced diffuse-type
  GC and that the majority of advanced cancers derive from early cancers through the
  accumulation of various sideline changes in addition to stemline changes.
