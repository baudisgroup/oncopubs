abstract: 'Chordoid glioma of the third ventricle was recently reported as a novel
  tumor entity of the central nervous system with characteristic clinical and histopathological
  features Brat et al., J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 57: 283-290, 1998 . Here, we report
  on a histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analysis of five
  cases of this rare neoplasm. All tumors were immunohistochemically investigated
  for the expression of various differentiation antigens, the proliferation marker
  Ki-67, and a panel of selected proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products.
  These studies revealed a strong expression of GFAP, vimentin, and CD34. In addition,
  most tumors contained small fractions of neoplastic cells immunoreactive for epithelial
  membrane antigen, S-100 protein, or cytokeratins. The percentage of Ki-67 positive
  cells was generally low amp lt 5 . All tumors showed immunoreactivity for the epidermal
  growth factor receptor and schwannomin merlin. There was no nuclear accumulation
  of the p53, p21 Waf-1 and Mdm2 proteins. To examine genomic alterations associated
  with the development of chordoid gliomas, we screened 4 tumors by comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH analysis. No chromosomal imbalances were detected. More focussed
  molecular genetic analyses revealed neither aberrations of the TP53 and CDKN2A tumor
  suppressor genes nor amplification of the EGFR, CDK4, and MDM2 proto-oncogenes.
  Our data strongly support the hypothesis that chordoid glioma of the third ventricle
  constitutes a novel tumor entity characterized by distinct morphological and immunohistochemical
  features, as well as a lack of chromosomal and genetic alterations commonly found
  in other types of gliomas or in meningiomas.'
