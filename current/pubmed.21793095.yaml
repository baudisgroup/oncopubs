abstract: 'Well-differentiated liposarcoma WDLS is one of the most common malignant
  mesenchymal tumors and dedifferentiated liposarcoma DDLS is a malignant tumor consisting
  of both WDLS and a transformed nonlipogenic sarcomatous component. Cytogenetically,
  WDLS is characterized by the presence of ring or giant rod chromosomes containing
  several amplified genes, including MDM2, TSPAN31, CDK4, and others mainly derived
  from chromosome bands 12q13-15. However, the 12q13-15 amplicon is large and discontinuous.
  The focus of this study was to identify novel critical genes that are consistently
  amplified in primary nonrecurrent WDLS and with potential relevance for future targeted
  therapy. Using a high-resolution 5.0 kb amp quot single nucleotide polymorphism
  amp quot copy number variation microarray to screen the whole genome in a series
  of primary WDLS, two consistently amplified areas were found on chromosome 12: one
  region containing the MDM2 and CPM genes, and another region containing the FRS2
  gene. Based on these findings, we further validated FRS2 amplification in both WDLS
  and DDLS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed FRS2 amplification in all
  WDLS and DDLS tested n 57 . Real time PCR showed FRS2 mRNA transcriptional upregulation
  in WDLS n 19 and DDLS n 13 but not in lipoma n 5 and normal fat n 9 . Immunoblotting
  revealed high expression levels of phospho-FRS2 at Y436 and slightly overexpression
  of total FRS2 protein in liposarcoma but not in normal fat or preadipocytes. Considering
  the critical role of FRS2 in mediating fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling,
  our findings indicate that FRS2 signaling should be further investigated as a potential
  therapeutic target for liposarcoma.'
