abstract: In uveal melanoma, monosomy 3 is strongly associated with metastic disease
  and poor prognosis. Cytogenetic analysis and comparative genomic hybridization CGH
  have been used to identify chromosomal aberrations in uveal melanoma. As these methods
  are costly and time consuming in routine diagnostic settings, we evaluated whether
  tumors with monosomy 3 can be reliably identified by microsatellite analysis MSA
  . In addition, we also tested if aberrations of chromosomes 6 and 8, which have
  also been associated with the course of the disease, can be detected by MSA. We
  established a protocol for MSA of 23 markers, 3-4 on each arm of chromosomes 3,
  6, and 8. Twenty tumors were analyzed by CGH and MSA, and 10 tumors were analyzed
  by MSA only. For chromosome 3, the results of CGH and MSA were concordant, thus
  indicating that the dosage of this chromosome can reliably be determined by MSA.
  However, MSA failed to detect copy number gains at 6p in some tumors. Moreover,
  despite quantitative evaluation of allele ratios, it was not possible to discern
  8p losses and gains reliably. We thus conclude that while MSA can be used to determine
  monosomy 3 in uveal melanoma, careful interpretation of results for chromosomes
  6 and 8 is recommended.
