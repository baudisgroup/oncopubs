abstract: Following exposure to radiation during the Chernobyl fallout tragedy, papillary
  thyroid carcinoma PTC increased significantly in individuals who were children at
  the time of the accident. We have used two high-throughput, whole genome platforms
  to analyze radiation-induced PTCs from pediatric patients from the Chernobyl region.
