abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Renal epithelial tumors are morphologically, biologically,
  and clinically heterogeneous. Different morphologic subtypes require specific management
  due to markedly different prognosis and response to therapy. Each common subtype
  has characteristic chromosomal gains and losses, including some with prognostic
  value. However, copy number information has not been readily accessible for clinical
  purposes and thus has not been routinely used in the diagnostic evaluation of these
  tumors. This information can be useful for classification of tumors with complex
  or challenging morphology. ''Virtual karyotypes'' generated using SNP arrays can
  readily detect characteristic chromosomal lesions in paraffin embedded renal tumors
  and can be used to correctly categorize the common subtypes with performance characteristics
  that are amenable for routine clinical use. METHODS: To investigate the use of virtual
  karyotypes for diagnostically challenging renal epithelial tumors, we evaluated
  25 archived renal neoplasms where sub-classification could not be definitively rendered
  based on morphology and other ancillary studies. We generated virtual karyotypes
  with the Affymetrix 10 K 2.0 mapping array platform and identified the presence
  of genomic lesions across all 22 autosomes. RESULTS: In 91% of challenging cases
  the virtual karyotype unambiguously detected the presence or absence of chromosomal
  aberrations characteristic of one of the common subtypes of renal epithelial tumors,
  while immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization had no or limited
  utility in the diagnosis of these tumors. CONCLUSION: These results show that virtual
  karyotypes generated by SNP arrays can be used as a practical ancillary study for
  the classification of renal epithelial tumors with complex or ambiguous morphology.'
