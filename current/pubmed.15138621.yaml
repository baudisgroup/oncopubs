abstract: Renal cancer consists of a heterogeneous tumor group which is characterized
  by complex cytogenetic and molecular genetic abnormalities. In this study, three
  different techniques were applied to screen renal cancers for genetic alterations.
  We studied 99 primary, sporadic renal cancers 96 renal cell carcinomas and three
  other renal cancers by a comparative evaluation of different microsatellite markers,
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH and AP-PCR. The AP-PCR produces a genomic
  fingerprint after an AluEI DNA restriction digest of tumor DNA samples. Microsatellite
  alterations were investigated using nine microsatellite markers spanning well-known
  regions of FhiT and VHL 3p14.2, 3p26 but also of oncogenes and tumor suppressor
  genes like Myc-L1 and TP53Alu 1p32, 17p13.1 . To receive a genomic fingerprint,
  AP-PCR was carried out for all patient samples. Performing AP-PCR, only one case
  out of 99 displayed genomic imbalance. Seven of 99 investigated primary renal cancers
  showed alterations in up to four microsatellite loci TP53Alu, Myc-L1, D3S1300, D3S1560,
  D3S1317, D3S4260 . Three markers Bat25, Bat26, REN did not reveal any aberrations
  within the tested tumor samples. Six cases with microsatellite alterations and four
  without were examined by CGH. Five samples yielded aberrations, four of them were
  positive for microsatellite alterations. Only one tumor sample displayed microsatellite
  alterations, shift patterns in AP-PCR and alterations analyzed by CGH. Our data
  suggest that genomic aberrations found by microsatellite analysis are also detectable
  by CGH with the restriction of a minimum of alterated DNA of amp gt 10 Mb. Based
  on this study of RCC and in contrast to other reports for solid tumors, we conclude
  that AP-PCR is far less informative in investigation of renal cancers.
