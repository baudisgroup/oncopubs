abstract: In accordance with cancer progression, genomic aberrations accumulate in
  cancer cells in a stepwise fashion. However, whether there are genomic changes linked
  with tumour progression remains unclarified. The purpose of this study is to elucidate
  the relationship between genomic alterations and clinical stages in hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC . A technology of array-based CGH using DNA chips spotted with 1440
  BAC clones was applied to 42 surgically removed HCCs to examine the DNA copy number
  aberrations. A frequent copy number gain was detected on chromosomal regions 1q,
  8q and Xq. In particular, gains of 1q42.12, 1q43 and 8q24.3 were detected in more
  than 65 of tumours. A frequent copy number loss was detected on chromosomal regions
  1p, 4q, 6q, 8p and 17p. Losses of 8p21 and 17p13 were detected in more than 55 of
  HCCs. However, the DNA copy number gains of clones on 6p and 8q24.12 were more frequent
  in stage III IV tumours than in stage I II tumours p amp lt 0.001 . In particular,
  the gain of the whole 6p was virtually limited to advanced-staged HCCs. The gain
  of the whole 6p is suggested to be a genomic marker for the late stages in HCCs.
  These observations therefore support the concept of genomic staging in HCC.
