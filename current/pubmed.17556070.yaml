abstract: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma JNA is a rare benign tumor, mostly
  affecting adolescent males. Some patients develop recurrences after surgery independently
  of completeness of removal. Only very limited data concerning underlying chromosomal
  changes are available. We therefore analyzed samples of 22 JNAs, including six recurrences,
  with comparative genomic hybridization CGH . Additionally, quantitative image cytometry
  was used for measurement of DNA aneuploidy in representative samples. Of the 13
  primary JNAs without later recurrence, DNA gains were identified on autosomes in
  only two samples. Four patients with one or two recurrences were included in the
  study for one of these, no material of the primary tumor was available for analysis.
  Looking at autosomes, two of the three available primaries displayed multiple gains
  in one of those, two additional losses were observed. Multiple gains were detected
  in two of the four first recurrences, but none in the two second recurrences. Across
  all 22 samples, gains occurred in more than one sample on chromosomes arms 1p, 9q,
  10q, 12q, 16p, 16q, 17q, 19p, 19q, 20q, and 22q. Losses were found in a single case
  exclusively on chromosome 4. Sex chromosomes were frequently affected in both primary
  tumors and recurrences. There was no correlation among tumor staging, age, and DNA
  amplification. No DNA aneuploidy was detected, a finding in accordance with the
  generally benign characteristics of JNAs. Our observations suggest that in JNA the
  activation of oncogenes is more likely than the inactivation of tumor suppressor
  genes. Autosomal gains in the primary tumor should be further evaluated as markers
  for a potentially increased risk of recurrence after surgical removal in this entity.
