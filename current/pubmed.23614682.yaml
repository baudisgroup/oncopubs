abstract: Lenalidomide is an effective drug in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes
  (MDS) with isolated del(5q), although not all patients respond. Studies have suggested
  a role for TP53 mutations and karyotype complexity in disease progression and outcome.
  In order to assess the impact of complex karyotypes on treatment response and disease
  progression in 52 lenalidomide-treated patients with del(5q) MDS, conventional G-banding
  cytogenetics (CC), single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A), and genomic sequencing
  methods were used. SNP-A analysis (with control sample, lymphocytes CD3+, in 30
  cases) revealed 5q losses in all cases. Other recurrent abnormalities were infrequent
  and were not associated with lenalidomide responsiveness. Low karyotype complexity
  (by CC) and a high baseline platelet count (>280ï¿½× 10(9) /l) were associated with
  the achievement of haematological response (Pï¿½=ï¿½0ï¿½020, Pï¿½=ï¿½0ï¿½013 respectively).
  Unmutated TP53 status showed a tendency for haematological response (Pï¿½=ï¿½0ï¿½061).
  Complete cytogenetic response was not observed in any of the mutated TP53 cases.
  By multivariate analysis, the most important predictor for lenalidomide treatment
  failure was a platelet count <280ï¿½× 10(9) /l (Odds Ratioï¿½=ï¿½6ï¿½17, Pï¿½=ï¿½0ï¿½040).
  This study reveals the importance of a low baseline platelet count, karyotypic complexity
  and TP53 mutational status for response to lenalidomide treatment. It supports the
  molecular study of TP53 in MDS patients treated with lenalidomide.
