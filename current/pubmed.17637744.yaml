abstract: 'Human neuroblastoma remains enigmatic because it often shows spontaneous
  regression and aggressive growth. The prognosis of advanced stage of sporadic neuroblastomas
  is still poor. Here, we investigated whether genomic and molecular signatures could
  categorize new therapeutic risk groups in primary neuroblastomas. We conducted microarray-based
  comparative genomic hybridization array-CGH with a DNA chip carrying 2464 BAC clones
  to examine genomic aberrations of 236 neuroblastomas and used in-house cDNA microarrays
  for gene-expression profiling. Array-CGH demonstrated three major genomic groups
  of chromosomal aberrations: silent GGS , partial gains and or losses GGP and whole
  gains and or losses GGW , which well corresponded with the patterns of chromosome
  17 abnormalities. They were further classified into subgroups with different outcomes.
  In 112 sporadic neuroblastomas, MYCN amplification was frequent in GGS 22 and GGP
  53 and caused serious outcomes in patients. Sporadic tumors with a single copy of
  MYCN showed the 5-year cumulative survival rates of 89 in GGS, 53 in GGP and 85
  in GGW. Molecular signatures also segregated patients into the favorable and unfavorable
  prognosis groups P 0.001 . Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that
  genomic and molecular signatures were mutually independent, powerful prognostic
  indicators. Thus, combined genomic and molecular signatures may categorize novel
  risk groups and confer new clues for allowing tailored or even individualized medicine
  to patients with neuroblastoma.'
