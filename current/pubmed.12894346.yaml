abstract: Genetic instability resulting in chromosome aneuploidy or mismatch repair
  deficiency characterizes cancer. Medullary carcinoma MC of the breast is a specific
  form of breast cancer with unique clinical, epidemiologic, and prognostic features,
  suggesting distinctive tumorigenic pathways. To investigate the nature of the genetic
  changes associated with MC we analyzed a series of 22 tumors. Chromosomal imbalances
  were assessed by comparative genomic hybridization CGH and mismatch repair MMR deficiency
  tested for through assessment of microsatellite instability MSI and expression of
  MLH1 and MSH2 genes. MMR deficiency was detected in only a small proportion of cases.
  The chromosomal copy number changes showed some similarities to BRCA1-associated
  tumors. A high level of BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was detected, suggesting
  a possible role of this gene in MC development.
