abstract: It is important to estimate the biological characteristics of tumors, including
  the nodal status at the time of diagnosis for optimal treatment of individual cancer
  patients. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH was performed on 77
  sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas using a chip spotted with 4030 BAC clones. The
  nodal status was compared with an aCGH profiles depicted using a combination of
  decision-tree classifier and a Self-Organizing Map SOM analysis. Node metastasis
  was not detected in any of the 6 poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with a 3q
  loss. A SOM analysis following the decision-tree classification of the aCGH data
  allowed for the differentiation in chromosomal regions between high- and low-level
  decreases in the DNA copy number. Node metastasis was detected in all 5 tumors with
  the high-level decrease in DNA copy number at Xp, irrespective of the histological
  type. Node metastasis was also found exclusively in 6 tumors with increase in DNA
  copy number at the chromosomal region between 11q13.3 and 11q22.3. Copy number aberrations
  linked to nodal metastasis were identified more collectively by the combination
  of the decision-tree classifier and a SOM analysis than by the conventional analysis
  method in aCGH analysis.
