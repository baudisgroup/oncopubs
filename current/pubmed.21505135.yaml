abstract: 'The identification of patients with inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes
  facilitates early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. However, in many cases of
  suspected cancer susceptibility, the family history is unclear and genetic testing
  of common cancer susceptibility genes is unrevealing.  To apply whole-genome sequencing
  to a patient without any significant family history of cancer but with suspected
  increased cancer susceptibility because of multiple primary tumors to identify rare
  or novel germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
  PARTICIPANT: Skin (normal) and bone marrow (leukemia) DNA were obtained from a patient
  with early-onset breast and ovarian cancer (negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations)
  and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and analyzed with the following:
  whole-genome sequencing using paired-end reads, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
  genotyping, RNA expression profiling, and spectral karyotyping.  Structural variants,
  copy number alterations, single-nucleotide variants, and small insertions and deletions
  (indels) were detected and validated using the described platforms. RESULTS; Whole-genome
  sequencing revealed a novel, heterozygous 3-kilobase deletion removing exons 7-9
  of TP53 in the patient''s normal skin DNA, which was homozygous in the leukemia
  DNA as a result of uniparental disomy. In addition, a total of 28 validated somatic
  single-nucleotide variations or indels in coding genes, 8 somatic structural variants,
  and 12 somatic copy number alterations were detected in the patient''s leukemia
  genome.  Whole-genome sequencing can identify novel, cryptic variants in cancer
  susceptibility genes in addition to providing unbiased information on the spectrum
  of mutations in a cancer genome.'
