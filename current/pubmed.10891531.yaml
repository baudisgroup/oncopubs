abstract: 'To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human esophageal cancer, we
  performed a comparative genomic hybridization CGH analysis using 10 esophageal squamous
  cell carcinomas. Frequent gains of 1q, 3q, 7p, 7q, 8q, 11q, and 20q and losses of
  3p, 4p, 4q, 5q, 9p, 11p, 11q, 13q, 18q, 21q, and Y were observed. Among these regions,
  21q has not yet been investigated in detail. We performed an allelotype study using
  55 squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus and 20 microsatellite markers on 21q
  and found LOH in 36 cases 65 : 22 61 of 36 cases with LOH indicated allelic loss
  in all informative loci, suggesting loss of the whole chromosome arm 21q, and five
  smallest regions of overlap were found. Our present results suggest the existence
  of a tumor suppressor gene s that plays a role in the genesis of squamous cell carcinoma
  of the esophagus.'
