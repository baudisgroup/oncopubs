abstract: Recent high-throughput sequencing and microarray studies have characterized
  the genetic landscape and clonal complexity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
  Here, we performed a longitudinal study in a homogeneously treated cohort of 12
  patients, with sequential samples obtained at comparable stages of disease. We identified
  clonal competition between 2 or more genetic subclones in 70% of the patients with
  relapse, and stable clonal dynamics in the remaining 30%. By deep sequencing, we
  identified a high reservoir of genetic heterogeneity in the form of several driver
  genes mutated in small subclones underlying the disease course. Furthermore, in
  2 patients, we identified convergent evolution, characterized by the combination
  of genetic lesions affecting the same genes or copy number abnormality in different
  subclones. The phenomenon affects multiple CLL putative driver abnormalities, including
  mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, DDX3X, and del(11q23). This is the first report documenting
  convergent evolution as a recurrent event in the CLL genome. Furthermore, this finding
  suggests the selective advantage of specific combinations of genetic lesions for
  CLL pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
