abstract: The transcription factor E2A is essential for lymphocyte development. In
  this study, we describe a recurrent E2A gene deletion in at least 70% of patients
  with Sï¿½zary syndrome (SS), a subtype of T cell lymphoma. Loss of E2A results in
  enhanced proliferation and cell cycle progression via derepression of the protooncogene
  MYC and the cell cycle regulator CDK6. Furthermore, by examining the gene expression
  profile of SS cells after restoration of E2A expression, we identify several E2A-regulated
  genes that interfere with oncogenic signaling pathways, including the Ras pathway.
  Several of these genes are down-regulated or lost in primary SS tumor cells. These
  data demonstrate a tumor suppressor function of E2A in human lymphoid cells and
  could help to develop new treatment strategies for human lymphomas with altered
  E2A activity.
