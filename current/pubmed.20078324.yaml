abstract: 'Array-based comparative genomic hybridization arrayCGH studies in chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia CLL have revealed novel recurrent chromosomal imbalances, such
  as a gain of chromosome 2p. However, a detailed cytogenetic analysis of the 2p gain
  region has not been elucidated. Here, we present cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic
  analysis of 16 such cases selected from a group of 200 patients with CLL based on
  CGH and or arrayCGH data. We revealed significant heterogeneity of the region of
  gain on 2p in CLL, including a new recurrent aberration: the dicentric chromosome,
  dic 2 18 . In our cases, the region of gain involved three genes MYCN, REL, and
  ALK and was associated with an unmutated IgVH status in 14 out of 16 cases. We consider
  this aberration clinically important in CLL and suggest that an examination of the
  gene s located in region of gain should be included in the routine fluorescence
  in situ hybridization screening method used for patients with CLL.'
