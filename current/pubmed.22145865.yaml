abstract: The purpose of the present study was to determine the genomic profile of
  renal cell carcinoma RCC in end-stage renal disease ESRD by analyzing genomic copy
  number aberrations. Seventy-nine tumor samples from 63 patients with RCC-ESRD were
  analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization using the Agilent Whole Human
  Genome 4 44K Oligo Micro Array Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA . Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the 63 cases could be divided into
  two groups, Clusters A and B. Cluster A was comprised mainly of clear cell RCC CCRCC
  , whereas Cluster B was comprised mainly of papillary RCC PRCC , acquired cystic
  disease ACD -associated RCC, and clear cell papillary RCC. Analysis of the averaged
  frequencies revealed that the genomic profiles of Clusters A and B resembled those
  of sporadic CCRCC and sporadic PRCC, respectively. Although it has been proposed
  on the basis of histopathology that ACD-associated RCC, clear cell papillary RCC
  and PRCC-ESRD are distinct subtypes, the present data reveal that the genomic profiles
  of these types, categorized as Cluster B, resemble one another. Furthermore, the
  genomic profiles of PRCC, ACD-associated RCC and clear cell papillary RCC admixed
  in one tissue tended to resemble one another. On the basis of genomic profiling
  of RCC-ESRD, we conclude that the molecular pathogenesis of CCRCC-ESRD resembles
  that of sporadic CCRCC. Although various histologic subtypes of non-clear cell RCC-ESRD
  have been proposed, their genomic profiles resemble those of sporadic PRCC, suggesting
  that the molecular pathogenesis of non-CCRCC-ESRD may be related to that of sporadic
  PRCC.
