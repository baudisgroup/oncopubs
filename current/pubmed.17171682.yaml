abstract: 'To investigate the patterns of genetic lesions in a panel of 23 human multiple
  myeloma cell lines HMCLs , we made a genomic integrative analysis involving FISH,
  and both gene expression and genome-wide profiling approaches. The expression profiles
  of the genes targeted by the main IGH translocations showed that the WHSC1 MMSET
  gene involved in t 4 14 p16 q32 was expressed at different levels in all of the
  HMCLs, and that the expression of the MAF gene was not restricted to the HMCLs carrying
  t 14 16 q32 q23 . Supervised analyses identified a limited number of genes specifically
  associated with t 4 14 and involved in different biological processes. The signature
  related to MAF MAFB expression included the known MAF target genes CCND2 and ITGB7,
  as well as genes controlling cell shape and cell adhesion. Genome-wide DNA profiling
  allowed the identification of a gain on chromosome arm 1q in 88 of the analyzed
  cell lines, together with recurrent gains on 8q, 18q, 7q, and 20q the most frequent
  deletions affected 1p, 13q, 17p, and 14q and almost all of the cell lines presented
  LOH on chromosome 13. Two hundred and twenty-two genes were found to be simultaneously
  overexpressed and amplified in our panel, including the BCL2 locus at 18q21.33.
  Our data further support the evidence of the genomic complexity of multiple myeloma
  and reinforce the role of an integrated genomic approach in improving our understanding
  of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. This article contains Supplementary
