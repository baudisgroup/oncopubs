abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate additional genetic alterations in
  papillary thyroid carcinomas PTCs with known RET PTC rearrangements. We applied
  array-based comparative genomic hybridization array CGH to 33 PTC 20 PTC from adults,
  13 post-Chernobyl PTC from children with known RET PTC status. Principal component
  analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis identified cases with similar aberration
  patterns. Significant deviations between tumour-groups were obtained by statistical
  testing Fishers exact test in combination with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-controlling
  procedure . FISH analysis on FFPE sections was applied to validate the array CGH
  data. Deletions were found more frequently in RET PTC-positive and RET PTC-negative
  tumours than amplifications. Specific aberration signatures were identified that
  discriminated between RET PTC-positive and RET PTC-negative cases aberrations on
  chromosomes 1p, 3q, 4p, 7p, 9p q, 10q, 12q, 13q and 21q . In addition, childhood
  and adult RET PTC-positive cases differ significantly for a deletion on the distal
  part of chromosome 1p. There are additional alterations in RET PTC-positive tumours,
  which may act as modifiers of RET activation. In contrast, alterations in RET PTC-negative
  tumours indicate alternative routes of tumour development. The data presented serve
  as a starting point for further studies on gene expression and function of genes
  identified in this study.
