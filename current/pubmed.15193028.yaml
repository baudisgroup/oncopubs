abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to screen 22 esthesioneuroblastomas
  ENB from 12 patients including 12 primary tumors and 10 metastasis recurrent lesions
  for chromosomal imbalances being the most extensive study so far. The analysis revealed
  a characteristic pattern consisting of deletions on chromosomes 3p and overrepresentations
  on 17q in up to 100 of cases. Other important alterations being detectable in more
  than 80 of cases were deletions on 1p, 3p q, 9p, 10p q along with overrepresentation
  on 17p13, 20p and 22q. Particularly striking was the pattern for chromosomes 3,
  10 and 17q and 20 being affected almost exclusively by deletions or overrepresentations,
  respectively. Pronounced overrepresentations suggestive for high copy amplifications
  were seen on 1p34, 1q23-q31, 7p21, 7q31, 9p23-p24, 17q11-q22, 17q24-q25, 19, 20p,
  20q13 and 22q13. Comparing tumor pairs from the same patient revealed a high concordance
  indicating clonality and confirming the genetic homogeneity of the tumor entity.
  The analysis of metastatic recurrent lesions indicated a higher percentage of pronounced
  alterations, e.g., high copy DNA gains at 1q34-qter, 7q11, 9p23-p24, 9q34, 13q33-q34,
  16p13.3, 16p11, 16q23-q24 and 17p13. The analysis furthermore suggested specific
  alterations, e.g., deletions of chromosome 11 and gains of 1p to be associated with
  metastasis formation and or worse prognosis. Our results indicate that ENB is a
  distinct entity and provides criteria for its genetic distinction from other small
  round cell tumor types.
