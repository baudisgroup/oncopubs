abstract: The pathogenetic relation between liver cell dysplasia and hepatocellular
  carcinoma HCC is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether
  there is a genetic link between liver cell dysplasia and HCC that could support
  the role of dysplasia as a tumour precursor lesion.
