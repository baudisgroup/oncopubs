abstract: Gastric cancer samples obtained by histologic macrodissection contain a
  relatively high stromal content that may significantly influence gene expression
  profiles. Differences between the gene expression signature derived from macrodissected
  gastric cancer samples and the signature obtained from isolated gastric cancer epithelial
  cells from the same biopsies using laser-capture microdissection LCM were evaluated
  for their potential experimental biases.
