abstract: Renal cell carcinoma RCC is an aggressive malignancy with limited responsiveness
  to existing treatments. In vivo models of human cancer, including RCC, are critical
  for developing more effective therapies. Unfortunately, current RCC models do not
  accurately represent relevant properties of the human disease. The goal of this
  study was to develop clinically relevant animal models of RCC for preclinical investigations.
  We transplanted intact human tumour tissue fragments orthotopically in immunodeficient
  mice. The xenografts were validated by comparing the morphological, phenotypic and
  genetic characteristics of the kidney tumour tissues before and after implantation.
  Twenty kidney tumours were transplanted into mice. Successful tumour growth was
  detected in 19 cases 95 . The histopathological and immunophenotypic features of
  the xenografts and those of the original tumours largely overlapped in all cases.
  Evaluation of genetic alterations in a subset of 10 cases demonstrated that the
  grafts largely retained the genetic features of the pre-implantation RCC tissues.
  Indeed, primary tumours and corresponding grafts displayed identical VHL mutations.
  Moreover, an identical pattern of DNA copy amplification or loss was observed in
  6 10 cases 60 . In summary, orthotopic engrafting of RCC tissue fragments can be
  successfully used to generate animal models that closely resemble RCC in patients.
  These models will be invaluable for in vivo preclinical drug testing and for deeper
  understanding of kidney carcinogenesis. The raw data of the SNP array analysis has
  been submitted to the GEO database Accession No. GSE29062 .
