abstract: The accurate assessment of disease risk remains a major goal in children
  with medulloblastoma. Activation of the canonical Wnt Wingless Wnt Wg signalling
  pathway occurs in up to 25 of cases and is associated with a favorable disease outcome.
  To explore the molecular pathogenesis of Wnt Wg-active medulloblastomas, and to
  investigate any genetic basis for their observed clinical behavior, we assessed
  a series of primary medulloblastomas for evidence of Wnt Wg pathway activation,
  alongside a genome-wide analysis of associated copy-number aberrations. Cases displaying
  evidence of Wnt Wg activation CTNNB1 mutation and or beta-catenin nuclear stabilisation
  were exclusively associated with a distinct genomic signature involving loss of
  an entire copy of chromosome 6 but few other aberrations p amp lt 0.001 . In contrast,
  Wnt Wg-negative tumors coclustered into an unrelated sub-group characterised by
  multiple established genomic defects common in medulloblastoma losses of chromosomes
  17p, 8, 10 and 16 gains of chromosomes 7 and 17q . Further investigation of specific
  genetic defects in a larger independent cohort demonstrated that loss of chromosome
  6 was exclusively observed in Wnt Wg-active tumors, but not in Wnt Wg-negative cases
  8 13 vs. 0 19 p 0.0001 , while pathway activation was independent of chromosome
  17 aberrations, the most common chromosomal alterations detected in medulloblastoma
  p 0.005 . Wnt Wg-active tumors could not be distinguished on the basis of clinical
  or pathological disease features. Our data indicate that Wnt Wg-active tumors represent
  an independent molecular sub-group of medulloblastomas characterised by a distinct
  pattern of genomic aberrations. These findings provide a strong biological basis
  to support 1 the idiosyncratic clinical behavior of Wnt Wg-active medulloblastomas,
  and 2 the development of beta-catenin status as an independent marker for therapeutic
  stratification in this disease.
