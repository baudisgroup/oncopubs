abstract: 'Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-death among women, where the
  clinicopathological features of tumors are used to prognosticate and guide therapy.
  DNA copy number alterations CNAs , which occur frequently in breast cancer and define
  key pathogenetic events, are also potentially useful prognostic or predictive factors.
  Here, we report a genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization array
  CGH survey of CNAs in 89 breast tumors from a patient cohort with locally advanced
  disease. Statistical analysis links distinct cytoband loci harboring CNAs to specific
  clinicopathological parameters, including tumor grade, estrogen receptor status,
  presence of TP53 mutation, and overall survival. Notably, distinct spectra of CNAs
  also underlie the different subtypes of breast cancer recently defined by expression-profiling,
  implying these subtypes develop along distinct genetic pathways. In addition, higher
  numbers of gains losses are associated with the amp quot basal-like amp quot tumor
  subtype, while high-level DNA amplification is more frequent in amp quot luminal-B
  amp quot subtype tumors, suggesting also that distinct mechanisms of genomic instability
  might underlie their pathogenesis. The identified CNAs may provide a basis for improved
  patient prognostication, as well as a starting point to define important genes to
  further our understanding of the pathobiology of breast cancer. This article contains
