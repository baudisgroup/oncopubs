abstract: Aggressive neuroblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge, and additional
  understanding of its biology is of paramount importance. Changes in DNA-copy number
  were analysed in the neuroblastoma cells of 27 patients using comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . Eighteen of the patients had a poor risk disease 16 18 stage
  IV and 9 had a non-poor-risk disease 3 9 stage I-II, 2 9 stage III, and 4 9 stage
  IVS . Changes in DNA-copy number were detected in 72 of the poor-risk and 22 of
  the non-poor-risk tumors with gains of chromosomal material being more prevalent
  than losses. Gains were most common in chromosomes 2, 7, and 17 and losses in chromosome
  11. Changes in DNA-copy number were multiple in all but one of the patients with
  poor-risk disease. The applicability of CGH in studies on the genomic changes in
  pediatric malignancies is demonstrated by our data also adding weight to the argument
  of multiple elements with oncogenic and or tumor suppressor potential being involved
  in the aggressive phenotype of poor-risk neuroblastoma.
