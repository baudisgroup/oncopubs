abstract: Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH provides a method to quantitatively
  measure the changes of DNA copy number with an extremely high resolution and to
  map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. In this study, we used
  aCGH to compare genomic alterations in fresh-frozen lung cancer tissues of 21 adenocarcinomas
  AdCCs 11 early relapse and 10 nonrelapse and identified genomic alterations that
  showed significant by different frequency between early relapse and nonrelapse AdCCs.
  Twelve clones were identified by the false discovery rate FDR test, and Kaplan-Meier
  analyses were selected as predictive markers. The significant gain clones were found
  in 11p 11p15.4, 11p15.1, and 11p13 . When the cutoff value was 2, study of the association
  between candidate clones and relapse prediction revealed that early relapse and
  nonrelapse groups were most effectively separated. To further validate the gain
  of chromosome 11p region that was identified by array CGH, fluorescence in situ
  hybridization FISH was performed. To further confirm the results of aCGH, copy number
  changes of cancer-related candidate genes in AdCC patients were compared by real-time
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Array CGH and real-time quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction data were found to correspond to delineated DNA copy number changes.
  Genomic alterations of chromosome 11p region in AdCC patients were observed with
  aCGH, and a relapsable marker was identified in the nonrelapse group. This marker
  could be useful in stratifying patient groups according to likelihood of relapse
  for adjuvant treatment after surgical resection.
