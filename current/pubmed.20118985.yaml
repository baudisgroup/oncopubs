abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib
  and erlotinib are effective therapies against mutant non-small cell lung cancers
  NSCLCs . Treatment is limited by the development of resistance in part explained
  by the gain of a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, at the gatekeeper residue. Irreversible
  EGFR inhibitors, including PF00299804, are effective in vitro and in vivo against
  EGFR mutant tumors that contain EGFR T790M and are currently under clinical development.
  In this study, we generate models of resistance to PF00299804, using cell lines
  with EGFR T790M and show that the PF00299804-resistant models develop focal amplification
  of EGFR that preferentially involves the T790M-containing allele. These PF00299804-resistant
  cell lines remain dependent on EGFR for growth as downregulation of EGFR by shRNA
  compromises their viability. We show that resistance to PF00299804 arises, at least
  in part, through selection of a pre-existing EGFR T790M-amplified clone both in
  vitro and using a xenograft model in vivo. Our findings show that EGFR T790M is
  a common resistance mechanism to both reversible, and when amplified, the irreversible
  EGFR kinase inhibitors further emphasizing the need to develop more potent therapies
  against EGFR T790M. These findings can be used to guide studies of patient tumor
  specimens from ongoing clinical trials of irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors.
