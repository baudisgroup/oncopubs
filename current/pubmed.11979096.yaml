abstract: 'This report describes 22 Spitz nevi that seemed to have been clinically
  removed but persisted and clinically recurred at the biopsy site. These were evaluated
  in terms of histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular pathology using
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH and fluorescent in situ hybridization. One
  of these 22 lesions was originally reported as an atypical melanocytic proliferation
  with some features of a Spitz nevus and was included in the study set at an early
  stage but was later recognized as melanoma after metastasis to regional lymph nodes
  3 years after the local recurrence. We noted four histopathologic patterns in the
  recurrent lesions: 1 a predominantly intraepidermal pattern resembling amp quot
  pseudomelanoma amp quot as seen in recurrent amp quot common amp quot melanocytic
  nevi, 2 a compound, mostly nested pattern above or within a scar that was nearly
  identical to the originally biopsied Spitz nevus, 3 a nodular growth pattern that
  closely simulated invasive melanoma, and 4 a desmoplastic pattern resembling an
  intradermal desmoplastic Spitz nevus. Although the majority of recurrent lesions
  exhibited asymmetry and pagetoid spread, the dermal component usually had a low
  mitotic rate and retained architectural and cytologic maturation, which allowed
  distinction from invasive melanoma. Except for the metastasizing melanoma, the immunostaining
  pattern with S-100 and HMB-45 was identical to that previously reported for Spitz
  nevi. Ki67 revealed a very low proliferation rate in all cases, including the melanoma.
  CGH performed in 10 cases yielded results consistent with Spitz nevi in eight cases.
  The remaining two cases showed CGH profiles more typical of melanoma, and one of
  these was the above-referenced case of melanoma, proven by metastasis. Although
  ancillary molecular techniques such as CGH are of great help in distinguishing these
  from melanoma, until such techniques become widely available we advocate complete
  but conservative excision of any recurrent Spitz nevus.'
