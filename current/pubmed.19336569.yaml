abstract: We have analyzed the DNA copy numbers for over 100,000 single-nucleotide
  polymorphism loci across the human genome in genomic DNA from 313 lymph node-negative
  primary breast tumors for which genome-wide gene expression data were also available.
  Combining these two data sets allowed us to identify the genomic loci and their
  mapped genes, having high correlation with distant metastasis. An estimation of
  the likely response based on published predictive signatures was performed in the
  identified prognostic subgroups defined by gene expression and DNA copy number data.
  In the training set of 200 patients, we constructed an 81-gene prognostic copy number
  signature CNS that identified a subgroup of patients with increased probability
  of distant metastasis in the independent validation set of 113 patients hazard ratio
  HR , 2.8 95 confidence interval 95 CI , 1.4-5.6 and in an external data set of 116
  patients HR, 3.7 95 CI, 1.3-10.6 . These high-risk patients constituted a subset
  of the high-risk patients predicted by our previously established 76-gene gene expression
  signature GES . This very poor prognostic group identified by CNS and GES was putatively
  more resistant to preoperative paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide
  combination chemotherapy P 0.0048 , particularly against the doxorubicin compound,
  while potentially benefiting from etoposide. Our study shows the feasibility of
  using copy number alterations to predict patient prognostic outcome. When combined
  with gene expression-based signatures for prognosis, the CNS refines risk classification
  and can help identify those breast cancer patients who have a significantly worse
  outlook in prognosis and a potential differential response to chemotherapeutic drugs.
