abstract: RON MST1R is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family,
  along with parent receptor MET. RON has a putative role in several cancers, but
  its expression and function is poorly characterized in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
  A recognized functional role of MET tyrosine kinase in gastroesophageal cancer has
  led to early phase clinical trials using MET inhibitors, with unimpressive results.
  Therefore, the role of RON in gastroesophageal cancer, as well as its role in cooperative
  signaling with MET and as a mechanism of resistance to MET inhibition, was studied
  in gastroesophageal tissues and cell lines. By IHC, RON was highly over-expressed
  in 74 of gastroesophageal samples n 94 , and over-expression was prognostic of poor
  survival p 0.008 RON and MET co-expression occurred in 43 of samples and was prognostic
  of worst survival p 0.03 . High MST1R gene copy number by quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction, and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and or array
  comparative genomic hybridization, was seen in 35.5 16 45 of cases. High MST1R gene
  copy number correlated with poor survival p 0.01 , and was associated with high
  MET and ERBB2 gene copy number. A novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation R1018G
  was found in 11 of samples. RON signaling was functional in cell lines, activating
  downstream effector STAT3, and resulted in increased viability over controls. RON
  and MET co-stimulation assays led to enhanced malignant phenotypes over stimulation
  of either receptor alone. Growth inhibition as evidenced by viability and apoptosis
  assays was optimal using novel blocking monoclonal antibodies to both RON and MET,
  versus either alone. SU11274, a classic MET small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
  blocked signaling of both receptors, and proved synergistic when combined with STAT3
  inhibition combination index amp lt 1 . These preclinical studies define RON as
  an important novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for gastroesophageal
  cancer warranting further investigation.
