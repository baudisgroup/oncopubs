abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor GIST is the most common mesenchymal tumor
  of the gastrointestinal tract. The tumors characteristically harbor KIT or PDGFRA
  mutations, and mutant tumors respond to imatinib mesylate Glivectrade mark . Chromosomal
  imbalances resulting in altered gene dosage are known to have a role in the molecular
  pathogenesis of these tumors, but the target genes remain to be identified. The
  present study aimed to identify some of these genes. In total, 35 GIST samples were
  screened for chromosomal imbalances by array-based comparative genomic hybridization.
  A cDNA array was used to define the minimal common overlapping areas of DNA copy
  number change. Eight confirmative, replicate hybridizations were performed using
  an oligonucleotide array. The most recurrent copy number losses were localized to
  14q, 22q, and 1p. Gains were less common with 8q being the most recurrent. Two recurrent
  deleted regions of 14q were 14q11.2 harboring the PARP2, APEX1, and NDRG2 genes
  and 14q32.33 harboring SIVA. Additional target candidates were NF2 at chromosome
  22, CDKN2A 2B at 9p, and ENO1 at 1p for copy number losses, and MYC at 8q for copy
  number gains. Array CGH proved to be an effective tool for the identification of
  chromosome regions involved in the development and progression of GISTs.

notes: All 35 tumors were analyzed with 16k cDNA arrays. In 8 tumors with 14q changes,
  hybridizations were redone with 44k Agilent oligo-arrays. For some of the cases,
  CGH data was available from another study (PMID 10919666); those cases were only
  reported here, to avoid duplication of results in the database.
