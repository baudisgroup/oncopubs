abstract: Gastric adenocarcinoma is a serious public health concern, especially in
  northern Brazil. Gastric cancer can be subdivided into diffuse and intestinal types.
  Genetic imbalances in diffuse-type gastric cancer remain largely unknown. In the
  present study, we analyzed 24 advanced diffuse-type gastric cancer samples from
  northern Brazil subjects using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization.
  We found chromosomal alterations in 75 of samples. In cancers with aneusomies, the
  mean genomic copy number alteration was 6.4. Losses of chromosome regions exceeded
  gains. The most frequent losses were located at chromosome regions 11q and 18q five
  samples for each region , 1pq, 3q, 4q, 5q, 13q, and 14q four samples , followed
  by 2pq, 7p, 9pq, 11p, and 16p three samples . Our results confirm that gastric cancer
  has a complex pattern of chromosomal alterations that can be due to general chromosomal
  instability related to the advanced stage of gastric carcinogenesis. Loss of 11q
  and 18q were the most frequent chromosomal changes in diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma
  in individuals from northern Brazil. Frequent loss of 11q chromosome region in this
  gastric cancer may be peculiar among this population.
