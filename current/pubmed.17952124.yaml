abstract: 'Ewings sarcoma ES is characterized by specific chromosome translocations,
  the most common being t 11 22 q24 q12 . Additionally, other type of genetic abnormalities
  may occur and be relevant for explaining the variable tumour biology and clinical
  outcome. We have carried out a high-resolution array CGH and expression profiling
  on 25 ES tumour samples to characterize the DNA copy number aberrations CNA occurring
  in these tumours and determine their association with gene-expression profiles and
  clinical outcome. CNA were observed in 84 of the cases. We observed a median number
  of three aberrations per case. Besides numerical chromosome changes, smaller aberrations
  were found and defined at chromosomes 5p, 7q and 9p. All CNA were compiled to define
  the smallest overlapping regions of imbalance SORI . A total of 35 SORI were delimited.
  Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify subgroups according to the pattern
  of genomic instability. Unsupervised and supervised clustering analysis using SORI
  as variables segregated the tumours in two distinct groups: one genomically stable
  amp lt or 3 CNA and other genomically unstable amp gt 3 CNA . The genomic unstable
  group showed a statistically significant shorter overall survival and was more refractory
  to chemotherapy. Expression profile analysis revealed significant differences between
  both groups. Genes related with chromosome segregation, DNA repair pathways and
  cell-cycle control were upregulated in the genomically unstable group. This report
  elucidates, for the first time, data about genomic instability in ES, based on CNA
  and expression profiling, and shows that a genomically unstable group of Ewings
  tumours is correlated with a significant poor prognosis.'
