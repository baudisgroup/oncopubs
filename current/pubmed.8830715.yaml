abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to analyze seven autologous
  uveal melanomas with both formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen specimens.
  In addition, DNA from two archival formalin-fixed tumors more than 45 years old
  were also analyzed. The most frequent genetic changes were loss of chromosome 3
  increase in copy number of 6p and loss of 6q and increase in copy number of 8q.
  A comparison of CGH data from the fresh-frozen tumors and their autologous formalin-fixed
  tumors revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.83. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH analysis of 45-year-old specimens identified genetic changes similar to those
  found in more recent tumors including loss of chromosome 3 and increase in copy
  numbers of 6p and 8q. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between
  data obtained from formalin-fixed and fresh-frozen specimens using CGH. Furthermore,
  the results demonstrate the applicability of this technique in analyzing archival
  formalin-fixed tumors that were previously not accessible to cytogenetic analysis.
