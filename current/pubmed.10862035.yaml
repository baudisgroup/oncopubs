abstract: 'Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma PAC is a rare pancreatic tumor for which
  no information about chromosomal anomalies is available. We examined six primary
  PACs by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . All cases showed chromosomal changes.
  A total of 106 gains and 48 losses was detected. Consensus regions of gain were
  identified on chromosomes 1, 12, and X: 1q21 in four cases, 1q42 in three cases,
  12p11.2 in four cases, and Xq12-21 in three cases. Recurrent losses were found at
  16p13.2-p13.1 in three cases and at 16q23 in three cases. To verify these chromosomal
  imbalances, microsatellite analysis of matched normal and tumor DNA was performed
  using PCR-amplified markers for chromosomes 1, 12, and 16 in the regions showing
  nonrandom gains or losses. This analysis showed allelic imbalances in tumor DNA
  consistent with the CGH profiles. Our CGH study suggests that PAC shows a characteristic
  pattern of chromosomal alterations, involving gain at 1q, 12p, and Xq and loss of
  sequences at 16p and 16q. This pattern appears unique among solid tumors and is
  markedly different from that detected in pancreatic ductal carcinomas by the same
  technique. This suggests that PAC tumorigenesis involves different molecular pathways
  than those involved in the more common pancreatic ductal tumors. Genes Chromosomes
