abstract: The goal of this study was to identify recurrent regions of genomic gain
  or loss in endometrial cancer of the endometrioid type in the context of racial
  disparities in mortality for this disease. Array comparative genomic hybridization
  aCGH analysis was performed on 80 frozen primary tumors from the Gynecologic Oncology
  Group GOG -210 bank using the RPCI 19K BAC arrays. The 80 patients included 20 African
  American AA Stage I, 20 White W Stage I, 20 African American AA Stage IIIC IV, and
  20 White W Stage IIIC IV. A separate subset of 220 endometrial cancers with outcome
  data was used for validation. A 1.6-Mbp region of gain at 1q23 was identified by
  aCGH in all AA patients and high grade W patients, but not W low grade patients.
  In the validation arm of 220 patients copy number gain at this region was validated
  using FISH and locus specific BACs. The number of AA patients in the validation
  arm was too small to confirm the aCGH association with racial disparity. Kaplan-Meier
  curves for survival showed a significant difference for gain at 1q23 versus no gain
  log rank P 0.0014 . When subdivided into various groups of risk by stage and grade
  the survival curves showed a decreased survival for high grade and or stage tumors,
  but not for low grade and or stage endometrioid tumors. Univariate analyses for
  gain at 1q23 showed a significant association P 0.009 with survival. Multivariate
  analysis for gain at 1q23 did not show a significant association with survival P
  0.14 .
