abstract: Eleven uveal melanomas were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . The most abundant genetic changes were loss of chromosome 3, overrepresentation
  of 6p, loss of 6q, and multiplication of 8q. The smallest overrepresented regions
  on 6p and 8q were 6pter-- amp gt p21 and 8q24-- amp gt qter, respectively. Several
  additional gains and losses of chromosome segments were repeatedly observed, the
  most frequent one being loss of 9p three cases . Monosomy 3 appeared to be a marker
  for ciliary body involvement. CGH data were compared with the results of chromosome
  banding. Some alterations, e.g., gains of 6p and losses of 6q, were observed with
  higher frequencies after CGH, while others, e.g., 9p deletions, were detected only
  by CGH. The data suggest some similarities of cytogenetic alterations between cutaneous
  and uveal melanoma. In particular, the 9p deletions are of interest due to recent
  reports about the location of a putative tumor-suppressor gene for cutaneous malignant
  melanoma in this region.
