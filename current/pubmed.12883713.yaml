abstract: 'DNA copy number changes were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH in 53 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas ESCC to clarify the relationship between
  DNA sequence copy number aberrations and clinicopathological factors. Changes in
  DNA copy number were observed in all 53 ESCC patients. The average number of DNA
  copy number gains was 9.32 range 1-23 , most frequently located on chromosomes 3q,
  5p, 8q, 11q and Xq in over 40 of tumors. Loss of DNA copy number was detected on
  3p, 5q, 4p, 1p and Xp in over 20 of tumors. No statistically significant differences
  in the frequency of DNA copy number changes were observed. However, some loci showed
  correlation with clinicopathologic factors: 8q gain correlated with the pattern
  of tumor infiltration, 3q gain correlated with pT, 2p gain, 1p loss and 16p loss
  correlated with lymphatic invasion, and 3q gain correlated with clinical stage.
  Thus, in ESCC, gain of 3q is the only specific recurrent pattern of DNA aberration
  that correlates with clinicopathologic parameters, although no particular loci correlated
  with patient prognosis. Further CGH analysis may reveal new, recurrent genetic changes
  in ESCC affecting chromosomes sites that harbor genes known to participate in tumorigenesis
  and progression of several human malignant neoplasms.'
