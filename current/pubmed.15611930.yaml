abstract: Molecular cytogenetic techniques enabled us to clarify numerical and structural
  alterations previously detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques in 37 patients
  who had myelodysplastic syndromes with complex karyotypes. Using high-resolution
  comparative genomic hybridization HR-CGH , we found the most recurrent alterations
  to be deletion of 5q 70 , 18q 35 , 7q 32 , 11q 30 , and 20q 24 , gain of 11q 35
  and 8q 24 , and trisomy of chromosome 8 19 . Furthermore, in 35 of the patients,
  20 amplifications were identified. These amplifications were shown by FISH to involve
  some genes previously described as amplified in hematological malignancies, such
  as ERBB2, MLL, and RUNX1. In addition, two other genes, BCL6 and BCL2, which are
  classically related to apoptosis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, were shown for the first
  time to be involved in amplification. Genomic alterations involving different subtelomeric
  regions with losses in 4p16, 5p15.3, 6q27, 18p11.3, and 18q23 and gains in 1p36.3
  and 19p13.3 were detected by HR-CGH. Array CGH analysis of the subtelomeric regions
  in some samples was able to confirm a number of these alterations and found some
  additional alterations not detected by conventional CGH.
