abstract: Congenital malignant melanoma within a pre-existing large congenital melanocytic
  naevus CMN is exceedingly rare. Its incidence is difficult to determine due to the
  small number of reported cases and because of problems associated with diagnosis.
  Some benign nodular proliferations called proliferative nodules arising in CMN,
  while rare, are significantly more common and can mimic malignant melanoma clinically
  or histologically. There are no reported cases of congenital melanoma or benign
  proliferative nodules in CMN in patients who also had eruptive disseminated Spitz
  naevi. We describe a girl who was noted to have a dark-brown plaque with several
  large erythematous nodules affecting the scalp at delivery, in addition to multiple
  erythematous dome-shaped papules that developed in a disseminated manner over several
  months, beginning at 10 days of age. It was difficult, not only clinically but also
  histologically, to determine the benign or malignant nature of all of these lesions.
  As primary cutaneous melanoma, atypical proliferative nodules in CMN, bland CMN
  or CMN with foci of increased cellularity and Spitz naevi show clear differences
  in the genetic aberration patterns, comparative genomic hybridization CGH could
  be a diagnostic help in ambiguous cases such as this. CGH performed on this patient
  showed multiple DNA copy number changes in the most atypical nodule, but such alterations
  could not be found in the remainder of the lesions. CGH showed differences between
  the nodular lesions that occurred in the CMN and helped us in supporting the diagnosis
  of this unique case of benign proliferative nodules and a possible congenital melanoma
  arising in a large CMN, associated with multiple widespread eruptive Spitz naevi.
