abstract: Cytogenetic changes are widely unknown for nonpolypoid synonymously termed
  as amp quot flat amp quot or amp quot depressed amp quot colorectal adenomas. A
  comparison with polypoid adenomas will contribute to the discussion whether different
  genetic pathways for colorectal tumorigenesis depending on its origin from nonpolypoid
  or polypoid adenomas exist. Tissue samples of nonpolypoid n 22 , polypoid n 28 adenomas,
  carcinomas ex-nonpolypoid adenomas n 9 , carcinomas ex-polypoid adenomas n 14 ,
  and normal colonic mucosa n 9 were investigated by comparative genomic hybridization
  of whole genomic DNA. Chromosomal imbalances were detected from average comparative
  genomic hybridization profiles for each entity. Nonpolypoid adenomas show recurrent
  chromosomal losses on chromosomes 16, 17p, 18, 20, and 22 and gains on chromosomes
  2q, 4q, 5, 6, 8q, 12q, and 13q. In polypoid adenomas losses of whole chromosomes
  16, 18, and 22 and gains of chromosomes 7q and 13 were detected. The frequency of
  copy number changes was higher in nonpolypoid compared to polypoid adenomas and
  early onset of chromosomal changes became apparent in low-grade dysplasias of nonpolypoid
  adenomas. Gains on chromosomes 2q, 5, 6, 8q, and 12q and losses on chromosomes 17p
  and 20 occurred exclusively in nonpolypoid adenomas, whereas 16p deletions are significantly
  more frequent in nonpolypoid than in polypoid adenomas. Carcinomas ex-nonpolypoid
  adenomas are characterized by more complex aberration patterns compared to nonpolypoid
  adenomas exhibiting frequent losses on chromosomes 8p, 12q, 14, 15q, 16, 17p, 18,
  and 22 and gains on 3q, 5, 6, 7, 8q, 12q, and 13, respectively. Normal colonic mucosa
  showed no chromosomal imbalances. Distinct differences of chromosomal imbalances
  between nonpolypoid and polypoid colorectal adenomas have been characterized that
  support the hypothesis that different genetic pathways may exist in the development
  of colorectal adenomas exhibiting nonpolypoid and polypoid phenotype.
