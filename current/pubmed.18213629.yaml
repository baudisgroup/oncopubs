abstract: Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta is a potent growth inhibitor in
  a wide range of cell types. A transducer of TGF-beta signaling known as Mothers
  against decapentaplegic homologue 4 Smad4 is a known tumor suppressor found on chromosome
  18q21.1 and is typically inactivated by deletion or mutation in pancreatic and colorectal
  cancers. The purpose of the article is to investigate Smad4 expression, gene copy
  number and methylation status in advanced cases of prostate cancer.
