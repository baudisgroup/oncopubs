abstract: The t 8 21 Acute Myeloid Leukaemia AML Kasumi-1 cell line with N822K KIT
  mutation, is a model system for leukemogenesis. As AML initiating cells reside in
  the CD34 CD38 - fraction, we addressed the refined cytogenomic characterization
  and miRNA expression of Kasumi-1 cell line and its FACS-sorted subpopulations focussing
  on this compartment. By conventional cytogenetics, Spectral-Karyotyping and array-CGH
  the cytogenomic profile of Kasumi-1 cells evidenced only subtle regions differentially
  represented in CD34 CD38 - cells. Expression profiling by a miRNA platform showed
  a set of miRNA differentially expressed in paired subpopulations and the signature
  of miR-584 and miR-182 upregulation in the CD34 CD38 - fraction.
