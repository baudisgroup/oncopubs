abstract: Gliosarcoma is a rare glioblastoma variant characterized by a biphasic tissue
  pattern with alternating areas that display either glial glial fibrillary acidic
  protein-positive or mesenchymal reticulin-positive differentiation. Previous analyses
  have shown identical genetic alterations in glial and mesenchymal tumor areas, suggesting
  that gliosarcomas are genetically monoclonal, and mesenchymal differentiation was
  considered to reflect the elevated genomic instability of glioblastomas. In the
  present study, we compared genome-wide chromosomal imbalances using array comparative
  genomic hybridization in glial and mesenchymal tumor areas of 13 gliosarcomas. The
  patterns of gain and loss were similar, except that the gain at 13q13.3-q14.1 log
  2 ratio amp gt 3.0 , containing the STOML3, FREM2, and LHFP genes, which was restricted
  to the mesenchymal tumor area of a gliosarcoma. Further analyses of 64 cases of
  gliosarcoma using quantitative PCR showed amplification of the STOML3, FREM2, and
  LHFP genes in 14 22 , 10 16 , and 7 11 mesenchymal tumor areas, respectively, but
  not in glial tumor areas. Results of IHC analysis confirmed that overexpression
  of STOML3 and FREM2 was more extensive in mesenchymal than in glial tumor areas.
  These results suggest that the mesenchymal components in a small fraction of gliosarcomas
  may be derived from glial cells with additional genetic alterations.
