abstract: Wilms tumor WT is one of the most common solid tumors in childhood. It is
  characterized by a nonrandom pattern of chromosomal aberrations whose clinical significance
  is still uncertain. To gain further insight into different genetic events and their
  corresponding biological role, conventional cytogenetics and array comparative genomic
  hybridization array CGH were performed on 13 tumor samples. In two of these, array
  CGH revealed, together with other aberrations, a low-level amplification and an
  unbalanced gain in the region of chromosome bands 2p23 approximately p24 that encompass
  the MYCN gene. Both events were confirmed with a MYCN-specific fluorescence in situ
  hybridization probe, which showed a signal pattern consistent with a small homogenous
  staining region in one case. In addition, mRNA expression levels for MYCN were determined
  by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and revealed that
  gain of chromosomal material was reflected in enhanced levels of MYCN mRNA in both
  tumors, whereby also additional tumors showed increased MYCN expression. Therefore,
  our findings suggest that WT is an additional childhood tumor where MYCN gain might
  play an important role in tumor development.
