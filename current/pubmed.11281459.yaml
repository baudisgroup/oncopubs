abstract: Although it is established that the loss of function of both alleles of
  the RB1 gene is a prerequisite for the development of retinoblastoma, little is
  known about the genetic events that are required for tumor progression. We used
  comparative genomic hybridization CGH to search for DNA copy number changes in isolated
  unilateral retinoblastomas. From a series of 66 patients with retinoblastomas with
  somatic mutations in both RB1 alleles, tumor samples from 13 children with the youngest
  2.0-9.8 months and 13 with the oldest 36.2-84.1 months age at operation were studied.
  Loss at 13q14, the location of RB1, was demonstrated in two tumors only. Recurring
  chromosome imbalances included gains at 6p 11 26 , 1q 10 26 , 2p 4 26 , and 17q
  4 26 , gains of the entire chromosome 19 3 26 , and losses at 16q 9 26 . A commonly
  gained region at 1q32 was identified. Increased dosage of GAC1, a candidate oncogene
  located in 1q32, was found in two of four tumors by Southern blot analysis. Comparison
  of the CGH findings revealed that retinoblastomas from children with an older age
  at operation showed significantly more frequent 13 13 cases vs 4 13 cases P 0.0005
  and more complex genetic abnormalities median, 5 changes abnormal tumor vs median,
  1.5 changes abnormal tumor P 0.003 than retinoblastomas from children with a young
  age at operation. Gains at 1q, 2p, 17q, of the entire chromosome 19 and losses of
  16q were restricted to the older age group. Our results suggest that the progression
  of retinoblastomas from older patients follows mutational pathways different from
  those of younger patients.
