abstract: Whole-genome copy number analysis platforms, such as array comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH and single nucleotide polymorphism SNP arrays, are transformative
  research discovery tools. In cancer, the identification of genomic aberrations with
  these approaches has generated important diagnostic and prognostic markers, and
  critical therapeutic targets. While robust for basic research studies, reliable
  whole-genome copy number analysis has been unsuccessful in routine clinical practice
  due to a number of technical limitations. Most important, aCGH results have been
  suboptimal because of the poor integrity of DNA derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  FFPE tissues. Using self-hybridizations of a single DNA sample we observed that
  aCGH performance is significantly improved by accurate DNA size determination and
  the matching of test and reference DNA samples so that both possess similar fragment
  sizes. Based on this observation, we developed a novel DNA fragmentation simulation
  method FSM that allows customized tailoring of the fragment sizes of test and reference
  samples, thereby lowering array failure rates. To validate our methods, we combined
  FSM with Universal Linkage System ULS labeling to study a cohort of 200 tumor samples
  using Agilent 1 M feature arrays. Results from FFPE samples were equivalent to results
  from fresh samples and those available through the glioblastoma Cancer Genome Atlas
  TCGA . This study demonstrates that rigorous control of DNA fragment size improves
  aCGH performance. This methodological advance will permit the routine analysis of
  FFPE tumor samples for clinical trials and in daily clinical practice.
