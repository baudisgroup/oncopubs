abstract: Gastroesophageal reflux has recently been implicated as a causative factor
  in upper aerodigestive tract carcinogenesis. Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
  ESCCs have developed in duodenal-content reflux animals without any known carcinogen
  present. We established a cell line, designated ESCC-DR, from a thoracic metastatic
  tumor in a reflux animal. To gain insight into the genomic alterations associated
  with duodenal content reflux-induced carcinogenesis, we first performed comparative
  genomic hybridization using an Agilent rat 244K array in ESCC-DR and identified
  many chromosomal gains and losses. Of the many genes identified, we detected an
  interesting ezrin amplicon that has been recently reported in human ESCC. Ezrin,
  which cross-links the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, is involved in the growth
  and metastatic potential of cancer cells. Overexpression of ezrin protein in ESCC-DR
  was confirmed by Western blotting. We also compared ezrin protein expression levels
  and patterns in hyperplastic, dysplastic, ESCC, and metastatic sites developed in
  two distinct reflux models using immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining
  of ezrin revealed overexpression in the nucleus, and the cytoplasm as well as plasma
  membrane of ESCC cells. Phosphorylated ERM ezrin, radixin, moesin was expressed
  at the leading edge, or invasive front, of larger metastatic sites. Taken together,
  duodenal reflux has a great potential for initiating malignancy, and thus likely
  plays a role in development of ESCC. Ezrin probably influences the growth and invasiveness
  of ESCC cells, and phosphorylation is only required in metastatic behavior of tumor
  cells at the leading edge and invasive front.
