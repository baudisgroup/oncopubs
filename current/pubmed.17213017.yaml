abstract: Resistance to the HER-2 targeting drug trastuzumab can be observed clinically,
  but the lack of suitable experimental models hampers studies of resistance mechanisms.
  We characterized a HER-2-positive carcinoma cell line JIMT-1 derived from a 62-year-old
  breast cancer patient which was clinically resistant to trastuzumab. Multicolor
  fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a complex hyperdiploid karyotype with
  numerous marker chromosomes and unbalanced translocations. Comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH revealed numerous regions of copy number aberration CNA . Further analysis by
  array CGH identified 27 regions of CNA 16 amplified, 11 deleted . Thirty-eight percent
  of the genes in the amplified regions were overexpressed, compared to only 9 in
  regions of normal copy number ratios CNR . Accordingly, 26 of the genes in the deleted
  regions were underexpressed, compared to 10 in regions of normal CNR. Most amplified
  and overexpressed genes were located on chromosome 1 as well as on 8q, 12q14.1,
  17q11 approximately q21, and 20q13. In 17q11 approximately q21, we identified two
  separate amplicons, the HER-2 amplicon and a previously unreported amplicon at 17q21.31.
  Several aberrant genes are implicated in cancer development e.g., JUN, CDK4, and
  SLUG protooncogenes, as well as the drug hormone-metabolizing genes GSTM1 and CYP24
  . We conclude that cytogenetic and expression profiling of JIMT-1 revealed several
  new features that need further characterization and may shed light on trastuzumab
  resistance.
