abstract: We applied a comparative genomic hybridization CGH technique to paraffin-embedded
  tissue samples taken from fibroadenomas, benign breast tumors, to detect possible
  numerical and unbalanced genetic changes. We compared the results to those from
  previous cytogenetic studies of fibroadenomas. In concurrence with previous cytogenetic
  studies of fibroadenomas, we detected genetic aberrations in chromosomes 4-6, 8-13,
  16, 18, 19, 20, and 22. In addition, with the CGH technique we were able to find
  two new aberrations, 15q and 16p-. Because these aberrations have also been reported
  to be present in breast cancer, the importance of this finding is yet to be determined.
