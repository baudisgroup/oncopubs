abstract: We analyzed 17 cases of dysplasia carcinoma in situ CIS of the cervix and
  29 advanced-stage cervical squamous cell carcinomas by comparative genomic hybridization
  CGH . A comparable recurrent pattern of aberrations was detected in both preinvasive
  and invasive cases, although the total number of aberrations was much higher in
  the latter category. The most consistent chromosomal gain was mapped to chromosome
  arm 3q in 35 of preinvasive cases and in 72 of invasive cases. Chromosome aberrations
  were detected in 13 17 preinvasive cases with a total of 61 involved chromosome
  arms. In the invasive cases, frequent gains also occurred on 1q 45 , 8q 41 , 15q
  41 , 5p 34 , and Xq 34 , and frequent losses were mapped to chromosome arms 3p 52
  , 11q 48 , 13q 38 , 6q 38 , and 4p 34 . A recurrent pattern of aberrations has not
  previously been described in preinvasive lesions of the cervix. Our finding is surprising
  considering that only few preinvasive lesions are expected to progress to invasive
  cancer.
