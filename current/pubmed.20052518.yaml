abstract: Little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular genetic events that
  lead to the formation of paediatric astrocytoma. We have analysed 57 paediatric
  astrocytoma WHO grades I-IV using comparative genomic hybridisation in order to
  identify common regions of abnormality. Large regions of copy number alterations
  were infrequent with 71 of tumours demonstrating no genomic imbalance. Furthermore,
  the most frequent aberrations including gain of 6q, 2q, and 7q, and loss of 16 and
  12q occurred in only a subset of cases. High-copy number amplification was seen
  in five tumours at 12 different regions. The presence of copy number alterations
  was significantly associated with increasing grade of malignancy, and gain of 12q
  and the presence of high-copy number amplification were associated with a poor outcome
  in patients with malignant astrocytoma P 0.0039 and 0.0085, respectively . FISH
  analysis confirmed loss of 1p36 identified by CGH. There was no evidence of amplification
  of EGFR, CDK4, MET, CDK6, c-myc, or MDM2.
