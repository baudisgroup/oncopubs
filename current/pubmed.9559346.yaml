abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH is a technique that allows the detection
  of losses and gains in DNA copy number across the entire genome. We used CGH to
  study the genetic alterations that occur in primary astrocytomas, including 14 glioblastomas
  GBM , 12 anaplastic astrocytomas AA , and 7 low-grade astrocytomas LGA . The average
  numbers of total aberrations in GBM, AA, and LGA were 9.7, 5.4, and 4.0, respectively.
  The average number of DNA sequence losses in GBM was significantly higher than that
  in AA or LGA P amp lt 0.01 . Frequently altered regions amp gt eight cases observed
  in all grades of astrocytoma were 7p13-p12 gain , 7q31 gain , 8q24.1-q24.2 gain
  , 9p21 loss , 10p12-p11 loss , 10q22-qter loss , 13q21-q22 loss , and 20q13.1-q13.2
  gain . Loss of 9p, 10p, or 10q, and the gain or amplification of 7p, were observed
  frequently in GBM 64 , 57 , 64 , and 50 of cases, respectively . Frequent alterations
  found in AA were losses of 9p, 10q, and 13q, and gains of 1q, chromosome 7, 11q,
  and Xq. Whereas 7p13-p11 amplification occurred exclusively in cases with the loss
  of all or part of chromosome 10, this change never occurred in cases having an increase
  in copy number of 8q, which was the most frequent change observed in LGA four of
  seven cases . These results may indicate that an increase in copy number of 8q is
  an important event in GBM, with a genetic pathway, which is distinct from that in
  GBM with 7p amplification.
