abstract: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma PXA is a rare, low-grade astrocytic tumor
  found in the central nervous system. Histologically, the tumor is characterized
  by markedly pleomorphic and lipidized cells. Although most of the patients have
  a favorable prognosis, a small number of cases undergoing recurrence or progression
  to anaplastic astrocytoma were reported. Very few genetic studies have been performed
  on PXA because of its rarity and the pathogenesis of this neoplasm is largely unknown.
  In order to provide an overview of genetic alterations in PXA, we performed comparative
  genomic hybridization to identify chromosomal imbalances DNA gains and losses in
  three cases of PXA. Genetic imbalance was detected on at least one chromosome for
  each case. One case, which revealed multiple genetic alterations, showed a poor
  prognosis. DNA gain on chromosome 7 and loss on 8p were demonstrated in two of three
  cases, suggesting that the candidate gene s located on these regions may play a
  role in the development of PXA. Further studies are needed to identify the residing
  candidate genes that are involved in the tumorigenesis of PXA. In addition, the
  histopathological features and previous genetic studies on PXA are reviewed.
