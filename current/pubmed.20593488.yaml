abstract: Chromosomal instable colorectal cancer is marked by specific large chromosomal
  copy number aberrations. Recently, focal aberrations of 3 Mb or smaller have been
  identified as a common phenomenon in cancer. Inherent to their limited size, these
  aberrations harbour one or few genes. The aim of this study was to identify recurrent
  focal chromosomal aberrations and their candidate driver genes in a well-defined
  series of stage II colon cancers and assess their potential clinical relevance.
  High-resolution DNA copy number profiles were obtained from 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
  colon cancer samples with matched normal mucosa as a reference using array comparative
  genomic hybridization. In total, 81 focal chromosomal aberrations were identified
  that harboured 177 genes. Statistical validation of focal aberrations and identification
  of candidate driver genes were performed by enrichment analysis and mapping copy
  number and mutation data of colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancer and glioblastomas
  to loci of focal aberrations in stage II colon cancer. This analysis demonstrated
  a significant overlap with previously identified focal amplifications in colorectal
  cancer, but not with cancers from other sites. In contrast, focal deletions seemed
  less tumour type-specific since they also showed significant overlap with focal
  deletions of other sites. Focal deletions detected were significantly enriched for
  cancer genes and genes frequently mutated in colorectal cancer. The mRNA expression
  of these genes was significantly correlated with DNA copy number status, supporting
  the relevance of focal aberrations. Loss of 5q34 and gain of 13q22.1 were identified
  as independent prognostic factors of survival in this series of patients. In conclusion,
  focal chromosomal copy number aberrations in stage II colon cancer are enriched
  in cancer genes that contribute to and drive the process of colorectal cancer development.
  DNA copy number status of these genes correlates with mRNA expression and some are
  associated with clinical outcome.
