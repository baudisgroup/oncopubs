abstract: 'Genomic aberrations on chromosome 8 are common in colon cancer, and are
  associated with lymph node and distant metastases as well as with disease susceptibility.
  This prompted us to generate a high-resolution map of genomic imbalances of chromosome
  8 in 51 primary colon carcinomas using a custom-designed genomic array consisting
  of a tiling path of BAC clones. This analysis confirmed the dominant role of this
  chromosome. Unexpectedly, the position of the breakpoints suggested colocalization
  with structural variants in the human genome. In order to map these sites with increased
  resolution and to extend the analysis to the entire genome, we analyzed a subset
  of these tumors n 32 by comparative genomic hybridization on a 185K oligonucleotide
  array platform. Our comprehensive map of the colon cancer genome confirmed recurrent
  and specific low-level copy number changes of chromosomes 7, 8, 13, 18, and 20,
  and unveiled additional, novel sites of genomic imbalances including amplification
  of a histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p21.1-21.33 and deletions on chromosome
  4q34-35. The systematic comparison of segments of copy number change with gene expression
  profiles showed that genomic imbalances directly affect average expression levels.
  Strikingly, we observed a significant association of chromosomal breakpoints with
  structural variants in the human genome: 41 of all copy number changes occurred
  at sites of such copy number variants P amp lt 2.2e -16 . Such an association has
  not been previously described and reveals a yet underappreciated plasticity of the
  colon cancer genome it also points to potential mechanisms for the induction of
  chromosomal breakage in cancer cells.'
