abstract: Juvenile angiofibroma JA is a unique fibrovascular tumor, which is almost
  exclusively found in the posterior nasal cavity of adolescent males. Although histologically
  classified as benign, the tumor often shows an aggressive growth pattern and has
  been associated with chromosomal imbalances, amplification of oncogenes and epigenetic
  dysregulation. We present the first genome-wide profiling of JAs n 14 with a 100K
  single nucleotide polymorphism SNP microarray. Among the 30 novel JA-specific amplifications
  detected on autosomal chromosomes with this technique, the genes encoding the cancer-testis
  antigen BORIS brother of the regulator of imprinted sites and the developmental
  regulator protein TSHZ1 teashirt zinc finger homeobox 1 were selected for further
  analysis. Gains for both BORIS 20q13.3 and TSHZ1 18q22.3 were confirmed by quantitative
  genomic PCR. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR revealed a significant up-regulation
  of BORIS p amp lt 0.001 and TSHZ1 transcripts p amp lt 0.05 for JAs compared to
  nasal mucosa. Following detection of BORIS and TSHZ1 proteins in western blots of
  JAs, subcellular localization was determined for both proteins in immunostaining
  of JA cryosections. In conclusion, genomic copy number profiling using an SNP microarray
  has been proven to be a suitable and reliable tool for identifying novel disease-related
  genes in JAs and newly implicates BORIS and TSHZ1 overexpression in the pathogenesis
  of JAs. Detection of BORIS in JAs is described with special regard to tumor proliferation
  and epigenetic dysregulation, and the finding of TSHZ1 amplifications is discussed
  with special respect to the hypothesis of JAs as malformations of the first branchial
  arch artery.
