abstract: Merkel cell carcinoma MCC is an aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
  skin. Disease progression usually occurs via lymphatic spread to regional lymphatic
  draining basins, followed by distant metastasis. We report the clinical course,
  histopathology and genetic analysis of a 69-year-old woman with likely hematogenous
  spread of cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma manifesting as a single metastatic
  lesion to a distant cutaneous site. Although the possibility of two cutaneous primary
  MCCs was considered, array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH identified identical
  distal amplification of a region of chromosome 12p, and synchronous loss of chromosomes
  8p and 17p, effectively ruling out the possibility of independent primaries. We
  propose that this represents a primary cheek MCC with rapid, isolated cutaneous
  metastasis to the contralateral ankle via hematogenous spread. The distinction between
  a second primary MCC and a distant cutaneous metastasis clearly has important implications
  with regard to staging, treatment and prognosis. To our knowledge, this represents
  the first report of the use of aCGH to clarify the relationship of multiple synchronous
  cutaneous MCCs and the first report of a single distant cutaneous focus of hematogenous
  spread. Our data calls into question prior reports alleging multiple cutaneous primaries
  of this very rare tumor.
