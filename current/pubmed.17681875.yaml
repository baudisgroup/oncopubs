abstract: Classical and molecular cytogenetic analysis, including fluorescence in
  situ hybridization FISH and chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization CGH ,
  were used to examine genetic changes involved in the development and or progression
  of oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC . Of 31 OSCC cell lines studied, more than
  one-third expressed clonal structural abnormalities involving chromosomes 3, 7,
  8, 9, and 11. Eleven OSCC cell lines were evaluated using CGH to identify novel
  genome-wide gains, losses, or amplifications. By CGH, more than half of the cell
  lines showed loss of 3p, gain of 3q, 8q, and 20q. Further, molecular cytogenetic
  analyses by FISH of primary tumors showed that the karyotypes of cell lines derived
  from those tumors correlated with specific gains and losses in the tumors from which
  they were derived. The most frequent nonrandom aberration identified by both karyotype
  and CGH analyses was amplification of chromosomal band 11q13 in the form of a homogeneously
  staining region. Our data suggest that loss of 9p and 11q13 amplification may be
  of prognostic benefit in the management of OSCC, which is consistent with the literature.
  The results of this study validate the relationship between these OSCC cell lines
  and the tumors from which they were derived. The results also emphasize the usefulness
  of these cell lines as in vitro experimental models and provide important genetic
  information on these OSCC cell lines that were recently reported in this journal.
