abstract: In this study, we correlated array-comparative genomic hybridization-defined
  abnormalities with survival in two different cohorts of patients treated with therapy
  based on high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplantation 64 from the
  Mayo Clinic and 67 from the University of Arkansas Medical School and identified
  that several regions of genomic gains and losses were significantly associated with
  poorer survival. Three noncontiguous survival relevant regions covering 1p31-33
  and two noncontiguous regions covering 20p12.3-12.1 were common between the two
  datasets. The prognostic relevance of these hotspots was validated in an independent
  cohort using fluorescent in situ hybridization, which showed that 1p31-32 loss is
  significantly associated with shorter survival 24.5 months versus 40 months, log-rank
  P-value 0.01 , whereas 20p12 loss has a trend toward shorter survival 26.3 months
  versus 40 months, log-rank P-value 0.06 . On multivariate analysis, 1p31-32 loss
  is an independent prognostic factor. On further analysis, the prognostic impact
  of 1p31-32 loss is due to shortening of post-relapse survival as there is no impact
  on complete response rates and progression-free survival.
