abstract: Genomic analyses of hundreds of prostate tumors have defined a diverse landscape
  of mutations and genome rearrangements, but the transcriptomic effect of this complexity
  is less well understood, particularly at the individual tumor level. We selected
  a cohort of 25 high-risk prostate tumors, representing the lethal phenotype, and
  applied deep RNA-sequencing and matched whole genome sequencing, followed by detailed
  molecular characterization.  Ten tumors were exposed to neo-adjuvant hormone therapy
  and expressed marked evidence of therapy response in all except one extreme case,
  which demonstrated early resistance via apparent neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.
  We observe high inter-tumor heterogeneity, including unique sets of outlier transcripts
  in each tumor. Interestingly, outlier expression converged on druggable cellular
  pathways associated with cell cycle progression, translational control or immune
  regulation, suggesting distinct contemporary pathway affinity and a mechanism of
  tumor stratification. We characterize hundreds of novel fusion transcripts, including
  a high frequency of ETS fusions associated with complex genome rearrangements and
  the disruption of tumor suppressors. Remarkably, several tumors express unique but
  potentially-oncogenic non-ETS fusions, which may contribute to the phenotype of
  individual tumors, and have significance for disease progression. Finally, one ETS-negative
  tumor has a striking tandem duplication genotype which appears to be highly aggressive
  and present at low recurrence in ETS-negative prostate cancer, suggestive of a novel
  molecular subtype.  The multitude of rare genomic and transcriptomic events detected
  in a high-risk tumor cohort offer novel opportunities for personalized oncology
  and their convergence on key pathways and functions has broad implications for precision
  medicine.
