abstract: The methylthioadenosine phosphorylase MTAP gene is located on 9p21 telomeric
  to the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene. Loss of MTAP gene is frequently associated
  with CDKN2A homozygous deletion. Although the homozygous deletion of MTAP has been
  reported in various human cancers, its function in gastric carcinogenesis is unknown.
  Here, we determined the status of the MTAP gene by using a combination of array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization and oligonucleotide microarray. It was found that
  MTAP was deleted and downregulated in 2 of 10 gastric cancer cell lines. Of the
  494 primary gastric carcinomas examined, MTAP expression at the protein level was
  reduced in 59 11.9 . Furthermore, a lack of MTAP expression was found to be associated
  with poor survival P 0.038 . The genomic loss of MTAP and CDKN2A in gastric carcinomas
  was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. Among 20 gastric carcinomas, two
  cases showed deletion of both MTAP and CDKN2A, and three samples showed homozygous
  deletion of MTAP, but not of CDKN2A. An analysis of gastric carcinomas revealed
  that reduced MTAP expression correlated significantly with a genomic deletion. Furthermore,
  functional assays by transfecting the siRNA or the expressional cDNA into gastric
  cancer cell lines demonstrated that MTAP regulates cell growth and invasion. The
  present study suggests that MTAP plays an important role in the regulation of gastric
  carcinogenesis and, in particular, that MTAP loss is implicated in some way with
  tumor growth via the modulation of cellular properties, which, in turn, suggests
  that MTAP has therapeutic applications.
