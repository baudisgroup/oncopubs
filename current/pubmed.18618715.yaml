abstract: For a better understanding of the consequences of recurrent chromosomal
  alterations in cervical carcinomas, we integrated genome-wide chromosomal and transcriptional
  profiles of 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 5 adenocarcinomas (AdCAs) and 6
  normal controls. Previous genomic profiling showed that gains at chromosome arms
  1q, 3q, and 20q as well as losses at 8q, 10q, 11q, and 13q were common in cervical
  carcinomas. Altered regions spanned multiple megabases, and the extent to which
  expression of genes located there is affected remains unclear. Expression analysis
  of these previously chromosomally profiled carcinomas yielded 83 genes with significantly
  differential expression between carcinomas and normal epithelium. Application of
  differential gene locus mapping (DIGMAP) analysis and the array CGH expression integration
  tool (ACE-it) identified hotspots within large chromosomal alterations in which
  gene expression was altered as well. Chromosomal gains of the long arms of chromosome
  1, 3, and 20 resulted in increased expression of genes located at 1q32.1-32.2, 3q13.32-23,
  3q26.32-27.3, and 20q11.21-13.33, whereas a chromosomal loss of 11q22.3-25 was related
  to decreased expression of genes located in this region. Overexpression of DTX3L,
  PIK3R4, ATP2C1, and SLC25A36, all located at 3q21.1-23 and identified by DIGMAP,
  ACE-it or both, was confirmed in an independent validation sample set consisting
  of 12 SCCs and 13 normal ectocervical samples. In conclusion, integrated chromosomal
  and transcriptional profiling identified chromosomal hotspots at 1q, 3q, 11q, and
  20q with altered gene expression within large commonly altered chromosomal regions
  in cervical cancer.
