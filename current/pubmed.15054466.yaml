abstract: Distinct parallel cytogenetic pathways in breast carcinogenesis could be
  identified in recent years. Nevertheless, it remained unclear as to which tumours
  may have progressed in grade or which patterns of cytogenetic alteration may define
  the switch from an in situ towards an invasive lesion. In order to gain more detailed
  insights into cytogenetic mechanisms of the pathogenesis of breast cancer, the chromosomal
  imbalances of 206 invasive breast cancer cases were characterised by means of comparative
  genomic hybridisation CGH . CGH data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis
  and the results were further compared with immunohistochemical findings on tissue
  arrays from the same breast cancer cases. The combined analysis of immunohistochemical
  and cytogenetic data provided evidence that carcinomas with gains of 7p, and to
  a lesser extent losses of 9q and gains of 5p, are a distinct subgroup within the
  spectrum of ductal invasive grade 3 breast carcinomas. These aberrations were associated
  with a high degree of cytogenetic instability 16.6 alterations per case on average
  , 16q-losses in over 70 of these cases, strong oestrogen receptor expression and
  absence of strong expression of p53, c-erbB2 and Ck 5. These characteristics provide
  strong support for the hypothesis that these tumours may develop through stages
  of well- and perhaps intermediately differentiated breast cancers. Our results therefore
  underline the existence of several parallel and also stepwise progression pathways
  towards breast cancer.
