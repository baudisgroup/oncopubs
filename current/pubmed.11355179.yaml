abstract: Clear-cell odontogenic carcinoma CCOC is a rare neoplasm with malignant
  potential and unknown cytogenetic alterations. We describe the case of a 43-year-old
  woman who presented with an unusual odontogenic epithelial tumor. Histologically,
  the tumor was composed of clear-cell areas and exhibited a squamous pattern with
  little nuclear pleomorphism similar to benign squamous odontogenic tumor. Multiple
  small pulmonary nodules occurring 3 years after primary surgical treatment histologically
  closely resembled benign minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules MPMN with
  clear-cell features. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH and immunohistochemistry,
  performed as diagnostic adjuncts, revealed in the odontogenic tumor and the pulmonary
  lesions a very similar pattern of chromosomal aberrations loss of 9, gains of 14q,
  19 and 20 in both, and additional loss of 6 in the odontogenic tumor and the same
  pattern of expression positive for cytokeratin 5, 6, 8, 19 and negative for cytokeratin
  18, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin , differing from that of MPMN. These
  findings confirmed the final diagnosis of metastasizing CCOC with partial squamous
  differentiation, substantiated the unfavorable prognosis of the clear-cell component,
  and highlighted the diagnostic impact of CGH and immunohistochemistry for classification
  of these morphologically peculiar pulmonary CCOC metastases.
