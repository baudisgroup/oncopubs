abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is one of the most common malignancies worldwide
  and has a very poor prognosis. Fifty primary HCC cases have been analyzed in the
  present study to explore the association between genomic alteration in primary HCC
  and clinical features. Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were identified
  in this study. The most frequently detected chromosomal gains involved chromosome
  arms 1q 33 50 cases, 66 , 8q 24 50 cases, 48 , and 20q 10 50 cases, 20 . High-copy-number
  amplifications involving 1q 4 cases , 8q 3 cases , and 20q 3 cases were detected,
  and a minimum overlapping amplified region at 1q12-q22 was identified. The most
  frequently detected loss of chromosomal material involved 16q 35 50 cases, 70 ,
  17p 26 50 cases, 52 , 19p 21 50 cases, 42 , 4q 20 50 cases, 40 , 1p 18 50 cases,
  36 , 8p 16 50 cases, 32 , and 22q 14 50 cases, 28 . The associations between genomic
  alterations detected in the present study and clinical features including clinical
  stage, tumor size, HBV infection, chronic liver disease, and liver cirrhosis were
  explored. Our CGH results suggest that the gain of 20q and deletion of 8p are late
  genetic alterations in HCC, because the incidence of these alterations was obviously
  increased in the advanced clinical stages. Another finding showed that loss of 8p
  and gain of 8q and 20q are associated with tumor size. The recurrent gain and loss
  of chromosomal regions identified in this study provide candidate regions that may
  contain oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes respectively involved in HCC development
  and progression.
