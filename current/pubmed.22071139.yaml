abstract: Older patients with AML have a worse outcome compared to young patients.
  To study for potential contributors to their poor prognosis, we compared two NK-AML
  cohorts, young amp lt 60 years old and old  60 years old , via high density SNP
  array analysis. Older patients had more genomic changes 1.83 0.23 vs. 1.16 0.2,
  p 0.037 and a trend for a higher number of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity
  0.5 0.2 vs. 0.24 0.08, p 0.088 compared to young patients. We speculate that complex
  genomic changes in NK-AML may be a sign of an increase in genomic instability and
  an indicator of a worse prognosis.
