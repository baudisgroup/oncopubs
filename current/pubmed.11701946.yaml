abstract: The cell line U937, which has been used extensively for studies of myeloid
  differentiation, bears the t 10 11 p13 q14 translocation which results in a fusion
  between the MLLT10 myeloid lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia trithorax, Drosophila,
  homolog translocated to 10 alias AF10 gene and the Ap-3-like clathrin assembly protein,
  PICALM Clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukaemia . Apart from this translocation,
  very little is known about the other genetic alterations in this cell line that
  may represent significant events in disease progression. In this study, conventional
  G-banding, CGH and M-FISH have been used to characterise fully all of the cytogenetic
  alterations present in the U937 cell line. M-FISH analysis confirmed the presence
  of the t 10 11 and an apparently normal copy of both chromosomes 10 and 11. A t
  1 5 translocation was observed as well as several unbalanced rearrangements. CGH
  detected amplifications resulting from duplications of 2q, 6p and 13q. These changes
  could result in fusion gene products involved in carcinogenesis or the positions
  of putative oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. A good correlation between conventional
  G-banding, CGH and M-FISH was observed.
