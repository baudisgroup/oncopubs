abstract: Genetic abnormalities were assessed in 56 benign, low-, and high-grade ovarian
  tumors using comparative genomic hybridization CGH and analysis of loss of heterozygosity
  LOH . In addition, 95 epithelial tumors were analyzed for microsatellite repeat
  instability. DNA sequence copy number abnormalities CNAs were not detected in the
  benign tumors, and more were detected in high-grade than in low-grade cancers. Almost
  no microsatellite repeat instability was detected in these cancers. CNAs occurring
  in more than 30 of the cancers included increased copy number on 3q25-26 and 8q24
  and reduced copy number on 16q and 17pter-q21. Another 14 CNAs occurred in more
  than 20 of the cancers. Increased copy number at 3q25-26 and 20q13 was the most
  frequent CNA in low-grade tumors, and increased copy number at 8q24 occurred preferentially
  in high-grade tumors. The presence of a large number of CNAs per tumor was significantly
  correlated with reduced patient survival duration. Reduced copy number on 17pter-q21
  was most strongly associated with accumulation of a large number of CNAs. The overall
  concordance between LOH and reduced copy number detected by CGH was 84 , but only
  31 of the LOH was associated with reduced copy number detected using CGH.
