abstract: To identify genetic abnormalities in primary hepatocellular carcinoma HCC
  , we performed microsatellite analysis MSA on 60 Chinese HCC specimens. Utilizing
  a semi-quantitative MSA and 292 highly polymorphic markers spanning all 22 autosomes,
  we found that somatic allelic imbalance AI occurred frequently in HCC. To evaluate
  the nature of the AI, comparative genomic hybridization was performed on 20 HCC
  specimens. The combined use of these two methods revealed frequent allelic loss
  on 17p, 9p21-p23, 4q, 16q21-q23.3, 13q, 8p21-p23, and 6q24-q27, whereas there was
  frequent allelic gain on 1q, 17q, and 8q24. The region with the highest incidence
  of genomic imbalance was 17p13 65 , followed by 9p21-p23 55 , 4q 35-51 , 16q21-q23.3
  52 , 17p12 49 , 13q 39-46 , 8p21-p23 41-45 , 8q24 41 , and 1q32 40 . In addition,
  aberrations of 19p13.3, 16p13.3, 13q33-q34, 9q13-31, and 7q were reported for the
  first time. The presence of a close correlation of 17p13 deletion with abnormalities
  of some other loci implies that 17p13 could play a crucial role in oncogenesis.
  Interestingly, microsatellite instability was rarely seen in our patients, in contrast
  to that observed in European HCC samples.
