abstract: Integrative genomics approaches associating DNA structure and transcriptomic
  analysis should allow the identification of cascades of events relating to tumor
  aggressiveness. While different genome alterations have been identified in pituitary
  tumors, none have ever been correlated with the aggressiveness. This study focused
  on one subtype of pituitary tumor, the prolactin PRL pituitary tumors, to identify
  molecular events associated with the aggressive and malignant phenotypes. We combined
  a comparative genomic hybridization and transcriptomic analysis of 13 PRL tumors
  classified as nonaggressive or aggressive. Allelic loss within the p arm region
  of chromosome 11 was detected in five of the aggressive tumors. Allelic loss in
  the 11q arm was observed in three of these five tumors, all three of which were
  considered as malignant based on the occurrence of metastases. Comparison of genomic
  and transcriptomic data showed that allelic loss impacted upon the expression of
  genes located in the imbalanced region. Data filtering allowed us to highlight five
  deregulated genes DGKZ, CD44, TSG101, GTF2H1, HTATIP2 , within the missing 11p region,
  potentially responsible for triggering the aggressive and malignant phenotypes of
  PRL tumors. Our combined genomic and transcriptomic analysis underlines the importance
  of chromosome allelic loss in determining the aggressiveness and malignancy of tumors.
