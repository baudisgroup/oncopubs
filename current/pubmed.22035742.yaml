abstract: Chromosomal aberrations are independent prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia CLL . Recent studies using genomic arrays have shown recurrent gains of
  the short arm of chromosome 2 2p in a subset of CLL. We evaluated 178 CLL cases
  for 2p gains using custom-designed oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization aCGH . A high frequency of 2p gains was observed in 53 of 178 30 cases,
  which ranged from a small 29-kb region to large segments involving the entire short
  arm. Besides several common chromosomal aberrations associated with 2p gain, we
  demonstrated a novel observation that gain of the telomeric region 2p25.3 harboring
  the ACP1 gene is common in CLL 25 , 44 of 178 cases . The ACP1 gene has been previously
  shown to regulate T-cell receptor signaling through ZAP-70, and both genes are unfavorable
  clinical markers for CLL. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR confirmed
  the presence of 3-6 copies of ACP1 in 35 of 40 88 of these cases. Interestingly,
  none of the aCGH diploid CLL cases showed gain of ACP1. Assessment of 73 healthy
  individuals by qPCR revealed ACP1 copy number gain in only two cases 2.7 . Gain
  of 2p25.3 was associated with ZAP-70 expression P amp lt .002 and unmutated immunoglobulin
  heavy chain variable IGHV gene mutation P amp lt .0001 . A high frequency of MYCN
  co-amplication with ACP1 was observed 14 of 40 cases, 35 . The frequent 2p25.3 gain
  involving the ACP1 and MYCN genes may help define the critical region of 2p that
  contributes to pathogenesis of CLL together with other chromosomal abnormalities.
