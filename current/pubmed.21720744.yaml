abstract: SET-NUP214 rearrangement is a recently recognized recurrent chromosomal
  translocation mostly observed in T-ALL. In order to characterize this rare entity,
  we performed phenotypic and genetic characterization of SET-NUP214 rearrangement
  through an investigation of a series of 40 consecutive samples of adult T-ALL that
  was selected among 229 adult ALL cases during 4 years in a single institution. Four
  cases 10 of SET-NUP214 translocation were identified in our study. In all cases,
  diagnosis of T-ALL was established according to the World Health Organization WHO
  classification, and clonal TCR rearrangements were found. The immunophenotypic markers
  were indicative of the precursor nature of T lymphoblasts, and they expressed one
  or both of the myeloid-associated antigens CD13, CD33 . Conventional cytogenetic
  analysis revealed complex chromosomal aberrations in all four SET-NUP214 rearranged
  cases and del 12 p13 ETV6 was frequently involved. Array-CGH demonstrated additional
  genomic imbalances in addition to deletion 9q34. The genomic breakpoint sequencing
  identified breakpoints at SET intron 7 and NUP214 intron 17, and random nucleotide
  addition was found in two cases at the site of rearrangement. Our independently
  derived data set from a single institution confirms previous findings of SET-NUP214
  rearrangement, indicates the relatively high incidence of SET-NUP214 rearrangement
  in adult T-ALLs, and also demonstrates comprehensive clinical, phenotypic, and genetic
  characteristics of this entity. Also, our report on genomic breakpoints demonstrates
  the homogeneity in the localization of the genomic breakpoints at 9q34. Concurrent
  chromosomal aberrations identified in this study should provide further areas of
  interest in investigation of SET-NUP214-mediated leukemogenesis.
