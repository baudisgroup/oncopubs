abstract: Invasive cervical carcinoma is thought to arise from cervical intraepithelial
  neoplasm CIN . Genetic changes that occur during progression of CIN to cervical
  carcinoma are poorly understood, although they appear to be directly involved in
  this process. We used comparative genomic hybridization CGH with precise microdissection
  and degenerate oligonucleotide primed-polymerase chain reaction DOP-PCR to detect
  genetic alterations in normal epithelial, CIN, and invasive carcinoma tissues colocalized
  in tumors from 18 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Gains
  on chromosome 1 and on 3q and losses on 2q, 3p, 4, 6p, 11q, and 17p were frequent
  alterations found in CIN and invasive carcinoma lesions. Interestingly, several
  of these genetic changes were observed in preinvasive carcinoma lesions. The frequency
  and average number of genetic alterations corresponded directly to the extent to
  which the cervical carcinoma had progressed. Frequent alterations were found in
  more than 90 of CIN III lesions. Gains on 3q and losses on 11q were the most prevalent
  genetic alterations found in association with uterine cervix carcinogenesis. The
  common regions of alteration were 3q26.1-q28 and 11q23-qter. The majority of tumor
  samples showed variability in genetic alterations across lesion types within a single
  specimen.
