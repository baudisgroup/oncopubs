abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) predisposes to hematologic disorders and myeloid neoplasia
  in childhood and to solid cancers, mainly oral carcinomas, in early adulthood. Few
  cases of solid cancers have been reported in childhood.  We conducted a national
  retrospective study of solid tumors occurring in patients registered with or determined
  to have FA during childhood in France. Phenotypic features, tumor type, cancer treatment,
  and outcome were analyzed. Whenever available, fresh-frozen tumors were analyzed
  by microarray-based comparative genomics hybridization.  We identified eight patients
  with FA with solid tumor from 1986 to 2012. For two patients, the diagnosis of FA
  was unknown at the time of cancer diagnosis. Moreover, we identified one fetus with
  a brain tumor. All patients showed failure to thrive and had dysmorphic features
  and abnormal skin pigmentation. Seven patients had BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations; five
  of these featured more than one malignancy and the median age at the time of cancer
  diagnosis was 11 months (range 0.4-3 years). Solid tumor types included five nephroblastomas,
  two rhabdomyosarcomas, two neuroblastomas, and three brain tumors. Two children
  died from the toxic effects of chemotherapy, two patients from the cancer, and one
  patient from secondary leukemia. Only one BRCA2 patient was alive more than 3 years
  after diagnosis, after tailored chemotherapy.  Solid tumors are rare in FA during
  childhood, except in patients with BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations. The proper genetic diagnosis
  is mandatory to tailor the treatment.  ï¿½ 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
