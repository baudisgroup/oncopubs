abstract: 'We investigated relationships between DNA copy number aberrations and chromosomal
  structural rearrangements in 11 different cell lines derived from oral squamous
  cell carcinoma OSCC by comparative genomic hybridization CGH , spectral karyotyping
  SKY , and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH . CGH frequently showed recurrent
  chromosomal gains of 5p, 20q12, 8q23 approximately qter, 20p11 approximately p12,
  7p15, 11p13 approximately p14, and 14q21, as well as losses of 4q, 18q, 4p11 approximately
  p15, 19p13, 8p21 approximately pter, and 16p11 approximately p12. SKY identified
  the following recurrent chromosomal abnormalities: i 5 p10 , i 5 q10 , i 8 q10 ,
  der X 1 q10 p10 , der 3 5 p10 p10 , and der 3 18 q10 p10 . In addition, breakpoints
  detected by SKY were clustered in 11q13 and around centromeric regions, including
  5p10 q10, 3p10 q10, 8p10 q10 14q10, 1p10 1q10, and 16p10 16q10. Cell lines with
  i 5 p10 and i 8 q10 showed gains of the entire chromosome arms of 5p and 8q by CGH.
  Moreover, breakages near the centromeres of chromosomes 5 and 8 may be associated
  with 5p gain, 8q gain, and 8p loss in OSCC. FISH with a DNA probe from a BAC clone
  mapping to 5p15 showed a significant correlation between the average numbers of
  i 5 p10 and 5p15 R 2 0.8693, P amp lt 0.01 in these cell lines, indicating that
  DNA copy number of 5p depends upon isochromosome formation in OSCC.'
