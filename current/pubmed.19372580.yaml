abstract: Breast cancers can be divided into subtypes with important implications
  for prognosis and treatment. We set out to characterize the genetic alterations
  observed in different breast cancer subtypes and to identify specific candidate
  genes and pathways associated with subtype biology. mRNA expression levels of estrogen
  receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 were shown to predict marker status determined
  by immunohistochemistry and to be effective at assigning samples to subtypes. HER2
  cancers were shown to have the greatest frequency of high-level amplification independent
  of the ERBB2 amplicon itself , but triple-negative cancers had the highest overall
  frequencies of copy gain. Triple-negative cancers also were shown to have more frequent
  loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue and mutation of RB1, which may contribute
  to genomic instability. We identified and validated seven regions of copy number
  alteration associated with different subtypes, and used integrative bioinformatics
  analysis to identify candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including ERBB2,
  GRB7, MYST2, PPM1D, CCND1, HDAC2, FOXA1, and RASA1. We tested the candidate oncogene
  MYST2 and showed that it enhances the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer
  cells. The genome-wide and region-specific differences between subtypes suggest
  the differential activation of oncogenic pathways.
