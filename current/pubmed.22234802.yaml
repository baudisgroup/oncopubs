abstract: "About 50% of children with neuroblastoma (NB) show a metastatic disease
  and have a poor prognosis. However, disease progression is greatly variable and
  depends on patients' age and MYCN oncogene amplification. To investigate the role
  of patients' age in tumor aggressiveness, we performed array-CGH and gene expression
  profiles of three groups (G) of metastatic NBs: G1, stage 4S patients and MYCN single
  copy (MYCN-) tumors; G2, stage 4 patients, â\x89¤ 18 months of age, MYCN- tumors
  and favorable outcome and G3, Stage 4 patients, â\x89¥ 19 months with unfavorable
  outcome. G1 was characterized by numerical aberrations prevalently; on the contrary,
  all G3 tumors had structural rearrangements, whereas G2 showed an intermediate pattern.
  The average of numerical alterations decreased significantly from G1 to G2 to G3
  (p < 0.01). Contrarily, the number of structural aberrations increased from G1 to
  G2 to G3 (p < 2.35 E-05). Noteworthy, G3/MYCN- NBs were characterized by several
  complex intrachromosome rearrangements. Expression analysis of the three groups
  showed significant differences in genes of Rho and Ras signaling pathways, development
  and adhesion, cell cycle regulation and telomerase activity. Accumulation of structural
  alterations increased with patients' age and was associated with a more aggressive
  disease. Abnormal expression of genes involved in cell cycle and telomerase in G3
  may be responsible for the genomic instability in this cohort of patients. The higher
  DNA instability observed in G3/MYCN- NBs than in MYCN-amplified G3 may also explain
  why patients â\x89¥ 19 months have a poor outcome independently by MYCN status.
