abstract: 'About 10 of colorectal carcinoma patients develop pulmonary metastases
  during their lifetime. We address whether and how the chromosomal abnormalities
  differ between the primary cancers and their metastatic counterparts, what the clonality
  relationship CR is between them, and whether certain genomic aberrations contribute
  to this disease progression. Comparative genomic hybridization CGH experiments were
  performed on 18 paired samples of primary and pulmonary metastases obtained from
  patients who had undergone two consecutive surgeries and from whom clinical data
  had been collected. The CGH profiles also were used as indexes for determining the
  CR between the cancers. The overall CGH abnormality profiles were similar for the
  primary colorectal carcinomas and their pulmonary metastases. Frequent gains were
  found on chromosome arms 20q, 8q, 13q, and 7q, whereas common losses were found
  on 18q, 8p, and 18p. The pulmonary metastases, however, contained more CGH abnormalities
  than did the primary carcinomas total aberration events per tumor: 12.6 - 5.0 vs.
  8.3 - 5.7, respectively, P 0.024 gains: 7.6 - 3.1 vs. 5.1 - 3.5, respectively, P
  0.036 losses: 5.0 - 2.8 vs. 3.3 - 2.9, respectively, P 0.076 . Comparing CGH profiles
  between individual primary and metastasis pairs, we found that 10 of the 18 56 paired
  samples examined exhibited a high degree of CR, indicating that they were likely
  to have originated from the same clone and or that not many additional chromosomal
  changes had occurred in the metastases, except for 4q loss, whose incidence was
  much higher in the metastases than in the primaries 60 vs. 10 P 0.030 . Also, the
  primary tumors of the high-CR group carried more genomic aberrations, especially
  8p loss, than did the primary tumors in the low-CR group. We found more chromosomal
  changes associated with the pulmonary metastases of colorectal cancer compared with
  the corresponding primary tumors. We concluded that primary cancers containing more
  genomic lesions, especially 8p losses, are more likely to metastasize to the lungs.
  Loss of 4q is potentially a supplementary factor contributing to the dissemination
  of this disease.'
