abstract: The outcome of treating chronic myeloid leukemia CML with imatinib mesylate
  IM is inferior when therapy is commenced in late chronic or accelerated phase as
  compared to early chronic phase. This may be attributed to additional genomic alterations
  that accumulate during disease progression. We sought to identify such lesions in
  patients showing suboptimal response to IM by performing array-CGH analysis on 39
  sequential samples from 15 CML patients. Seventy-four cumulative copy number alterations
  CNAs consisting of 35 losses and 39 gains were identified. Alterations flanking
  the ABL1 and BCR genes on chromosomes 9 and 22, respectively, were the most common
  identified lesions with 5 patients losing variable portions of 9q34.11 proximal
  to ABL1. Losses involving 1p36, 5q31, 17q25, Y and gains of 3q21, 8q24, 22q11, Xp11
  were among other recurrent lesions identified. Aberrations were also observed in
  individual patients, involving regions containing known leukemia-associated genes
  CDKN2A 2B, IKZF1, RB1, TLX1, AFF4. CML patients in late stages of their disease,
  harbor pre-existing and evolving sub-microscopic CNAs that may influence disease
  progression and IM response.
