abstract: This study attempted to analyze the prognostic role of single nucleotide
  polymorphism array SNP-A -based karyotying in 133 patients with acute myeloid leukemia
  with normal karyotype AML-NK , which presents with diverse clinical outcomes, thus
  requiring further stratification of patient subgroups according to their prognoses.
