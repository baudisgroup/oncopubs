abstract: Aberrations of the Insulin-like Growth Factor IGF system have been found
  in association with a variety of cancer types. The potential role of IGF1R has been
  postulated in a small subset of GISTs, but until now the implications of its aberrations
  have not been defined. The aim of the study was to examine the IGF1R status in patients
  with gastric GIST in regard to KIT and PDGFRA genotype. Fresh resection specimens
  were collected from 8 primary tumours 2 wild-type WT and 6 mutant cases . IGF1R
  was studied as gene expression profiling with Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133Plus 2.0
  arrays and as genomic copy number with SNP array analysis Affymetrix Genome Wide
  Human SNP 6.0 arrays, and at protein level with western blotting WB and immunohistochemistry
  IHC . The unsupervised analysis of gene expression profiling of our patients merged
  with a data set from gastric GISTs identified 2 patients out of 8 with different
  expression of IGF1R. The data were confirmed by WB and IHC. In particular, IGF1R
  was upregulated in 2 young patients amp lt 30-years old , who had both WT disease
  and metastases at diagnosis. The SNP array analysis showed that none of the tumours
  had IGF1R amplification. GISTs are characterized by abnormalities of the KIT and
  PDGFRA receptors that affect prognosis and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
  Both young adult with WT GIST had the over-expression of IGF1R at mRNA and protein
  level. These results further confirm the hypothesis that IGF1R may be a potential
  therapeutic target in GISTs lacking KIT and PDGFRA mutations.
