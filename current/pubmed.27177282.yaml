abstract: This study aimed to perform an integrative genetic analysis of patients
  with matched serous ovarian cancer having long-term or short-term survival using
  formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.  All patients with serous
  ovarian carcinoma who underwent surgery between 1998 and 2007 at the Department
  of Gynaecology, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden were considered. From this cohort,
  we selected biomaterial from 2 groups of patients with long-term and short-term
  survival matched for age, stage, histologic grade, and outcome of surgery. Genomic
  DNA from FFPE sample was analyzed with SNP array and targeted next-generation sequencing
  of 26 genes.  Forty-three samples (primary tumors and metastases) from 23 patients
  were selected for genomic profiling, the survival in the subgroups were 134 and
  36 months, respectively. We observed a tendency toward increased genomic instability
  in those with long-term survival with higher proportion of somatic copy number alterations
  (P = 0.083) and higher average ploidy (P = 0.037). TP53 mutations were found in
  50% of the patients. Frequency of TP53 mutations did not differ between the survival
  groups (P = 0.629).  We validated both previous genomic findings in ovarian cancer
  and the proposed association between increased genomic instability and better survival.
  These results exemplify that analysis of genomic biomarkers is feasible on archived
  FFPE tissue.
