abstract: Endometrial carcinoma shows various histological types that differ in their
  clinical presentation and prognosis. Comparative genomic hybridization was used
  to detect gains and losses of DNA sequences along all chromosome arms in 24 uterine
  serous and 24 uterine endometrioid carcinomas. In serous carcinomas, extensive genetic
  aberrations were detected in 17 of the 24 specimens, with a mean of 5.7 changes
  per tumor. The most frequent gains occurred at 3q 50 , 8q 33 , 5p 29 , 6p 29 , and
  1q 29 , and the most common losses were located at 4q 17 , 15q 17 , and 18q 17 .
  Tumors exhibiting DNA copy number changes were associated with shorter overall survival.
  In endometrioid carcinomas, genetic aberrations were less frequent and simpler than
  in serous carcinomas. DNA sequence copy number changes were observed in 12 of the
  24 cases, with a mean of 1.5 changes per tumor. The most frequent aberrations were
  gains at 1q 29 , 2q 13 , and 8q 13 . Losses were rarely observed. The diverging
  pattern of genetic changes observed in uterine serous and endometrioid carcinomas
  suggests different pathways of carcinogenesis in these tumor types.
