abstract: A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is
  to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here
  we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations SCNAs from
  3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify
  158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several
  cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer
  target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among
  these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and
  the NF-kappaBeta pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding
  the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes
  for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified
  in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.
