abstract: We investigated chromosomal aberrations in 16 patients with astrocytic tumors
  of various histologic malignancies by comparative genomic hybridization CGH . The
  degree of chromosomal loss was shown to be negatively correlated with histologic
  malignancy. Losses of portions of chromosomes 1p, 19q and 22q were the three chromosomal
  aberrations observed most frequently. Alterations in multiple chromosomes were observed
  more frequently in glioblastomas than in astrocytomas or anaplastic astrocytomas
  P amp lt 0.001 . Primary glioblastomas showed a high frequency of genomic DNA gains
  5 7 , whereas recurrent glioblastomas from anaplastic astrocytomas did not 0 3 .
  We found CGH to be a powerful tool for surveying DNA alterations in tumors and characterizing
  the biology of tumors of astrocytic lineage.
