abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH was used to screen 42 wood dust-related
  sinonasal adenocarcinomas for chromosomal alterations. The tumour collection comprised
  39 papillary-tubular cylinder cell adenocarcinomas PTCCs six cases G1, 23 G2, and
  ten G3 , two alveolar goblet cell adenocarcinomas AGCs , and one signet ring cell
  adenocarcinoma SRC , according to the Kleinsasser and Schroeder classification.
  Copy number changes were detected in 41 tumours 97.6 . The one carcinoma without
  imbalances was a PTCC-G1. DNA gains were most frequently seen on chromosomes 12p
  83 , 7q 74 , 8q 71 , and 20q 71 , 11q 61 , 22 59 , and 1q 52 . Pronounced overrepresentations
  suggestive of high copy amplifications were detected on 8q 15 cases, 36 , 7q six
  cases, 14 , 20q five cases, 12 , 13q14 three cases, 7 , 1q22, 5p, 12p and 20 two
  cases, 5 each , and 2q24, 3q13, 3q22, 7p, 14q12, and 16q13 one case, each 2 . Frequent
  chromosomal losses occurred at 5q 81 , 18q 76 , 4 74 , 8p 61 , 9p 60 , 6q and 17p
  52 each , and 3p, 13q, and 21 50 each . There was a quantitative as well as a qualitative
  increase of alterations from PTCC-G1 to PTCC-G2 and finally PTCC-G3, confirming
  the usefulness of histopathological grading. While PTCC-G1 carried only a few alterations,
  namely gains on chromosomes 17 and 7 as well as losses of 4q and 13q, PTCC-G2 already
  carried many of the above-mentioned alterations, while PTCC-G3 showed significantly
  more gains of 7q, 8q, and 12p, and losses of 8p and 17p. Additionally, the latter
  subgroup was particularly prone to carry pronounced DNA gains. These data provide
  further evidence for a recurrent pattern of chromosomal imbalances in sinonasal
  adenocarcinomas and highlight distinct aberrations that are associated with tumour
  differentiation and progression.
