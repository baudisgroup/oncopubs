abstract: Cytogenetic investigations of bladder cancer suggested that development
  and progression is characterized by specific chromosomal aberrations. In order to
  identify genetic changes linked to muscle invasive tumors and metastatic growth
  we analyzed 67 bladder carcinomas 30 pT1 and 37 pT2-4 by means of comparative genomic
  hybridization CGH . The most frequent changes were gains of chromosome 1q 54 , 8q
  54 , 17q 49 , 2p 30 , 12 30 , 5p 25 , 3q 24 and 6p 24 as well as losses of 11p 43
  , 8p 42 , 9p 36 , 11q 34 , 2q, 4q, 5q 30 each , 9q 27 and 10q 27 . Previously not
  described amplifications were found at 5p11-p13, 7q21-q31, 9p24 and 17q24-q25. Gains
  of 3q, 7p, and 18p were markedly more frequent in pT2-4 in comparison to pT1 carcinomas
  but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Non-metastatic tumors
  showed more aberrations on average than metastatic carcinomas, although no particular
  change was found to be predominating in either group. Our data confirm previous
  findings of strong genetic similarities between minimally and deeply invasive bladder
  carcinomas but argue for differences between metastatic and non-metastatic disease.
