abstract: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and marginal zone lymphomas of nodal, extra-nodal
  and splenic types account for 10% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. They are similar at
  the cell differentiation level, sometimes making difficult to distinguish them from
  other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. To better characterize their genetic basis,
  we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 101 marginal zone
  lymphomas (46 MALT, 35 splenic and 20 nodal marginal zone lymphomas) and 13 lymphoplasmacytic
  lymphomas. Overall, 90% exhibited copy-number abnormalities. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas
  demonstrated the most complex karyotype (median=7 copy-number abnormalities), followed
  by MALT (4), nodal (3.5) and splenic marginal zone lymphomas (3). A comparative
  analysis exposed a group of copy-number abnormalities shared by several or all the
  entities with few disease-specific abnormalities. Gain of chromosomes 3, 12 and
  18 and loss of 6q23-q24 (TNFAIP3) were identified in all entities. Losses of 13q14.3
  (MIRN15A-MIRN16-1) and 17p13.3-p12 (TP53) were found in lymphoplasmacytic and splenic
  marginal zone lymphomas; loss of 11q21-q22 (ATM) was found in nodal, splenic marginal
  zone and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and loss of 7q32.1-q33 was found in MALT, splenic
  and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. Abnormalities affecting the nuclear factor kappa
  B pathway were observed in 70% of MALT and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and 30% of
  splenic and nodal marginal zone lymphomas, suggesting distinct roles of this pathway
  in the pathogenesis/progression of these subtypes. Elucidation of the genetic alterations
  contributing to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas may guide to design-specific
  therapeutic approaches.
