abstract: Genomic alterations were analyzed in 21 uterine leiomyosarcomas ULMSs by
  comparative genomic hybridization. DNA copy number changes were detected in all
  21 tumors. The most frequent losses were 13q 16 21 76 , 10q 13 21 62 , 16q 8 21
  38 , 12p 7 21 33 , and 2p 9 21 43 . The most common gains were 17p 8 21 38 , Xp
  7 21 33 , and 1q 7 21 33 . High-copy-number gains ratio amp gt 1.5 were identified
  in Xp, 1q, and 17p. Loss of 13q was identified in both low-grade and high-grade
  tumors. Inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene in 13q may be an early event in
  the development of leiomyosarcomas. Loss of 10q, 2p, and 12p and gains of 1q as
  well as 17p were frequently found in high-grade tumors and recurrent tumors. Inactivation
  of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes in these regions may be associated
  with a more aggressive behavior of ULMS. Patients with only loss of 13q and without
  the other alterations listed above had longer survival times. Gains of Xp, 17p,
  and 1q and losses of 13q, 10q, 16q, 12p, and 2p have been reported in extra-uterine
  leiomyosarcomas. Our findings indicate that the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyosarcomas
  and extra-uterine leiomyosarcomas follows the same genetic pathways.
