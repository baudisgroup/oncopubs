abstract: Genomic DNA copy number alterations are key genetic events in the development
  and progression of human cancers. Here we report a genome-wide microarray comparative
  genomic hybridization array CGH analysis of DNA copy number variation in a series
  of primary human breast tumors. We have profiled DNA copy number alteration across
  6,691 mapped human genes, in 44 predominantly advanced, primary breast tumors and
  10 breast cancer cell lines. While the overall patterns of DNA amplification and
  deletion corroborate previous cytogenetic studies, the high-resolution gene-by-gene
  mapping of amplicon boundaries and the quantitative analysis of amplicon shape provide
  significant improvement in the localization of candidate oncogenes. Parallel microarray
  measurements of mRNA levels reveal the remarkable degree to which variation in gene
  copy number contributes to variation in gene expression in tumor cells. Specifically,
  we find that 62 of highly amplified genes show moderately or highly elevated expression,
  that DNA copy number influences gene expression across a wide range of DNA copy
  number alterations deletion, low-, mid- and high-level amplification , that on average,
  a 2-fold change in DNA copy number is associated with a corresponding 1.5-fold change
  in mRNA levels, and that overall, at least 12 of all the variation in gene expression
  among the breast tumors is directly attributable to underlying variation in gene
  copy number. These findings provide evidence that widespread DNA copy number alteration
  can lead directly to global deregulation of gene expression, which may contribute
  to the development or progression of cancer.
