abstract: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands
  and is rarely associated with concurrent epithelial malignancy, which is designated
  as carcinoma in pleomorphic adenoma CPA . Genetic abnormalities potentially related
  to the development of CPA have not been fully investigated. We analyzed DNA copy
  number changes in each of the adenomatous and carcinomatous components of seven
  CPA by comparative genomic hybridization using DNA extracted from microdissected
  tissues of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Carcinomatous components
  of CPA showed multiple DNA copy number changes at 1-18 different genomic sites mean
  13 sites . Adenomatous components displayed less frequent DNA copy number changes
  0-13 sites mean, 5 . In both components, the majority of the changes were gains.
  The most common recurrent gains in carcinomatous components were seen at 6q four
  cases in each , whereas gains at 13q1-2 and 15q1 were most frequently detected in
  adenomatous components three cases in each . In five CPA, the same chromosomal regions
  were involved in the DNA copy number changes detected in both components. Our data
  suggest that an accumulated or increased number of chromosomal changes including
  6q abnormalities may be associated with the development of carcinomatous components
  in a subset of CPA.
