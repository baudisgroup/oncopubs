abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumor of bone. It is a highly vascular
  and extremely destructive malignancy that mainly affects children and young adults.
  The authors conducted microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and
  pathway analyses to gain a systemic view of pathway alterations in the genetically
  altered genes.
