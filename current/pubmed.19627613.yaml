abstract: 'Oral cancer develops through a series of histopathological stages: through
  mild low grade , moderate, and severe high grade dysplasia to carcinoma in situ
  and then invasive disease. Early detection of those oral premalignant lesions OPLs
  that will develop into invasive tumors is necessary to improve the poor prognosis
  of oral cancer. Because no tools exist for delineating progression risk in low grade
  oral lesions, we cannot determine which of these cases require aggressive intervention.
  We undertook whole genome analysis by tiling-path array comparative genomic hybridization
  for a rare panel of early and late stage OPLs n 62 , all of which had extensive
  longitudinal follow up amp gt 10 years . Genome profiles for oral squamous cell
  carcinomas n 24 were generated for comparison. Parallel analysis of genome alterations
  and clinical parameters was performed to identify features associated with disease
  progression. Genome alterations in low grade dysplasias progressing to invasive
  disease more closely resembled those observed for later stage disease than they
  did those observed for non-progressing low grade dysplasias. This was despite the
  histopathological similarity between progressing and non-progressing cases. Strikingly,
  unbiased computational analysis of genomic alteration data correctly classified
  nearly all progressing low grade dysplasia cases. Our data demonstrate that high
  resolution genomic analysis can be used to evaluate progression risk in low grade
  OPLs, a marked improvement over present histopathological approaches which cannot
  delineate progression risk. Taken together, our data suggest that whole genome technologies
  could be used in management strategies for patients presenting with precancerous
  oral lesions.'
