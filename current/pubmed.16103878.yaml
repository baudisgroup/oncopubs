abstract: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization CGH-array has a powerful potential
  for high-throughput identification of genetic aberrations in cell genomes. We identified
  a homozygous loss of ADAM23 2q33.3 in the course of a program to screen a panel
  of gastric cancer GC cell lines 1 32, 3.1 for genomic copy-number aberrations using
  our custom-made CGH-array. Infrequent homozygous deletion of ADAM23 was also seen
  in primary gastric tumors 1 39, 2.6 . ADAM23 mRNA was expressed in normal stomach
  tissue, but not in the majority of GC cell lines without homozygous deletion of
  this gene. Expression of ADAM23 mRNA was restored to gene-silenced GC cells after
  treatment with 5-aza 2-deoxycytidine. The methylation status of the ADAM23 CpG island,
  which showed promoter activity, correlated inversely with its expression. Methylation
  of this CpG island was observed both in GC cell lines and in primary GC tissues
  in primary tumors with a hypermethylated CpG island, expression of ADAM23 was lower
  than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Moreover, restoration of ADAM23 in GC cells
  reduced their numbers in colony-formation assays. These results suggest that genetic
  or epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of the ADAM23 CpG-rich promoter region
  leads to loss of ADAM23 function, which may be a factor in gastric carcinogenesis.
