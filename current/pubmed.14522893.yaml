abstract: 'Cancer cells progress through the accumulation of genetic alterations.
  Familial adenomatous polyposis FAP tumors provide an excellent model to unravel
  the molecular steps underlying malignant transformation. Global genomic damage was
  assessed in 56 adenomas and 3 carcinomas from six FAP patients and compared with
  that of sporadic adenomas and carcinomas. Evolutive trees were traced after application
  of maximum likelihood clustering and split decomposition methods to the analysis
  of comprehensive genetic profiles generated by diverse molecular approaches: arbitrarily
  primed PCR, comparative genomic hybridization, and flow cytometry. Overall, genomic
  damage as assessed by arbitrarily primed PCR was lower in familial adenomas than
  in sporadic adenomas and carcinomas. Comparative genomic hybridization data also
  show a low number of alterations in the majority of FAP adenomas. Tumors of the
  same patient were likely to share specific genetic alterations and may be grouped
  into one or two clusters. Putative common pathways were also identified, which included
  tumors of up to three different patients. According to our data, FAP tumors accumulate
  specific genetic alterations and in a preferred order that is characteristic of
  each individual. Moreover, the particular genetic background and environmental conditions
  of a FAP patient restrain the molecular evolution portrait of synchronous tumors.'
