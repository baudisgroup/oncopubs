abstract: Mantle-cell lymphoma MCL is genetically characterized by 11q13 chromosomal
  translocations involving the CCND1 gene. We have characterized five MCL cell lines,
  JVM-2, GRANTA-519, REC-1, JEKO-1, and NCEB-1, combining metaphase and array comparative
  genomic hybridization, multicolor-FISH, and molecular analysis. Our results revealed
  common gained regions at 2p14, 9q31.2-qter, 11q13.1-q21, 13q14-q21.2, 13q34-qter
  and 18q21.1-q22.1, and losses at 1p21.2-p31.1, 2p11.2, 8p21.2-pter, 9p21.3-pter,
  11q23.3-qter, 17p11.2-pter, and 17q21.2-q22.2. All cell lines except JVM-2, displayed
  moderate or high numerical chromosome instability. In addition, an ongoing level
  of chromosome rearrangements was observed in REC-1. Surprisingly, NCEB-1 carried
  several stable mouse chromosomes and showed expression of both human and murine
  bcl-2 protein. Our findings indicate that these cell lines represent three patterns
  of chromosome evolution in MCL and may be useful to understand the pathogenesis
  of this neoplasm.
