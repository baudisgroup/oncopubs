abstract: Multiple myeloma MM develops from a premalignant plasma cell proliferative
  disorder, and with time can progress to a more aggressive disease in extramedullary
  locations. The gradually clinical evolution is supported by clonal expansion of
  cells that acquire genetic lesions over years. This model of cancer evolution based
  on ongoing genomic instability mechanism may apply to development of most MM cases.
  However, in a small fraction of newly diagnosed MM who relapse quickly and finally
  die within 2 years, the gradual model appears to be untenable. Analysis of high
  resolution copy number profiles obtained using single nucleotide polymorphism array
  data from 764 newly diagnosed MM identified large numbers of genomic rearrangements
  with the hallmarks of chromothripsis in 1.3 of samples. Moreover, this catastrophic
  event confers a poor outcome. Because chromothripsis appears to occur in a single
  crisis, our results suggest that high-risk MM patients use this novel way of cancer
  evolution.
