abstract: The mechanisms underlying the progression from ductal carcinoma in situ
  DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma IDC of the breast are yet to be fully elucidated.
  Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the progression from DCIS to
  IDC, including the selection of a subpopulation of cancer cells with specific genetic
  aberrations, and the acquisition of new genetic aberrations or non-genetic mechanisms
  mediated by the tumour microenvironment. To determine whether synchronously diagnosed
  ipsilateral DCI and IDCs have modal populations with distinct repertoires of gene
  copy number aberrations and mutations in common oncogenes, matched frozen samples
  of DCIS and IDC were retrieved from 13 patients and subjected to microarray-based
  comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and Sequenom MassARRAY Oncocarta v 1.0 panel
  . Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Sanger sequencing were employed to validate
  the aCGH and Sequenom findings, respectively. Although the genomic profiles of matched
  DCI and IDCs were similar, in three of 13 matched pairs amplification of distinct
  loci ie 1q41, 2q24.2, 6q22.31, 7q11.21, 8q21.2 and 9p13.3 was either restricted
  to, or more prevalent in, the modal population of cancer cells of one of the components.
  Sequenom MassARRAY identified PIK3CA mutations restricted to the DCIS component
  in two cases, and in a third case the frequency of the PIK3CA mutant allele reduced
  from 49 in the DCIS to 25 in the IDC component. Despite the genomic similarities
  between synchronous DCIS and IDC, our data provide strong circumstantial evidence
  to suggest that in some cases the progression from DCIS to IDC is driven by the
  selection of non-modal clones that harbour a specific repertoire of genetic aberrations.
