abstract: Ovarian cancer is one of the most frequent gynecological malignancies worldwide
  with a poor prognosis. Comparative genomic hybridization has been applied to detect
  recurrent chromosome alterations in 31 primary ovarian carcinomas in Chinese women.
  Several nonrandom chromosomal changes were identified including gains of 3q 17 cases,
  55 with a minimum region at 3q25 through q26, 8q 16 cases, 52 , 19q 12 cases, 39
  , Xq 11 cases, 35 , 1q 10 cases, 32 , 12p12 through q13 10 cases, 32 , 17q 10 cases,
  32 with a minimum gain region at 17q21, and 20q 9 cases, 29 and losses of 16q 9
  cases, 29 , 1p 7 cases, 23 , 18q 7 cases, 23 , and 22 7 cases, 23 . High-copy-number
  amplification was detected in eleven cases. Amplification of 3q25 through q26 was
  detected in four cases, and amplifications of 8q24 and 12p11.2 through q12 were
  observed in three cases each. The recurrent gains and losses of chromosomal regions
  identified in this study provide candidate regions that may contain oncogenes or
  tumor suppressor genes involved in the development and progression of ovarian cancer.
