abstract: Comparative genomic hybridization CGH studies have provided a wealth of
  information on common copy number aberrations in pancreatic cancer, but the genes
  affected by these aberrations are largely unknown. To identify putative amplification
  target genes in pancreatic cancer, we performed a parallel copy number and expression
  survey in 13 pancreatic cancer cell lines using a 12,232-clone cDNA microarray,
  providing an average resolution of 300 kb throughout the human genome. CGH on cDNA
  microarray allowed highly accurate mapping of copy number increases and resulted
  in identification of 24 independent amplicons, ranging in size from 130 kb to 11
  Mb. Statistical evaluation of gene copy number and expression data across all 13
  cell lines revealed a set of 105 genes whose elevated expression levels were directly
  attributable to increased copy number. These included genes previously reported
  to be amplified in cancer as well as several novel targets for copy number alterations,
  such as p21-activated kinase 4 PAK4 , which was previously shown to be involved
  in cell migration, cell adhesion, and anchorage-independent growth. In conclusion,
  our results implicate a set of 105 genes that is likely to be actively involved
  in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer.
