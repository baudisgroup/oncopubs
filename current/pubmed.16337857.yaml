abstract: Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death among women with gynecological
  malignancies in western Europe. The high mortality rate is largely due to drug resistance.
  It is thus essential to increase knowledge and understanding of the underlying mechanisms
  of chemotherapy resistance, which might be caused by changes in the tumor genome.
  After surgery, carboplatin is the standard treatment for patients with early-stage
  ovarian cancer. Using comparative genomic hybridization CGH , we explored cytogenetic
  alterations in 63 early-stage epithelial ovarian tumors, comparing the aberration
  patterns in the carboplatin-resistant and carboplatin-sensitive tumors. Several
  chromosomal regions were more frequently altered in the resistant tumors some of
  these differences were statistically significant. We also found differences in tumor
  histology. Gains of 1q, 5q14 approximately q23, and 13q21 approximately q32, and
  losses of 8p and 9q were associated with clinical carboplatin resistance. Also,
  differences were found between the primary resistant and the secondary resistant
  tumors. Our findings demonstrate biologic observations of clinical drug resistance
  and specifically reveal chromosomal regions of interest for platinum resistance.
