abstract: "Recent technological advances have made it possible to detect circulating
  tumor cells (CTCs) as a prognostic marker in operable breast cancer patients. Whether
  the presence of CTCs in cancer patients correlates with molecular alterations in
  the primary tumor has not been widely explored. We identified 14 primary breast
  cancer specimens with known CTC status, in order to evaluate the presence of differential
  genetic aberrations by using SNP array assay. There was a global increase of altered
  genome, CNA, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cn-LOH) observed in the CTC-positive
  (CTC(+)) versus CTC-negative (CTC(-)) cases. As the preliminary results showed a
  higher proportion of copy number alteration (CNA) at 8q24 (MYC loci) and the available
  evidence supporting the role of MYC in the processes cancer metastases is conflicting,
  MYC status was determined in tissue microarray sections in a larger series of patients
  (nâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x8949) with known CTC status using FISH. MYC was altered in 62%
  (16/26) CTC(+) patients and in 43% (6/14) CTC(-) patients (pâ\x80\x89=â\x80\x890.25).
  Based on the observation in our study, future studies involving a larger number
  of patients should be performed in order to definitively define if this correlation
  exists."
