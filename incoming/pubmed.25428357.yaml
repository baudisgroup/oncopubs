abstract: Somatic copy number aberrations (CNA) represent a mutation type encountered
  in the majority of cancer genomes. Here, we present the 2014 edition of arrayMap
  (http://www.arraymap.org), a publicly accessible collection of pre-processed oncogenomic
  array data sets and CNA profiles, representing a vast range of human malignancies.
  Since the initial release, we have enhanced this resource both in content and especially
  with regard to data mining support. The 2014 release of arrayMap contains more than
  64,000 genomic array data sets, representing about 250 tumor diagnoses. Data sets
  included in arrayMap have been assembled from public repositories as well as additional
  resources, and integrated by applying custom processing pipelines. Online tools
  have been upgraded for a more flexible array data visualization, including options
  for processing user provided, non-public data sets. Data integration has been improved
  by mapping to multiple editions of the human reference genome, with the majority
  of the data now being available for the UCSC hg18 as well as GRCh37 versions. The
  large amount of tumor CNA data in arrayMap can be freely downloaded by users to
  promote data mining projects, and to explore special events such as chromothripsis-like
  genome patterns.  ï¿½ The Author(s) 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on
