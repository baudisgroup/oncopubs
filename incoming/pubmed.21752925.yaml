abstract: DNA amplification, particularly of chromosomes 8 and 11, occurs frequently
  in breast cancer and is a key factor in tumorigenesis, often associated with poor
  prognosis. The mechanisms involved in the amplification of these regions are not
  fully understood. Studies from model systems have demonstrated that palindrome formation
  can be an early step in DNA amplification, most notably seen in the breakage-fusion-bridge
  (BFB) cycle. Therefore, palindromes might be associated with gene amplicons in breast
  cancer. To address this possibility, we coupled high-resolution palindrome profiling
  by the Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation (GAPF) assay with genome-wide
  copy-number analyses on a set of breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors to
  spatially associate palindromes and copy-number gains. We identified GAPF-positive
  regions distributed nonrandomly throughout cell line and tumor genomes, often in
  clusters, and associated with copy-number gains. Commonly amplified regions in breast
  cancer, chromosomes 8q and 11q, had GAPF-positive regions flanking and throughout
  the copy-number gains. We also identified amplification-associated GAPF-positive
  regions at similar locations in subsets of breast cancers with similar characteristics
  (e.g., ERBB2 amplification). These shared positive regions offer the potential to
  evaluate the utility of palindromes as prognostic markers, particularly in premalignant
  breast lesions. Our results implicate palindrome formation in the amplification
  of regions with key roles in breast tumorigenesis, particularly in subsets of breast
  cancers.
