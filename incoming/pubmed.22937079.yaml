abstract: Regional genomic copy number alterations (CNA) are observed in the vast
  majority of cancers. Besides specifically targeting well-known, canonical oncogenes,
  CNAs may also play more subtle roles in terms of modulating genetic potential and
  broad gene expression patterns of developing tumors. Any significant differences
  in the overall CNA patterns between different cancer types may thus point towards
  specific biological mechanisms acting in those cancers. In addition, differences
  among CNA profiles may prove valuable for cancer classifications beyond existing
  annotation systems.  We have analyzed molecular-cytogenetic data from 25579 tumors
  samples, which were classified into 160 cancer types according to the International
  Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system. When correcting for differences in
  the overall CNA frequencies between cancer types, related cancers were often found
  to cluster together according to similarities in their CNA profiles. Based on a
  randomization approach, distance measures from the cluster dendrograms were used
  to identify those specific genomic regions that contributed significantly to this
  signal. This approach identified 43 non-neutral genomic regions whose propensity
  for the occurrence of copy number alterations varied with the type of cancer at
  hand. Only a subset of these identified loci overlapped with previously implied,
  highly recurrent (hot-spot) cytogenetic imbalance regions.  Thus, for many genomic
  regions, a simple null-hypothesis of independence between cancer type and relative
  copy number alteration frequency can be rejected. Since a subset of these regions
  display relatively low overall CNA frequencies, they may point towards second-tier
  genomic targets that are adaptively relevant but not necessarily essential for cancer
  development.
