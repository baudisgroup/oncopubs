abstract: "Recommendations by the International Society of Urologic Pathology and
  2016 World Health Organization blue book propose the use of a five-tiered prostate
  cancer (PCa) grading system. The five prognostic grade groupings (PGGs) ranging
  from 1 to 5 are defined as Gleason grades â\x89¤ 6, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, and > 8, respectively.
  Recent work suggests that each group is associated with a distinct risk of biochemical
  PCa recurrence. In this study, we sought genomic support for PGGs using whole-exome
  and whole-genome sequencing data for 426 clinically localized PCas treated by radical
  prostatectomy. After adjustment for tumor purity for the sequencing data, we observed
  a significant frequency increase in genomic amplifications and deletions (p = 0.013)
  and in nonsynonymous point mutations (p = 0.008) with increasing risk group. Interestingly,
  PGG1 (low risk) was entirely haploid, whereas PGG2-5 exhibited increasing polyploidy
  frequency. Principal component analysis of genomic profiles revealed that PGG1,
  PGG2, and PGG3 represent distinct classes, but PGG4 and PGG5 exhibit genomic similarity.
  Together, these observations for the largest PCa genomic data set to date provide
  support for increasing genomic alterations with increasing PGG. This is the first
  genomic correlation of the PGG system. Future work will need to explore the clinical
  utility of PGGs in prospective studies with long-term follow-up.Gleason grading
  for prostate cancer provides important information for guiding clinical care. A
  new proposal by leading pathologists favors translating Gleason grades into five
  risk categories. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the largest genomic
  data set on prostate cancer to date, we demonstrate molecular support for this new
  five-tiered system."
