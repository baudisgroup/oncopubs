abstract: "BACKGROUND: Prognostic biomarkers are needed for superficial gastroesophageal
  adenocarcinoma (EAC) to predict clinical outcomes and select therapy. Although recurrent
  mutations have been characterized in EAC, little is known about their clinical and
  prognostic significance. Aneuploidy is predictive of clinical outcome in many malignancies
  but has not been evaluated in superficial EAC. METHODS: We quantified copy number
  changes in 41 superficial EAC using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays. We identified recurrent
  chromosomal gains and losses and calculated the total copy number abnormality (CNA)
  count for each tumor as a measure of aneuploidy. We correlated CNA count with overall
  survival and time to first recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS:
  Recurrent segmental gains and losses involved multiple genes, including: HER2, EGFR,
  MET, CDK6, KRAS (recurrent gains); and FHIT, WWOX, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, RUNX1 (recurrent
  losses). There was a 40-fold variation in CNA count across all cases. Tumors with
  the lowest and highest quartile CNA count had significantly better overall survival
  (p창\x80\x8A=창\x80\x8A0.032) and time to first recurrence (p창\x80\x8A=창\x80\x8A0.010)
  compared to those with intermediate CNA counts. These associations persisted when
  controlling for other prognostic variables. SIGNIFICANCE: SNP arrays facilitate
  the assessment of recurrent chromosomal gain and loss and allow high resolution,
  quantitative assessment of segmental aneuploidy (total CNA count). The non-monotonic
  association of segmental aneuploidy with survival has been described in other tumors.
  The degree of aneuploidy is a promising prognostic biomarker in a potentially curable
  form of EAC."
