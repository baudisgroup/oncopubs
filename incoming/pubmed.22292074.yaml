abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone. The tumours
  are characterized by high genomic instability, including the occurrence of multiple
  regions of amplifications and deletions. Chromosome region 17p11.2-p12 is amplified
  in about 25% of cases. In previous studies, COPS3 and PMP22 have been identified
  as candidate oncogenes in this region. Considering the complexity and variation
  of the amplification profiles for this segment, the involvement of additional causative
  oncogenes is to be expected. The aim of the present investigation is to identify
  novel candidate oncogenes in 17p11.2-p12. We selected 26 of in total 85 osteosarcoma
  samples (31%) with amplification events in 17p11.2-p12, using quantitative PCR for
  8 marker genes. These were subjected to high-resolution SNP array analysis and subsequent
  GISTIC analysis to identify the most significantly amplified regions. Two major
  amplification peaks were found in the 17p11.2-p12 region. Overexpression as a consequence
  of gene amplification is a major mechanism for oncogene activation in tumours. Therefore,
  to identify the causative oncogenes, we next determined expression levels of all
  genes within the two segments using expression array data that could be generated
  for 20 of the selected samples. We identified 11 genes that were overexpressed through
  amplification in at least 50% of cases. Nine of these, c17orf39, RICH2, c17orf45,
  TOP3A, COPS3, SHMT1, PRPSAP2, PMP22, and RASD1, demonstrated a significant association
  between copy number and expression level. We conclude that these genes, including
  COPS3 and PMP22, are candidate oncogenes in 17p11.2-p12 of importance in osteosarcoma
  tumourigenesis.
