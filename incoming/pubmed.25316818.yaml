abstract: Low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (LGSC) are Ras pathway-mutated, TP53
  wild-type, and frequently associated with borderline tumors. Patients with LGSCs
  respond poorly to platinum-based chemotherapy and may benefit from pathway-targeted
  agents. High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) are TP53-mutated and are thought to
  be rarely associated with borderline tumors. We sought to determine whether borderline
  histology associated with grade 2 or 3 carcinoma was an indicator of Ras mutation,
  and we explored the molecular relationship between coexisting invasive and borderline
  histologies.We reviewed >1,200 patients and identified 102 serous carcinomas with
  adjacent borderline regions for analyses, including candidate mutation screening,
  copy number, and gene expression profiling.We found a similar frequency of low,
  moderate, and high-grade carcinomas with coexisting borderline histology. BRAF/KRAS
  alterations were common in LGSC; however, we also found recurrent NRAS mutations.
  Whereas borderline tumors harbored BRAF/KRAS mutations, NRAS mutations were restricted
  to carcinomas, representing the first example of a Ras oncogene with an obligatory
  association with invasive serous cancer. Coexisting borderline and invasive components
  showed nearly identical genomic profiles. Grade 2 cases with coexisting borderline
  included tumors with molecular features of LGSC, whereas others were typical of
  HGSC. However, all grade 3 carcinomas with coexisting borderline histology were
  molecularly indistinguishable from typical HGSC.Our findings suggest that NRAS is
  an oncogenic driver in serous ovarian tumors. We demonstrate that borderline histology
  is an unreliable predictor of Ras pathway aberration and underscore an important
  role for molecular classification in identifying patients that may benefit from
  targeted agents.
