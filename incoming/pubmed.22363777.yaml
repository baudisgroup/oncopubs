abstract: In colorectal cancer (CRC), chromosomal instability (CIN) is typically studied
  using comparative-genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. We studied paired (tumor and
  surrounding healthy) fresh frozen tissue from 86 CRC patients using Illumina's Infinium-based
  SNP array. This method allowed us to study CIN in CRC, with simultaneous analysis
  of copy number (CN) and B-allele frequency (BAF)--a representation of allelic composition.
  These data helped us to detect mono-allelic and bi-allelic amplifications/deletion,
  copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and levels of mosaicism for mixed cell populations,
  some of which can not be assessed with other methods that do not measure BAF. We
  identified associations between CN abnormalities and different CRC phenotypes (histological
  diagnosis, location, tumor grade, stage, MSI and presence of lymph node metastasis).
  We showed commonalities between regions of CN change observed in CRC and the regions
  reported in previous studies of other solid cancers (e.g. amplifications of 20q,
  13q, 8q, 5p and deletions of 18q, 17p and 8p). From Therapeutic Target Database,
  we identified relevant drugs, targeted to the genes located in these regions with
  CN changes, approved or in trials for other cancers and common diseases. These drugs
  may be considered for future therapeutic trials in CRC, based on personalized cytogenetic
  diagnosis. We also found many regions, harboring genes, which are not currently
  targeted by any relevant drugs that may be considered for future drug discovery
  studies. Our study shows the application of high density SNP arrays for cytogenetic
  study in CRC and its potential utility for personalized treatment.
