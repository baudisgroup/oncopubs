abstract: Differentiation arrest is a hallmark of acute leukemia. Genomic alterations
  in B cell differentiation factors such as PAX5, IKZF1, and EBF-1 have been identified
  in more than half of all cases of childhood B precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  (ALL). Here, we describe a perturbed epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of
  ZNF423 in ALL as a novel mechanism interfering with B cell differentiation. Hypomethylation
  of ZNF423 regulatory sequences and BMP2 signaling result in transactivation of ZNF423Î±
  and a novel ZNF423Î²-isoform encoding a nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase
  complex-interacting domain. Aberrant ZNF423 inhibits the transactivation of EBF-1
  target genes and leads to B cell maturation arrest in vivo. Importantly, ZNF423
  expression is associated with poor outcome of ETV6-RUNX1-negative B precursor ALL
  patients. Our work demonstrates that ALL is more than a genetic disease and that
  epigenetics may uncover novel mechanisms of disease with prognostic implications.
