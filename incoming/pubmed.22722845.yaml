abstract: Tumour suppressor genes encode a broad class of molecules whose mutational
  attenuation contributes to malignant progression. In the canonical situation, the
  tumour suppressor is completely inactivated through a two-hit process involving
  a point mutation in one allele and chromosomal deletion of the other. Here, to identify
  tumour suppressor genes in lymphoma, we screen a short hairpin RNA library targeting
  genes deleted in human lymphomas. We functionally identify those genes whose suppression
  promotes tumorigenesis in a mouse lymphoma model. Of the nine tumour suppressors
  we identified, eight correspond to genes occurring in three physically linked 'clusters',
  suggesting that the common occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumours
  reflects selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the new tumour suppressors
  are adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) and eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 5A (eIF5A), two genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced
  as a product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway. Through
  a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes on tumorigenesis,
  we establish the polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumour suppressor network regulating
  apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and eIF5A often
  occur together in human lymphomas and co-suppression of both genes promotes lymphomagenesis
  in mice. Thus, some tumour suppressor functions can be disabled through a two-step
  process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.
