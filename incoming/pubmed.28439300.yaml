abstract: Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with risk for chronic gastritis
  (CG), gastric ulcer (GU), duodenal ulcer (DU), and gastric cancer (GC). The H. pylori
  Cag type IV secretion system (TFSS) translocates the virulence factor cytotoxin-associated
  gene A protein into host cells and plays an important role in initiating gastric
  carcinogenesis. The CagL and CagI proteins are components of the TFSS. The Arg-Gly-Asp
  (RGD) motif of CagL, and the six most distal C-terminal amino acids (Ser-Lys-Ile-Ile-Val-Lys,
  and Ser-Lys-Val-Ile-Val-Lys) of CagL and CagI are essential for TFSS adhesion to
  host cells. Additionally, the CagL variant Tyr58Glu59 was previously shown to be
  associated with GC patients.We isolated 43 H. pylori isolates from 17 CG, 8 GU,
  8 DU, and 10 GC patients in Southeast Asia. Total DNAs were extracted and sequenced
  with MiSeq. H. pylori strain ATCC 26695, which was isolated from CG patients, was
  used as a reference. We examined the full sequences of H. pylori cagL and cagI using
  whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and analyzed whether single nucleotide variants and
  amino acid changes (AACs) correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. Three isolates
  were excluded from the analysis due to cagPAI rearrangements. CagL RGD motifs were
  conserved in 39 isolates (97.5%). CagL-Glu59 and Ile234 in the C-terminal motif
  were more common in 10 H. pylori isolates from GC patients (pï¿½<ï¿½0.001 and pï¿½<ï¿½0.05,
  respectively). When 5 Vietnamese isolates from GC patients were excluded, CagL-Glu59
  still remains significant (pï¿½<ï¿½0.05), but not Ile234. CagL-Tyr58 was seen in
  only one isolate. The CagI C-terminal motif was completely conserved across all
  40 isolates, and there were no significant AACs in CagI.Using WGS, we analyzed genetic
  variants in clinical H. pylori isolates and identified putative novel and candidate
  variants in uncharacterized CagL and CagI sequences that are related to gastric
  carcinogenesis. In particular, CagL-Glu59 has the possible association with GC.
