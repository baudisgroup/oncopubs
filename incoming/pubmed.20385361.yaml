abstract: The neural stem cell marker CD133 is reported to identify cells within glioblastoma
  (GBM) that can initiate neurosphere growth and tumor formation; however, instances
  of CD133(-) cells exhibiting similar properties have also been reported. Here, we
  show that some PTEN-deficient GBM tumors produce a series of CD133(+) and CD133(-)
  self-renewing tumor-initiating cell types and provide evidence that these cell types
  constitute a lineage hierarchy. Our results show that the capacities for self-renewal
  and tumor initiation in GBM need not be restricted to a uniform population of stemlike
  cells, but can be shared by a lineage of self-renewing cell types expressing a range
  of markers of forebrain lineage.  Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
