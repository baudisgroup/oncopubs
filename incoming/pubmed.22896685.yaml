abstract: High-grade serous cancer (HGSC), the most common subtype of ovarian cancer,
  often becomes resistant to chemotherapy, leading to poor patient outcomes. Intratumoral
  heterogeneity occurs in nearly all solid cancers, including ovarian cancer, contributing
  to the development of resistance mechanisms. In this study, we examined the spatial
  and temporal genomic variation in HGSC using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism
  arrays. Multiple metastatic lesions from individual patients were analyzed along
  with 22 paired pretreatment and posttreatment samples. We documented regions of
  differential DNA copy number between multiple tumor biopsies that correlated with
  altered expression of genes involved in cell polarity and adhesion. In the paired
  primary and relapse cohort, we observed a greater degree of genomic change in tumors
  from patients that were initially sensitive to chemotherapy and had longer progression-free
  interval compared with tumors from patients that were resistant to primary chemotherapy.
  Notably, deletion or downregulation of the lipid transporter LRP1B emerged as a
  significant correlate of acquired resistance in our analysis. Functional studies
  showed that reducing LRP1B expression was sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of
  HGSC cell lines to liposomal doxorubicin, but not to doxorubicin, whereas LRP1B
  overexpression was sufficient to increase sensitivity to liposomal doxorubicin.
  Together, our findings underscore the large degree of variation in DNA copy number
  in spatially and temporally separated tumors in HGSC patients, and they define LRP1B
  as a potential contributor to the emergence of chemotherapy resistance in these
  patients.  ï¿½2012 AACR.
