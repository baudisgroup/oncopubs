abstract: Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, arises
  in the cerebellum and disseminates through the cerebrospinal fluid in the leptomeningeal
  space to coat the brain and spinal cord. Dissemination, a marker of poor prognosis,
  is found in up to 40% of children at diagnosis and in most children at the time
  of recurrence. Affected children therefore are treated with radiation to the entire
  developing brain and spinal cord, followed by high-dose chemotherapy, with the ensuing
  deleterious effects on the developing nervous system. The mechanisms of dissemination
  through the cerebrospinal fluid are poorly studied, and medulloblastoma metastases
  have been assumed to be biologically similar to the primary tumour. Here we show
  that in both mouse and human medulloblastoma, the metastases from an individual
  are extremely similar to each other but are divergent from the matched primary tumour.
  Clonal genetic events in the metastases can be demonstrated in a restricted subclone
  of the primary tumour, suggesting that only rare cells within the primary tumour
  have the ability to metastasize. Failure to account for the bicompartmental nature
  of metastatic medulloblastoma could be a major barrier to the development of effective
  targeted therapies.
