abstract: To investigate the genomic alterations in larynx carcinomas (LaCa) tissues
  and its prognostics values in predicting survival.  To analyse the aberrations in
  the genome of LaCa patients, we used array comparative genomic hybridization in
  19 human laryngeal tumour samples. DNA samples were also subjected to detect human
  papillomavirus (HPV) sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Copy number gain
  was confirmed by real-time PCR. The cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP-1)
  gene expression was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry assay on LaCa tissues.
  To identify prognostic feature, CRBP-1 gene gain was correlated to patient survival.  The
  most common gains were detected for CRBP-1 and EGFR genes, while DNA lost in RAF-1
  gene. Immunohistochemistry assay was revealed strong expression of CRBP1 protein
  in those cases with CRBP-1 gene gain. The CRBP-1 gene gain and its expression correlated
  significantly with survival (P = 0.003). Cox regression analysis indicated that
  CRBP-1 expression level was a factor of survival (P = 0.008). HPV sequences were
  detected in 42% of the samples, and did not show any relationship with specific
  gene alterations.  Our data shows that CRBP-1 gene gain can be determined by immunohistochemistry
  on routinely processed tissue specimens, and could support as a potential novel
  marker for long-term survival in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
