abstract: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous
  disease with a high proliferation rate. By integrating copy number data with transcriptional
  profiles and performing pathway analysis in primary DLBCLs, we identified a comprehensive
  set of copy number alterations (CNAs) that decreased p53 activity and perturbed
  cell cycle regulation. Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations
  of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53
  and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and
  increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker. CNAs
  of the CDKN2A-TP53-RB-E2F axis provide a structural basis for increased proliferation
  in DLBCL, predict outcome with current therapy, and suggest targeted treatment approaches.  Copyright
