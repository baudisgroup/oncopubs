# oncopubs

The _oncopubs_ repository contains information about research articles reporting original cancer genome screening experiments, by genome-spanning molecular cytogenetic or molecular methods.

Monitored technologies include:

* "cCGH" - Chromosomal based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)
* "aCGH" - genomic arrays, referring to two color CGH arrays as well as other genomic arrays suitable for reconstructing copy number aberration data (SNP arrays ...)
* "WES" - whole exome sequencing
* "WGS" - whole genome sequencing

The data is represented through the [publications portal](http://progenetix.org/publications/) of the Progenetix website.
